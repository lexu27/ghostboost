In the now time, people talk a lot about saving Confederate statues. Donald Trump, the old President, says these statues are very important for America and need to be saved. But many proofs show that most people think these statues should be taken down because they show unfair treatment to different races, especially Black people. They say most of these statues were put up not right after the Civil War, but later in the 1900s and 1920s, when laws against Black people were very unfair.

The United Daughters of the Confederacy paid for building these Confederate statues. Some think this was a plan to keep White people in power and make sure Black people had fewer rights. It is clear that these statues connect to racism because more statues were built in the 1920s to 1940s when Black people were fighting for their rights. These statues were put up in the Southern states, mostly at courthouses, to show that the law was on the side of White people. Because of this, many of these statues have been taken down recently because they are not fair to Black people.

If you think about it personally, it is easy to see that Confederate statues were made to keep White people strong. That is why some of these statues can be taken down, but not all. History has good and bad times. Even though many people want to get rid of everything from bad times, we should remember them to make sure they do not happen again.
