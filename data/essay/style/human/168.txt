Historically, police was started to keep people safe, have things, and be healthy. Police also stopped fights and bad things happening to people. Harris (2020) says police could use force or arrest people because the government said it was okay. Long ago, police families worked together to make sure everyone followed the rules. They wanted to protect people from bad people. 
The group thought if one person was hurt, it was like everyone was hurt (Harris, 2020). To do their job, police back then had three main things to do. They didn't force people, had many jobs, and knew who had to do police work. 
Police need to follow the law all the time, even when not working. In the U.S., police have to follow the rules of where they work. Police also have to do things right when they arrest people, keep evidence, and get help from others (Schroeder & Lombardo, 2018). Police should not do more than they are allowed to, and they can't take away people's freedom (Schroeder & Lombardo, 2018). Only when the law says so, police can break the rules about arresting people.
