The four goals of anti-bias education are very important. First, forming identity means each child knows who they are and who their family is. Second, promoting diversity means we learn to respect everyone's differences. Third, teaching justice means we learn what is right and wrong, and to be polite to everyone. Fourth, fostering activism means teaching kids to be brave and speak up. These goals help us teach people to be kind, take responsibility for their actions, and stand up against bad things happening.

The challenges of anti-bias education are making kids be nice even to people they don't like, being brave in class, and knowing what is right and wrong. When I was young, I was very shy and it was hard for me to talk. What helped me was having nice classmates and a teacher who taught us to respect differences.

Sometimes teachers can be unfair without knowing it. Some teachers may give good grades to students they like and bad grades to others. Some teachers think quiet students don't know anything. It's important to see these biases and fix them to give all kids equal opportunities. To fight biases, we should try to understand others, see things from their view, and think about all possibilities. When we fight biases, everyone benefits because people become more accepting of each other.
