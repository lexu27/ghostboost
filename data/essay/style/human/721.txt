Writers use different meanings in their stories. They want to express thoughts through pictures. People who read books alone see these meanings in their own way. Sometimes, the same ideas in books are not understood the same. Some writers use similar meanings with different pictures. One important idea is the use of dark and light images together. This is clear in the works of John Milton and William Shakespeare. They show that dark and light can be different but not always bad. This essay talks about these meanings in their works.

Shakespeareâ€™s play Othello has many contrasts. At the start, we see Othello, a dark man. In the 16th century, this was new because people were often mean to dark-skinned people. Othello is a good person, even though he looks different. Shakespeare wants to show that not all dark things are bad.

But Shakespeare also uses dark images to show bad things. Iago, a bad character, is often connected with dark things. He is different from the kind Desdemona, who wears white clothes. Iago is shown as a bad person next to her. So, dark images are used to show the difference between good and bad.

In another old book, Paradise Lost by John Milton, dark colors are used to show the Devil. Dark words are used to make things seem scary. This is different from the bright angels and God in the book. Milton uses dark images to show the difference between good and bad, light and dark.
