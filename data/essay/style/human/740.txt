Despite low job numbers in U.S, Black Americans face twice the job risk compared to white Americans. Bureau of Labor Numbers (BLS) said 7.1% of African Americans have no job, higher than the 4.2% national rate (BLS, 2022). Racism and learning unfairness in U.S make job issues. Racism in learning makes Black Americans get less learning, leading to more joblessness than others. 

U.S. racism is top reason for job gap. Even if same skills, blacks get jobs less than whites causing job issues. Montenovo et al. (2020) say most U.S. jobs come from friends, not ads, hurting blacks as many bosses are whites. U.S. has racial splits and bad rules stop equal jobs. 

Compared to whites, Black Americans have less learning. Many Black students leave school, school prices are high, and public schools are worse than private adding to learning gap. Good learning is tied to jobs, especially skilled jobs causing job problems (Gezici & Ozay, 2020). Most Black workers do low-skill jobs, facing job issues.

Learning gaps mean fewer Black jobs and most jobs for them are in manual work. Job differences by race are from racism and low learning for Black Americans. Racial profiling, unfair learning chances, and no rules against friend hiring. We need strong laws to fight U.S. racism and learning gaps to fix job gap between black and white Americans.
