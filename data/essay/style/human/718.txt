To understand why many people in the county have diabetes, we need to look at how many people have it in the whole country and here. The CDC (2022) says that although fewer new diabetes cases are happening now, young people under twenty still get it a lot. Old people don't handle diabetes well, and this can get better. Things like culture and society can make some people more likely to have diabetes. For example, Hispanics have it more. Other things like age, smoking, not moving around much, and being very overweight can also make more people have diabetes.
In our county, getting older, having high blood pressure, and being Hispanic are the main things that make people at risk. Old age and high blood pressure are usual for type 2 diabetes, but being Hispanic might be new because of social reasons (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, n.d.).
Hispanics might have a bit of a family link to diabetes because of what they eat, but not having good healthcare is the biggest risk. A study showed that not having good health insurance, being poor, and not knowing much about diabetes made more Hispanics have it (Bauer, 2017). So, it looks like many people don't know how to stop diabetes, so we need to teach them better.
