A bar graph shows data with bars up or sideways. The bar size shows the numbers. New York Times made a paper on 10th Feb 2022 about how the pandemic changed weddings. They used a graph to show yearly weddings from 1970 to 2022. Every year, there were 2.1 million weddings in the United States. But in 2020, the first year of COVID-19, weddings fell by 38% to 1.3 million (Osisanwo, 2021). A graph is useful in articles because it gives a summary in the discussion part. In the article, the graph shows most weddings in 2020 were done online with few guests due to COVID-19 rules.
Graphs help explain things clearly, making data easy to understand. In 2021, COVID-19 rules were eased, and weddings went up to 1.9 million from the year before. Fewer weddings worry about birth rates in countries (Osisanwo, 2021). Graphs share info and interest readers. By comparing yearly weddings, readers can guess future trends. They see a clear picture of the article and lots of data on a small page.
Simple, standard, and scalable are key for a useful chart. Simple means easy to understand. The title should be clear (Osisanwo, 2021). Data should be standard and not hard to grasp. Scalable means the chart can handle more data. Use the right chart for more data. In short, charts help readers compare and analyze data easily.
