The book Atonement by Ian McEwan talks about writing. The writer uses different tools to say many things in the book. By using an all-knowing storyteller, the writer tries to show how someone feels when they try to fix their mistakes by writing. The main person in the book, Briony, shows that writing can help people accept their mistakes. The writer uses irony and an all-knowing storyteller to show how writing can help with sadness and guilt.

Writing and storytelling about guilt, loss, or pain is mostly shown through two tools. The first one is irony: situational and verbal. Irony is when the writer talks about something but means the opposite. The truth is not in the words but in the hidden meaning. The writer uses verbal irony to show the characters’ feelings more deeply. “Now you’re eating only salad while we suffer” (121). This kind of irony is used to show the narrator’s bad actions. This way of writing is a method to admit to being wrong. “When the hurt ones were screaming, you thought about living in a small house with someone” (227). This quote also shows the narrator’s belief in her bad actions towards her loved ones.

When making a book, the storyteller wants to give characters a chance to live differently. The storyteller says she took away the lives of the people she loved. People can't come back to life, and the storyteller can't be forgiven. So, she writes a book where she can say sorry for her mistakes. Situational irony is used to show the narrator feeling sorry and using writing to deal with her sadness. At the end of the book, the narrator admits that the characters never got back together (310). The happy ending is there because she decides to say sorry for her mistakes through the book. Unable to change their lives, the writer makes a new life for them in the story.

Another thing helping to talk about the topic is the all-knowing storyteller. In these kinds of books, the storyteller acts as a character and uses “I” to talk about herself. This kind of storyteller helps show the thoughts and feelings of the narrator, which are hidden and not known to others. “How can a writer say sorry when she can decide what happens, like a god?” (325). This example shows that writing is a way to deal with sadness. But, the way of telling the story helps readers see that the narrator wants to be with her loved ones and can't get over being apart from them. Actually, readers understand that saying sorry was impossible for the narrator. Through writing, she gives her life to the people she hurt. Even if Briony can't fully say sorry for her mental pain, she eases her sadness and guilt through writing.

The topic we talked about is important for me and all of society to understand the writer’s feelings. Life is unpredictable, and many bad things can happen that stay with people forever. Everyone finds their way to deal with these bad things. Writing is a good way to stay true to loved ones and show regrets. It feels good when readers read and accept the writer’s apologies. For me, writing can help stay good morally and remember losses and sad events, which is important for the way society grows ethically and keeps its culture alive.
