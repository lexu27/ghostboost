One way sociology can help understand how race and health differences are connected is by making a clear definition of race that looks at the important parts. Even now, when people know that race is made up by society, sometimes it is still influenced by ideas from physical anthropology and genes. A good sociological way to look at race and health differences can help by looking at how race sorts people, like being poor and being treated badly (Hummer, 1996). This way can help focus on the most important money-related things that affect health and, in this way, help us know better how things are connected.

Another way sociology can help explain why race and health differences happen is by talking about the place where people live and how it affects their health. For example, sociology can be really useful in explaining how easy it is for people to live a healthy life and eat good food. Kwate (2008) gives an example of this in a study about how where people live and how many fast food places are there. He looks at the people, money, place, and social things of a neighborhood to see why there are more fast food places in black neighborhoods that are kept separate (Kwate, 2008). By doing this, Kwate (2008) wants to show that we need to look at the real reasons behind why race and health differences happen, not just easy ideas like thinking black people like fast food more. So, like in the last example, using sociology can help us focus on the true reasons for how race and health differences are connected.
