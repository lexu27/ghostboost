I study the signs and why lung cancer happens more in this homework. Lung cancer is a common illness and not many get better from it. Because of how lungs work, most tumors quickly cannot be removed. Each year, about 40,000 people in the United States find out they have this sickness. When lung cancer starts, there are usually no signs, but later on, people start to have some. A long-lasting cough, coughing up blood, having trouble breathing, feeling very tired for no reason, losing weight, and feeling pain when breathing or coughing are signs of lung cancer.
Even if someone never smoked, they can still get lung cancer, but smoking is the biggest reason. This is because smoking means breathing in many harmful things often, causing nearly 72% of cases (Oâ€™Keeffe et al., 2018). The treatment changes based on the kind of change in the tumor, how far it has spread, and how healthy the person is. If the issue is found early and the bad cells are only in a small area, doctors might suggest removing that part of the lung. If surgery isn't an option because of overall health, doctors might use radiation to kill the bad cells instead. Chemotherapy is used a lot when the cancer has spread too much for surgery or radiation to help.
