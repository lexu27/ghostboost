Millions of people in the world have mental problems like being very worried or scared. One of these problems is called OCD. It makes people have strange thoughts and do things over and over. This problem is hard to control. We can learn more about it by looking at four things.
  * Feeling bad: OCD makes people feel strange when they have to fight bad thoughts and do things to feel less scared. They can't stop these actions and feel very nervous and sad.
  * Daily life: OCD makes it hard for people to do their daily activities. Bad thoughts make it tough to work normally, and people feel they must do things many times. This can take a long time.
