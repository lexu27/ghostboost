Assessment of Curriculum
Assessment of curriculum is very important for school. It helps to see how much students learn. It is like a test to know what students know (Dikli, 2003). Tests are used a lot in school. Some common tests are multiple-choice, true/false, short-answer, and essays. These tests help to see if students know what they should know. They are made the same for everyone in the class or school. Traditional tests are easy to make, use, and grade. They are fair and people like them (Dikli, 2003). Another type of test is performance tests or authentic tests. They look at what students can do, not just what they know. These tests can be projects or portfolios. They help to see how good students are at things and what they know too. 
Roles in Evaluation
In my school, teachers teach and give tests to students. Tests are important for teachers to see how good they are at teaching. Teachers don't decide what to teach, but they need to help students do well on tests. Teachers need to make tests that fit their students and what they teach. This helps to know what students are good at and what they need help with.
