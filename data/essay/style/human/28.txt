Understaffing is a big problem in healthcare in the USA and other countries. This is a big problem in the healthcare place we are looking at. I am a nurse assistant, and I know that not having enough staff makes work hard for employees and not good for patients. Nurses get tired, make mistakes, and patients are not happy with the care they get. Understaffing was a big problem before COVID, but it got worse during COVID. To help, we can use a five-step plan from Cox et al. (2014). This paper talks about how we used this plan to fix understaffing in the hospital.

Step 1 is finding the main problem (what makes care bad). Understaffing is the main problem as it causes more mistakes, unhappy staff, and bad work. Patients don't get good care because nurses don't have time to talk, do procedures, and finish tasks.

Step 2 of the plan finds ways to fix the problem. The problem gets worse in flu seasons. So, we can give more hours to part-time assistants who can do many jobs, so nurses can focus on tasks they need skills for. We need clear rules on what each worker should do.

Step 3 says everyone must work together to fix the problem. All workers need to know the changes, why they are needed, and what might happen if we don't change. We can make teams with leaders to help the change.

Step 4 checks how well the changes are working. Patients and employees can fill out short surveys to say if care is good and if workers are happy and not tired. Step 5 is easy to do as we can have contracts for busy times.

To fix understaffing, we can add more nurse assistants when needed. The five-step plan can help make changes in the hospital. Everyone working together is very important. This plan can also help with other issues in healthcare.
