End-Stage Renal Failure (ESRF) is when the kidneys don't work well due to a sickness. ESRF makes life hard because the body gets sick. Lots of adults in the US have ESRF, and many people worldwide have it too. More people are getting ESRF because there are more people in the world. ESRF is dangerous and makes people sick.

The belly where the kidneys are is where ESRF happens. The kidneys get weak and can't clean the blood. This can cause issues with blood clotting and low levels of some things in the blood. The body can have problems getting rid of waste. ESRF can also affect the brain, causing sleep issues and trouble concentrating.

There are special beginnings to describe ESRF, like nephro- and hemato-. These words talk about the sickness in the kidneys and blood. ESRF can cause blood clotting issues, so thrombo- can also be used. Adding -al or -ic to words can help explain more about ESRF. 

Words like renal, nephric, and nephritic relate to the kidneys. Nephrosis is used to talk about how the kidneys get worse. Some words show things coming from the kidneys, like nephrogenic and renogenic. Other words like renopathy and nephropathy talk about kidney problems. 

ESRF can make the body make less blood cells, which is called hematopoiesis. The sickness can lead to heart and blood issues like high blood pressure and heart inflammation. ESRF can also cause muscle problems, skin irritation, and diarrhea.
