1972 German sad event at Olympic Games was big surprise for people around world. Even though bad people were known in 1970s, safety was not good enough to stop bad guys from coming into Olympic village in Munich (Hirsch, 2020). Spindlove and Simonsen (2018) said, "On September 5, 1972, eight people from Black September group from Palestine came into village" and "got nine Israeli people as captives" (p. 160). They asked to let more than 200 prisoners from Palestine go free in exchange for athletes, who would be hurt if request was not met (Spindlove & Simonsen, 2018). Leaders from two countries said no to bad guys' demands. So, German army shot at bad guys and captives, and all of them died (Spindlove & Simonsen, 2018). After that, Germany made rules to control Arabs coming into country to avoid more sad events. Games had weak security without weapons (History, 2021). Also, people think bad guys got help from Olympics organizers, but not sure (Reeve, 2018). Germany made GSG-9 group to fight bad guys (Spindlove & Simonsen, 2018). They stop bad people and save captives in case of attack (Reeve, 2018). Politicians had talks with Palestine group and Arab leaders to stop more attacks (Hirsch, 2020). This made Germany and world feel bad. 
Israel's answer was tough because they chased and killed bad people, and called it "Wrath of God." Prime Minister said they did not talk with bad guys because no Israeli felt safe (History, 2021). They wanted revenge for dead athletes and make Palestinians scared. So, Israel found and killed everyone involved in Munich sad event (Reeve, 2018). This went on for more than twenty years with some wins and losses for Mossad (Reeve, 2018). It was really bad for Israelis and world. 
In short, sad event at 1972 Olympic Games in Germany showed problems with safety. Since bad people hurt Israeli athletes, who died during rescue, Israel was ready to fight them. Germany also made a group to fight bad people in country. Overall, Munich sad event made people more aware of bad people around world and made countries work together to stop bad things.
