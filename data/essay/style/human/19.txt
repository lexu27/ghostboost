I go to Museum on Saturday 12 February this year from 9 am to 5 pm. Museum in Houston named Holocaust Museum Houston it is a place to teach people about badness and unfairness. It has words "Stop Hate" and "Letâ€™s begin here." They say bad things like not liking others and not caring are not good. If bad things happen a lot, there could be a big bad thing like the Holocaust again. There is a part in the museum about the Holocaust and other big bad events to show badness is not good. They show stories from people who survived the Holocaust in Houston. The museum shows how Jewish people lived before and during the World War. I like the part where they show things that happened in nature. They show parts of African American culture and dance. Sport part was cool with things from players like Gabby Douglas and Serena Williams. Music part was good too. I learned a lot at the Holocaust Museum. I saw how bad things were for many people during the Holocaust. I learned from drawings and stories of survivors. It was sad to see the train car where people suffered. I wished to see more things in the museum like a model of a camp. Medicine history after the Holocaust is important for understanding ethics. It helps us to be better people. Everyone should visit the Holocaust Museum Houston to learn about badness and why it is bad. It teaches us to be kind and remember history. It is important for all people in the world.
