Dreaming is very fun and strange feeling that happens in the brain when sleeping. Before this class, I did not think dreams were important. I thought dreams were just the brain keeping busy with daily thoughts at night. But, after learning about dreams, I saw there are other reasons for them. This class helped me pay more attention to dreams to understand my feelings and why students have bad dreams.

I found it interesting that students from Jordan have dreams like students from Western countries. I learned from Nasser & Bulkeley (2009) that many people remember bad dreams more. These bad dreams are often about their worries from the day. Dreaming about things like jinn shows their culture and beliefs. It was cool to see how the brain turns thoughts into dreams. I used to dream about characters from books and movies, but now I see my brain can make up stories with me in them. I noticed that I felt lonely in my dreams, which made me think maybe dreams prepare us for tough times in real life.

Some people have dreams that seem to predict the future, which is a mystery. Reading about Icelandic stories by Heijnen (2005) changed my mind about dreams. I used to think dreams were just personal thoughts not important. I didn't start believing in superstitions about dreams, but now I think more about why we dream certain things.

There is no proof that the stories in the article are true, but many people today have similar dreams. I learned that many people talk to dead loved ones in dreams, even my relatives. I do not agree with Icelanders who think dreams come from outside us. This article showed me that science cannot explain everything, so we should be open to different ideas about the mind.

In conclusion, this class taught me many things about dreams. I used to think dreams were just our brains processing daily life. It is partly true, as studies show we dream about our worries, likely due to culture and expecting bad things. The scariest part of dreams is when they involve supernatural things, influenced by beliefs and imagination. These dreams are not the same worldwide, making it hard to explain them with psychology. I believe more research with experts from different fields is needed to understand dreams better.
