Overcrowding is a big problem because it makes the environment and society feel bad. Lots of people use up all the earth's things like water and animals, which makes it hard to save them (Weber & Sciubba, 2019). So, we really need to stop having too many people because it will help save our planet (Weber & Sciubba, 2019). It's important for everyone to help control how many people there are because more people mean we take too much from nature like fishing too much, making water dirty, and hurting the soil, which makes things run out.

Water is running out because we use too much when there are more people. Also, we make water dirty from factories and throwing things in the sea, which makes the water less (Weber & Sciubba, 2019). More people means we want more fish, so we catch too many, and they disappear (Weber & Sciubba, 2019). The ground where we grow plants is getting worse because we farm a lot to feed everyone and let animals eat too much grass (Weber & Sciubba, 2019). This makes the ground not good anymore, and we lose many different plants and animals. All these things happen because we try to give everything to so many people (Weber & Sciubba, 2019). Everyone needs to help stop this problem since people's actions hurt nature. We can have fewer people by talking about having less babies and finding new ways to save things like not throwing in the sea.
