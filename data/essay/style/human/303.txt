COVID-19 changed the world in many ways. The final results of the pandemic are not yet clear. One area that still needs more research is healthcare. This is very important for mental health. Many resources go to fighting the physical effects of the virus. Mental health is not focused on as much, but it is important, especially for healthcare workers. They face big burdens from the pandemic, which can cause trauma, depression, and anxiety. Nurses and women have even higher risks. The main reasons for these problems are fear of the unknown and fear of getting sick.

Healthcare managers need to find new ways to help their workers cope with stress. Different strategies have been tried worldwide, depending on resources and cultural backgrounds. The three main ways to help workers are self-help, talking with others, and knowing about stress at work. Managers can choose which to use based on what they have.

Workers in New York used six main ways to cope with stress during COVID-19. Some did not do anything to cope. Managers can share these methods with their workers. Sometimes, self-help is not enough, and workers need more help. In China, they balanced work and rest, improved safety, and provided mental health services. This helped workers feel better and sleep more.

It's hard for workers to know if they have depression or stress issues. In emergencies, there is little time to think about mental health. Stress can harm workers and patients. Regular screenings can help workers and patients stay safe.
