It is very important to fix all mistakes and missing things in money papers. So, there is a special way to make wrong things right. First, we check the old money paper to see if there is a mistake. Then, we look at how the mistake affects the money the company has. After that, we can do two things to fix the mistake. The money person can cancel the wrong thing and put in a new thing that is correct. Also, the money person can write down a new thing that will fix the mistake together with the wrong thing. For example, if we buy things for $20 but write it in the wrong place, we can fix it by writing $20 in the right place and taking it out from the wrong place at the same time.
