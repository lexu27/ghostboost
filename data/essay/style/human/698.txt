For Sanlu, bad stuff in their milk was found at a very bad time. The people involved in the problem were mainly Sanlu bosses, people who give them stuff, farmers, and people who take the milk. They were told not to tell anyone about the bad stuff. Fonterra, a big milk trader and Sanlu’s friend, is also a big part of this, but they were told about the bad stuff in the milk. It took five weeks for Sanlu and Fonterra to decide what to do to not make things worse. Fonterra took back all their milk, but Sanlu said no because they were scared of looking bad and putting babies in danger. The government of New Zealand had to step in for the Chinese company to say sorry and take back the bad milk. Over fifty thousand kids got sick with stones in their kidneys, and four died. So, Sanlu is not a good company. The bad milk problem hurt many other people too. The government is in trouble for letting this happen because of prices. The government also slowed down taking back the bad milk. People who gave milk to Fonterra and Sanlu lost money, and some got in trouble for adding bad stuff to the milk. The owners of Sanlu and Fonterra wanted to keep quiet to not lose money. The news didn’t look into the sick kids because the government said no bad news during the Olympics. This shows how the news can be stopped from telling important things.
