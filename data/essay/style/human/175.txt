The Poem of The Righteous Sufferer is a Mesopotamian poem about a man who suffers a lot. The Poem is not very big, only about 500 lines, and it is written in a language called Akkadian. It is important because, around the year 1300 B.C., people started to see the need for being good. The story is about a man who talks about his gods but has many sicknesses. The Poem shows how he feels far from the gods, and it talks about unfairness and being good. This poem helps the people from that time to know more about the values and ideas of ancient Mesopotamia.

The Poem is seen as one of the first stories in the Bible’s Old Testament. The man in the Poem does something bad and then feels sorry for it, which is an important part of the Poem. It is also important to know how the Babylonians thought about the gods. The man in the Poem learns that not everything good for him is good for the gods. He complains about unfairness and says that even if he is rich, bad things happen to him.

The Poem shows how people started to think differently about life and its meaning. It shows that being good does not always mean the gods will treat you well. Unfairness affects society a lot, and the man in the Poem does not understand why he is suffering. Even when he gets better, he is not happy and thinks he will die soon because he believes it is what God wants. People at that time had to trust the gods, even if they did not explain why bad things happened.

The problems in the Poem show what the man in the story thinks. He feels happy when he honors God, praises the king, and helps the country grow. He is like a person from a long time ago who goes through hard times. His suffering, following traditions, and being a good person are important. These good things give him hope, and this is why stories like this one influenced the Bible. People believed that only by trusting and hoping in the gods could they get their favor.

Looking at the story, we see how the man is connected to society. He wonders why he is not treated well even after doing good things and praising God. He thinks about why good people do not get good things. The story shows that the man is confused and worried about why the gods bring bad things to society.
