Being good at your job is very important. Many medical students try to learn a lot before they finish school. This is good, but I learned that what makes doctors successful is how they connect with patients. I saw this when I watched Dr. Wang work. Dr. Wang is a doctor who works on eyes. I was surprised to see how well she/he can make friends with the people who come to the Eye Surgery Institute. I realized Dr. Wang has some special skills. First, she/he listens carefully to patients without interrupting. Second, Dr. Wang is always nice and patient with everyone. Lastly, Dr. Wang is friendly, especially with patients she/he sees a lot. For example, I heard Dr. Wang ask about a patient's daughter because she was sick last time they met. Because Dr. Wang treats people this way, they trust her/him and share their problems. This helps Dr. Wang give better treatment. I want to be like Dr. Wang and learn to connect with patients too. I hope my story about Dr. Wang will help other medical workers improve how they talk to people.
