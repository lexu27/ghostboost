In law job, a gift called gratuity is given to police officers. Often, it's a nice gesture like free coffee or small gifts (Fleming, 2019). One reason to allow gratuities is that it's a choice without bad meanings, unlike bribes (Fleming, 2019). But, it's hard to tell the difference between tips, gratuities, and bribes, which is a main reason not to allow gratuities.

If I was boss of police, I would say no to gratuities to keep a good image. I think a gratuity can lead to bad things or look bad to people. So, I think police should not take gratuities and just get praise instead.
