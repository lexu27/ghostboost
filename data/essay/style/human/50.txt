Supporters of relativism think that there is no real right or wrong. Moral rules in society are not always needed to follow. Evil and good are just stories, not real things. A researcher named Porus said that relativism could turn into letting everything be okay. People who believe this might seem like they don't care about what's right or wrong and won't try to make fair deals.

On the other hand, objectivism says there are clear right and wrong things that don't change based on what people think. Moral rules are thought to be always true and not made by people. There are different ways to think about objectivism, but the main idea is to believe in one true way. It's opposite to relativism in every way. Objectivism does admit that some moral rules can change, but at its heart, it's about knowing good and bad.

I like relativism more even though there are some problems with it. While absolute right and wrong can show that there's no main moral idea and can't be trusted, relativism is more down-to-earth. Every day we make choices, and sometimes it's hard to say if they're good or bad. Most people try to do the right thing, but sometimes others don't see it that way. You can't please everyone because even if you think you're doing the right thing, it depends on your experiences, feelings, and the situation. Objectivism seems too perfect and simple, and it doesn't match how things really are.
