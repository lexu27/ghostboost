With many different animals and some in trouble, people may think no new animals can be found. But, new animals are still found. One new animal found recently is the orange bat. It's called Nimba myotis or Myotis nimbaensis. This bat has orange fur with black spots and is different from other bats. It lives in caves and hunts using sound. Because not much is known about it, what it eats is a mystery. This bat is special.

The orange bat is in the animal group, specifically in the Chiroptera order and Vespertilionidae family. It's an animal because it's a mammal and has babies in a special way. It's made of many cells without walls, just like other animals. So, it's an animal, a mammal. Also, this bat is one of the biggest groups of mammals after rats. Finding this new bat has taught us more about bats.
