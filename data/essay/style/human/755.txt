In terms of military, leading in battles, and taking over lands, few kings from the past can be like Alexander the Great. He started a new Greek age and spread Greek ways from Greece to Egypt and even to India, changing the old world forever. He did all of this before he was 32 years old, making people wonder what more he could have done if he lived longer.

If Alexander went further east, he would have seen the Chinese in their ‘Warring States Time’ and met the strong Qin State, which later joined China together. But since his army was sad and tired from fighting in faraway lands, they probably wouldn’t have reached China. The soldiers didn’t want to keep going after so much time away from home.

Adding strangers to Alexander’s groups for managing his land and army would have helped make things easier, but it also made the Macedonians not trust him. To make people do what he wanted, Alexander liked to punish them hard, and being away a lot didn’t help him be liked. However, how he treated his friend Harpalus, giving him many jobs in the government, shows that he let personal feelings affect his choices. This isn’t surprising, though, since Alexander was having a hard time mentally, feeling scared and lonely in his later years ruling.
