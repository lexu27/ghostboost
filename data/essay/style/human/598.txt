Plato uses different writing techniques to say that people often miss out on learning new things about reality. The Cave Story uses many stories and symbols to explain this. For example, the cave with prisoners shows how our knowledge is like being in a dark place. Being in a dark place stops a person from seeing the real world.

Plato also talks about light as a way to see the truth. He compares philosophers to prisoners who escape the cave. Philosophers want to learn more about the world outside the cave. Plato uses stories and symbols to share his ideas.

Plato asks a lot of questions in his story. He asks questions to make readers think. He wants readers to see that truth has a limit and people only believe what they want to believe. Plato’s questions help readers understand his points better.
