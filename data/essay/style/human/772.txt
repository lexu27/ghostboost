For Asia and Asian countries, WWII was very bad. Big countries from Europe had no more things, so they couldn't control their places during WWII. They were busy with their own problems, and people in their countries didn't like being ruled. After WWII, the places that helped their rulers got freedom. Some places that got freedom were the Philippines from the United States in 1946, India from the United Kingdom in 1947, Ceylon and Burma in 1948, and more.

Before WWII, Japan wanted to be more powerful. Japan started taking over other places in 1931 with Manchuria, and then in 1937, they attacked China. Japan became friends with Germany and Italy in a group called the "Axis". The United States stopped trading with Japan to stop them from fighting and to make their soldiers leave China. Japan didn't have enough oil and resources, and they wanted to be stronger than the United States in the Pacific. Japan planned to fight the United States and British in Asia and take their things. Japan started to change in the 19th century. Asian countries started following Western culture to be a part of the world and make friends with other countries.
