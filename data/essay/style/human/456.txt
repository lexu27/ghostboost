Osteoarthritis is a sickness that affects people all around the world, but sometimes not treated correctly in hospitals. It makes older people have trouble moving, feel pain, and have a lower quality of life. It is guessed to cost $303 billion each year (Abramoff & Caldera, 2020). This bad illness needs more work to stop it from happening, lessen the pain, and prevent losing the ability to move.

Osteoarthritis is bad for the cartilage, which gets worse over time. The smooth cartilage at the ends of long bones and in the backbones is called articular cartilage. It helps bones move smoothly and can hold a lot of weight. Even though cartilage takes a long time to get bad, it doesn't heal quickly if it gets hurt. Not just the cartilage, but also the joint, the synovium, the joint ligaments, and the bone below the cartilage are affected.

Osteoarthritis is not thought about enough, even though it costs a lot for people, money, and society. Even if it happens with heart issues, diabetes, or mental health problems, and makes them worse, it is not part of the big plans to fight diseases. People with osteoarthritis might think there are no good treatments and believe they have to live with the pain. They might not know what to do to get better. Doctors might not suggest important things like exercise or losing weight, and might give them expensive medicines that don't work. I think this part is the most interesting in the article and the way people see the illness. I think helping people with osteoarthritis through therapy that combines physical and mental help could be good.
