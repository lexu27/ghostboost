What is Mediterranean food?
Mediterranean food is very popular right now. It comes from four countries near the sea: Morocco, Greece, Italy, and Spain. The food has fruits, veggies, nuts, fish, and good fats. Many people like this food because it is easy to make and uses simple ingredients.
Menu
The menu has two parts: a small dish and a main meal. It is important to cook quickly, especially for the small dish. The small dish is the first dish you eat before the main dish.
The small dish is Mushroom Soup, and the main dish is Boston Lobster Pasta. Both dishes are simple and not expensive. To make them look Mediterranean, you need to cook them in a modern way. For the soup, you add parsley foam, and for the lobster, you cook it with Sous Vide.
Mushroom Soup
For the soup, you need mushrooms, butter, flour, cream, parsley, truffle, and salt. You cook the mushrooms with butter, flour, and cream, then blend it. Add salt and parsley foam on top.
Cooking Steps
The steps for cooking are important to follow. The time to cook each part is also important. If you cook for more people, you need to adjust the time. The soup is low in calories and high in protein.
Modern Cooking: Foam
Foam is a special way to make food fluffy. It is used in many dishes like soup and ice cream. Foam helps make food light and tasty. Protein is needed to make good foam.
Tasting
When you eat the soup, it should be creamy, smell good, and taste yummy. These things make you want to eat more. It also helps you get ready for the main dish.
Making Mistakes
When cooking the soup, you should not cook too fast or use too much water. These mistakes can change the taste. It's also important not to overcrowd the pan.

Modern Cooking: Sous Vide
