The book, “Coaching habit: Say less, ask more & change the way you lead forever”, is by Stanier M. Bungay. It came out in 2016 from Box of Crayons Press. The writer and publishers say they provide “managers with tools to coach in ten minutes or less” (Bungay, 2016, p. 1). One big idea in the book is that silence doesn't mean no knowledge or disrespect. This point is repeated in some chapters because many managers often think silence means disrespect. The author says sometimes silence can mean deep thinking. The book explains that good coaching can help managers and leaders see these situations and help both the junior staff and their boss grow.

The author seems to think coaching is only for the manager because most advice is for supervisors. The role of junior staff should also have been looked at because coaching involves them too. The book talks about important questions called question masterclasses that are vital for good coaching. The first question, the kick start question, is crucial. The author says it is a question that starts the conversation quickly and deeply. Listening is a key part of coaching. This connects to many studies on the topic. Bungay (2016) uses this as his conclusion, which summarizes the topic well.
