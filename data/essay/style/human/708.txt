As business helper at Sun City Boards, I say company should use SWOT analysis as tool for good managing. To begin, company must make clear goals and decide actions to reach these goals. Goals come from company's mission and vision statements. They tell what company wants to do, not what it can do. So, company should use SWOT analysis to solve its business issues.
Sun City Boards can use SWOT analysis to use strengths, fix weaknesses, stop threats, and use opportunities. Biggest weakness is not planning, affecting how much money company makes. Company must set clear goals and aims to guide its work. Also, company must avoid threats like competition from other companies selling similar products. Making top-quality surf boards can help company stand out. Company can also use opportunities by thinking about selling more products to reach more customers. It can make cheaper boards for more people.
SWOT analysis helps company see its strengths and weaknesses, opportunities and threats in market. It can help company plan for future growth or deal with current problems to move company forward. SWOT analysis will show Sun City Boards why it's important to set goals from its mission and vision. Company will also see why mission and vision statements are good for planning. SWOT analysis will show company where it stands and help it make smart choices to use strengths, opportunities, and make new business chances.
