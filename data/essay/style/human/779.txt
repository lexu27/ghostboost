I have a picture here. It shows many people, but the main focus is on one person in the middle. He is with people who seem like office workers (they wear business clothes) and regular people. Their faces show confusion, feeling unfairness, and disorder.

When I look closer at this picture, I want to say that I like the person in the middle. It is hard not to think of Nelson Mandela when you see him in the picture. So, after reading about the picture, you start to remember when it was taken. As you see the picture, you can feel what the person in the middle feels; he looks sure he did nothing wrong. You notice how he stands out from others in the picture (MacDonald, 1). It is interesting that Mandela faces the people in suits while regular people stand behind him, ready to help. This shows the struggle between the government and regular people. Nelson Mandela seems like a brave hero who believes in himself and his success. The photo's maker supports Mandela, showing it with different visual effects.

This picture touches me deeply; I want to think about and see the picture, imagine what Mandela is saying now and what people are yelling in support. It feels good. This work is what we call “touches your heart deeply,” the picture shows a very important event in history and gives the right feeling, so we feel true emotions.
