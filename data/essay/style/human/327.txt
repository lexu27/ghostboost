Social responsibility means rules that companies follow to make sure they work well for everyone. These rules help save nature, make life better for people, and give a good work environment by appreciating good workers. This makes clients like the company more because they feel they are supporting good projects, which brings in more money and new investors.

The company gives praise to workers, which they like. Workers get to show others what to do and make choices alone, showing they are trusted and good (Yang et al., 2019). They also get extra money like bonuses and time off, which helps them work better and feel happy.

The company acts responsibly by following a code of ethics, which tells workers how to act on important things like morals, environment, and helping clients. It makes sure workers are safe and that suppliers know what is expected, like good prices. It checks suppliers' past actions and talks about what is needed.

I think the company should let workers share ideas more to be more creative. This would lead to better projects and more innovation (Tamvada, 2020). Even though some people complain about the company's actions and spending, it is clear they are trying to improve, which is good for everyone. As they become better known, they will sell more.

Nestle is trying to be a good and green company. They have helped communities a lot by raising living standards and providing clean water. I think they should use a process called Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) to find and handle possible problems (Tamvada, 2020). This will help them control risks and reach their goals.
