It is not surprise for anyone that professional sport is hard. Athletes say how tough training, lifestyle rules, being alone, and time pressure affect their minds. These problems are hard, but the pressure to always be strong makes it even harder outside of competitions. A story in The New York Times talks about how gymnast Simone Biles did not follow this rule at the 2020 Olympics. It looks at how emotions in sports and being open about them can be costly.

The article talks about how people now accept that athletes struggle mentally. A few years back, a top athlete like Simone Biles would not have said she had pressure, let alone leave a big competition. Simone's choice to leave the Olympics has started an important talk. Doing well in sports needs discipline and struggle, but when is it okay to stop and rest? After her choice, Simone got negative comments online, saying she was not patriotic or strong. For many, winning is more important than how athletes feel. This attitude can lead to problems like burn-out if mental health is not taken seriously.

The article also talks about Sian Beilock, who studies how pressure affects athletes and business people. Beilock says athletes opening up about mental health issues is important to fight the stigma. If successful athletes like Biles and Osaka can have anxiety and depression, regular people should not expect too much from themselves.

Failing in a big moment can be hard for athletes. Taking a break and admitting pressure might be smart for long-term success in sports. Success comes when you know your limits and ask for help. Enduring too much does not always mean being stronger in competitions. Each person has their own strengths, and it is important to use them wisely while taking care of mental health needs.
