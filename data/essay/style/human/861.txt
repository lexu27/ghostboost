Article Counterpoint: Cultural Protectionism Is Necessary in Canada is written by Jeff Klassen and is published in Canadian Points of View: Cultural Protectionisms, which is the property of Great Neck Publishing. The main idea of the paper says that cultural protectionism is very important for Canada in cultural, economic, and political ways. Canada is actively working on this, but the fast globalization and American influence make it hard to save their culture and identity. This article wants to show what is happening in the world and why cultural protectionism is important.

The author talks a lot about money stuff to show why he thinks this way, saying that Canada, a stable place, wants to protect its industries from America. Klassen focuses on media and art, which have lots of competition from other countries. All the numbers in the article show that companies don't get enough money and protection, and people don't care much.

In Klassen's writing, he wants to keep Canadian culture different from America without being mean. He gives examples of what Canada does to protect its culture, like supporting the UNESCO Diversity Convention and making Canadian media. He compares everything to America to show the differences. The article ends by saying that protecting culture is important for Canada's money and culture, but they don't want to fight with America.
