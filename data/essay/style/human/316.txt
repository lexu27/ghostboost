Hospital owie from staying too long in bed is called a HAPI. It hurts the skin when patients don't move for a long time, and there's pressure on their bones. Age, blood flow, food, sickness, and diabetes can make it worse. Lots of patients in the USA still get this owie, even though less now. HAPI makes patients more likely to die in the hospital or soon after. It hurts a lot, takes a long time to get better, and makes hospital stays longer. Nurses look after patients in the hospital to try and stop this owie from happening. They need to find out why it happens and fix it early. If they don't, it can be really bad for patients and take longer to heal. This makes hospital stays even longer and costs more money. To help stop this owie in older patients, we can use special sheets and beds to reduce the risk. We can check if these things work by looking at how many patients get the owie after using them for a year. The question we ask is: Can we stop elderly patients from getting this owie by using special sheets and beds compared to other methods in one year?
