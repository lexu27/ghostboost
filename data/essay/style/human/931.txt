The UCR website show that in 2020, there were 398.5 violent crimes for every 100,000 people. This is more than in 2019, when it was 380.8. Georgia had 400.1 violent crimes in 2020, which is more than in 2019 with 326.2. Minnesota had 277.5 crimes in 2020, up from 237.5. This means that crimes have gone up in many places.
In 2019, there were 1,203,808 violent crimes in the United States. This was less than in 2018, so crime rates went down by 0.5. The South had the most crimes in 2019, followed by the Midwest. The Northeast and West had the least crimes.
The UCR database shows the big picture of crime in the US, but not the changes well. The Crime in the United States database gives more details about crimes in recent years. It does not compare states and populations well. This data is important for understanding how crime affects victims. I disagree a bit with the post as reported crimes may have increased, not the actual crimes.
