Confidence intervals are tools to help know how certain a sample is. Researchers use small groups instead of all people because it's hard to test everyone. Confidence intervals make it safer to guess the whole group's values from just a small part. In healthcare, these tools are super important to keep people safe from sickness. They help make sure medicines have the right amount of active stuff. Also, they help compare different groups of patients for better treatments. In health, there are many ways to use these tools to make sure data is right. For things like counting how many people pass away, like with COVID-19, we need to be sure we're counting right. These tools help fix mistakes and make things more accurate, which is really important when dealing with people's lives.

When collecting data about growth, some people were asked just because they were easy to find. This way might not be fair to everyone in the group, making mistakes more likely. It's better to choose people from different groups to get a better mix of views: this is called "stratified sampling." But we're not sure how the data was collected exactly.

For a group of twenty people, the average was 70.4. Using a computer program, a range of values was found to be between 66.6 and 74.2, with a 95% chance of being right about the true average height in the whole group. The more sure we want to be about our guess, the wider the range of values has to be. This means we might not be exactly right, but we'll be more sure about it. Increasing the range makes it more likely to make a mistake, but it's the price we pay for being more sure about our guess.
