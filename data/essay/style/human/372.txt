The Canadian view on NATO's plan talks about important things for Canada's safety. They want to be more involved in world peace missions and keep good relationships with other NATO countries. They are smart about defense, thinking about what Canada's military and money needs are. It's hard to know how much the Syrian problem and the coronavirus affect Canada. They need to think about better ways to protect Canada. This helps both Israel and Canada and makes them closer. Canada is ready to help if Iraq asks for troops to leave. This might show Canada is kind, but we're not sure. Canada wants to trade and be friends with NATO countries, which is important for Israel. Israel has had many dangers like terrorism and nuclear threats. They didn't have a security plan until 1953. But now they are safer because they have good ties with powerful countries like the USA, China, Russia, Germany, Canada, Poland, and India. Israel is strong in the region and does well because of their old strategy.
