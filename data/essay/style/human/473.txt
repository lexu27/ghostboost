Water being dirty is a big problem everywhere, and bad chemicals that kill bugs make it worse. If the water we need to live is not clean, plants, animals, and food get sick, and some may disappear, and people can get very sick too. Rules about bad chemicals in water need to be made by the government in many countries, and groups that care about the whole world should make rules too. Also, we need to know more about how bad the water is before we tell people and leaders to fix it (Demir, Dilek, & Yetis, 2019). Every place is different, and some countries can’t make rules to stop dirty water because they can’t meet the general rules for the environment. We can use different plans to use fewer bad chemicals in places like schools, hospitals, and politics. Replacing bad chemicals with natural things can happen with help from programs and projects that teach about how bad man-made chemicals are. Also, we can do things in local areas with bad water or lots of big farms to make things better (van den Berg et al., 2020). Culture can help change how people see bad chemicals by getting money from the government for projects that protect nature. Groups that don’t make money can try to make people use fewer bad chemicals and ask for rules to stop them (Demir, Dilek, & Yetis, 2019). It’s better to ask many different people like locals, doctors, and farmers to help fix the problem than to punish businesses. We need to talk about the bad things that happen because of dirty water and decide what to do together.
