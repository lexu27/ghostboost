Songs of Song is a story about love and work between a man and woman. The Song tells us about a family and love, where lovers meet, marry, and work together. King Solomon wrote the Song and talked about hard work, joy, beauty, and family.
In the beginning, a woman tells her love for her man. She says her skin got dark from working hard in the vineyard. Her brothers made her work a lot there. Even though the Song is about love, work is also important. Back then, dark skin meant working in the sun for money, like peasants. But in this Song, the woman's beauty remains even with hard work. She says in Song 1:5, "Dark I am, yet lovely." Also, she's not sad about her job as it prepares her for her own vineyard in the future.
In many places, work is seen as not pretty. But in this Song, work is shown as beautiful. King Solomon makes a special seat and praises good work. It's like a labor of love, as in Song 3:10. The Song says work is not just for money but also for beauty.
The woman looks for her beloved man, the best of men. Her friends tell her he's working as a shepherd. His work doesn't stop them from being together. They can be a family while working, unlike today where work keeps families apart.
They both show love through the Song. He praises her beauty, and she sings of her love for him. When spring comes, they enjoy it and he invites her over. In ancient times, spring was for farming and protecting crops. The couple happily work together chasing foxes off the farms.
This kind of work is different from what God told Adam in Genesis. After Adam sinned, God made work hard. But in Song, work is shown as God wants – joyful and fulfilling. It's like in Isaiah, “They will build houses and dwell in them; they will plant vineyards and eat their fruit.” This shows that God wants people to work happily in good relationships.
The Song also talks about marriage. The woman wants the man, so she goes to him in a nice seat. He welcomes her with a crown, showing they had a beautiful wedding. After, they sing to each other. The author uses strong words to describe their wedding night. Although some avoid talking about sex, the Song says it's normal for lovers on their wedding day.
Sex in the Song connects home and work, the foundation of all economic activities. It brings kids who help in the fields. It also shows passion, keeping homes strong. Nowadays, work keeps couples apart, leading to divorce. The Song says couples shouldn't let work stop them from being close.
