Although helping in church is a new word, Christians have been doing it for a long time. Many churches do spiritual coaching and leadership without much planning. It is important to make rules and ways for mentors to help better. According to Mallison (1998), Christian coaching helps people become better Christians by teaching them well and giving them good words from God and the Bible. The writer says Christian mentoring is about having a good friendship where one person helps the other get more of God's kindness in their life and work. The main idea is that Christians need mentors to grow and care about others' progress. Christian mentoring uses spiritual things and the Bible a lot. Mallison (1998) says that Christians should focus on helping others grow since Christianity is about relationships and being together. The writer talks about how living alone as a Christian is not good. But, the writer also says that Christian mentoring won't work if the mentor doesn't really want to see the other person grow spiritually.
Helping others and caring about their spiritual growth is very important for Christians who want to grow deeper in their faith. Church groups should choose good people to mentor new Christians because they are trustworthy and truly care about the new Christians (Mallison, 1998). The book says it's very important to have a good plan for mentoring based on the Bible. This means that Christian mentors should teach others well so that they can teach others too. Some criticisms in the book include only using the Bible for information and not talking about the relationship between spiritual friends and mentors or the harm mentors can do. The author supports his ideas by comparing them to other works and using a lot of the Bible. One question from the book is how Christian mentoring can fix bad coaching.
