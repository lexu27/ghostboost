Global weather change, as new studies show, is made by people. Many start to understand how serious this is. We still can make things better. We all can work together to make change happen, even if it takes time. 

The big problem comes from how different countries make greenhouse gases. We can do little things to change this. For example, we should use buses and trains more, not cars. Cars make a lot of bad fumes in the air. Doing this can help lower gas, which helps with global warming.

Also, we should dry clothes on a line, not in a hot dryer. We can set the heater to a lower temperature too. Eating less meat and more vegetables, fruits, and grains is good too. This helps lower gas from meat farms.

To finish, global warming is very serious and affects the whole world. We need to work together to fix this problem, stop bad gases, and live healthy. By saving energy, eating right, and living well, we can help the earth a lot.
