The story in the first post makes socialism seem not good. But in real life, many things cause the problems in the government and economy. Thomas Sowell, an expert in money, says we should not blame only socialism for the issues in Venezuela and the United States.

First, Venezuela did not share its money well, so the poor people did not get much from the oil. Even in the US, which likes making money, some people have more money than others. My friend thinks we should take more money from the rich – this idea is on TV a lot too. So, sharing money is not only a socialist thing.

Next, Venezuela only relied on oil from the government. In 2006, President Chavez took control of everything, which broke the country's ability to make things. The government gave out lots of money from the oil, which made prices go up really fast. My parents worry the US might have the same problem because they make lots of money. So, socialism does not always mean a poor country.

Lastly, when some people have more money than others, it can make the poorer people feel bad. Thomas Sowell says that talking about taking money from the rich is what politicians do to get votes. This happened in the story where the teacher made the smart kids get lower grades to make the others feel better. But my friend from Sweden says they pay lots of taxes, so the government can help people. So, if everyone works hard and pays taxes, some socialist ideas can be good.

In the end, I think saying socialism is always bad is not fair. Venezuela's problems come from corruption, relying too much on oil, and not sharing money well. But even the US has these issues, even though they have many types of jobs. So, socialism is not always bad – it is people being too greedy and lazy that cause problems.
