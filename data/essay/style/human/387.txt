There are many different ways to study languages; one is the prescriptive method. This way is like rules for speaking or writing. Crystal (1987) says that prescriptivism is a view that picks one way to use a language as the standard for everyone. This way is often seen in formal talking and writing. Another way is descriptive, which looks at the real situation without rules. The supporter of this way just talks about the different ways people use language (Crystal, 1987). They watch but don't follow the official rules. 

Even though these ways are different, both can be useful in different situations. Crystal (1987) says that looking at these ways can sometimes make people see the other side in a wrong way, create unfair ideas, and lead to arguments. But both ways should be used together, taking good parts from each. The prescriptive way helps make society well-organized, while the descriptive way helps record how language changes naturally (Crystal, 1987). This helps bring together logic and how things naturally happen.

Not all changes in language are liked because people don't understand them. One big reason is thinking changes mean things are getting worse, which older people often say (Crystal, 1987). Also, some think language changes mean education quality is going down and media is having a bad influence. But the author has good reasons against these worries. Older people always find fault with change, as history shows. Problems in education and society only happen if changes come too fast.

But this doesn't happen very often, so I agree with these ideas. Crystal (1987) says it's normal for older people to not like how the world is changing, like in stories. Media influence and education quality don't always have to do with language changes directly. That's why I support this idea - people are usually scared of change. Most people like to keep doing things the same way. But language change is natural and happens with society and its most forward-thinking members.
