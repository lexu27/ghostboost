The computer things in the world today have many activities not really connected to them, like finding people for jobs. With companies growing and more people wanting jobs, a better way to pick candidates was needed, so they started to use special software to help. The article by Pardes talks about how people are learning to use the software to help them get the job they want.

The article begins with a talk with Shirin Nilizadeh, who found patterns in how the software chooses candidates. A friend of Nilizadeh worried that her job applications weren't good enough, so Nilizadeh tried adding different words to make them better. Even though Nilizadeh was just curious, many websites give tips on how to improve resumes, like adding hidden words. There are many ways to make your application better, from mentioning top schools to copying details from job ads.

Later in the article, it says that using too much technology in hiring can lead to unfairness. Joseph Fuller says that too much AI in hiring can make it unfair for some people. Without using the right words or skills on their resumes, many job seekers might not get a chance. Julie Schweber says that software rejects many applicants who don't match the job requirements. Some companies also sell services to make resumes look better, making it easier for rich applicants to get ahead.

Looking at the article shows that technology can be cold. While tech can make work faster, it can also make it hard for people who aren't good with tech. Relying too much on tech can lead to problems being used for bad things. Even though tech seems fair, it can still lead to unfair outcomes like favoritism, cheating, and bribes.

I chose this article because it shows how tech can be used badly in the world today. It was interesting to see how small differences between humans and machines can affect how they read text. Learning more about hiring processes can help me avoid problems in my future IT job.
