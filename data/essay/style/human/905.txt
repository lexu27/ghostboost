Scott Kiesling talks about the word dude in the article Dude (2004). He shows how dude is used, what it means, and what it does. He is an American language expert who likes to study how dudes are used in American culture because he likes gender and language. Dude is used a lot and is popular because of how it is used in society.
Dude is mostly used by young European American men when they talk to each other, and sometimes by women too. Kiesling (2004) says that men mostly say dude to other men, but sometimes young women say it too. Context and grammar decide how dude is used, like how it sounds when you say it. So, things like gender and where you are from affect how much dude is used.
Dude has five jobs when people use it, and they show how it is connected to male friendship. These jobs are agreeing with someone, showing closeness and friendship, organizing a talk, calming down a fight, and showing surprise (Kiesling, 2004). Dude can do more than one job at a time or be unclear, so these jobs are not separate. Dude helps to create different feelings, like the ones mentioned earlier.
Dude became popular in the 1980s when young people used it to show they liked something. So, dude became a word for friends to show they were together, as told by history (Kiesling, 2004). The meaning of togetherness and friendship still sticks with dude today, and these meanings are important when people use the word. The fast rise of dude could be because of a return to valuing family and hard work, with people sticking together.
How dude is used is decided by what it does and how it fits into a talk, and this helped it become common in Anglo-American society. Young European American men use dude more than young women. Also, dude does five jobs at once and has many meanings when people talk. Dude shows a strong image of being masculine, which helped it become popular. Dude is like a memory of the past that stays with each new generation.
