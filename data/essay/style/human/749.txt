Introduction
This picture was made by Cindy Sherman and is from a collection about female movie characters. It was chosen because it tells us about black-and-white pictures and why they are interesting (Public Delivery, 2021). The reason it's good to analyze is that it helps us understand cinema culture by looking at one picture about how people look at things (“COMS3410 week three,” n.d.).

The picture we're talking about is called “Untitled Film Still #21,” made in 1978, and can be seen online at MoMA Learning (Sherman, n.d.). By studying this picture, we can see how important culture is and how images are used to send messages.

Visual Description
This black-and-white photo seems simple at first, but when we look closer, we see more meaning. We notice a woman looking sad and avoiding the camera (Sherman, n.d.). This is a common thing in Sherman’s collection, and it's seen in this picture too (Public Delivery, 2021). In the background, there are buildings that look like they are in a city center, showing us that many people face similar struggles. Even though we don’t know exactly what the woman is dealing with, we can guess it has to do with how women were seen in society (Public Delivery, 2021).

The details in the photo, like the way it's made and the social issues it talks about, help us understand the message better. The colors and the distance between the woman and the buildings show us how she might feel isolated (Public Delivery, 2021). This picture combines simple things with complex issues that were common for women in the past.

Compositional Analysis
Compositional Modality
Looking at how the picture is put together is very important to understand its message. The type of photography used, black-and-white, helps us see things from the past (“COMS3410 week two,” n.d.; Sherman, n.d.). This style is better for showing historical situations than modern techniques (“COMS3410 week 4,” n.d.). The way the picture is arranged stays the same and shows a biased view of women (Public Delivery, 2021).

The composition and details in the picture help us see the photographer’s concerns clearly without distractions. This picture reflects the common idea of how women were seen as attractive no matter what (Public Delivery, 2021). This way of thinking was common in the past, and this picture shows it accurately (Sherman, n.d.). Changing the context of the picture wouldn’t change its message much.

Gaze and Tishman’s Approach: Significance for Interpretation
Another important thing to think about is how the male perspective affects how we see the picture. Hollywood movies often show women in a way that pleases men (“COMS3410 week three,” n.d.). The woman in this picture is like others in the collection, fitting into this idea (Sherman, n.d.). The details in the picture show how makeup and femininity were linked to women's roles in the past (Public Delivery, 2021). This picture follows the same standards as others in the collection, criticizing how women were seen in the past.

Details in the picture help us see it as something from the past. The way colors and shapes are used tells us it’s meant to show history (“COMS3410 week two,” n.d.). The separation between the woman and the world behind her shows how she might feel isolated (“COMS3410 week two,” n.d.). These details support the importance of what we discussed before.

Connection to Visual Themes and Larger Ideas
The way the picture is made connects to bigger ideas shown visually. The link between the woman’s face and the importance of makeup for women’s roles in society is clear (Public Delivery, n.d.). This picture shows social ideas from the past clearly (“COMS3410 week 5,” n.d.). It also talks about public problems with how women were expected to behave (Public Delivery, n.d.; “COMS3410 week 6,” n.d.). Changing anything in this picture would change its message a lot. The ideas in this picture only make sense in a historical context.

Conclusion
In conclusion, this picture by Cindy Sherman shows us social and historical themes. It's not just a simple picture but has deep meaning. The way it’s put together helps us see women’s struggles in the past, focusing on their attractiveness. The male perspective is clear in the picture, criticizing how women were seen. The simple details in the picture help us understand its message about society and history.
