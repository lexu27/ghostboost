Aristotle finded very important things for all logic with variables. He say logic not only for some things or words but for laws like modus ponens or modus tollens with variables. Logic look at different judgments and take out common things between them. Syllogism is from Aristotle and the most important in his logic. He talk about syllogism types, working and not working ones, and three syllogism figures. Aristotle start to research reasoning methods first. Other people before just try to understand methods and principles separately. Modus ponens and modus tollens give foundation for truth in thinking. I think Aristotle did great job with conclusions that follow rules, contradiction laws, and no third thing.
Nowadays, logic come from philosophy and math. Modern logic is very advanced but not so philosophical - more technical. It called mathematical logic to show new methods. It not so interesting for talking about because it focus on exact sciences and computers, no confusion. Modern logic use artificial language and intelligence, which is not as exciting as old ideas.
