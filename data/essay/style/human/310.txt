The effect of a religious care view on the suggested money plan
The religious view on care thinks that leaders are given power over people and things by God (Carradus, Zozimo, & Discua Cruz, 2020). So, they should try to keep everyone good to make God happy. This money plan was made to help everyone involved, like doctors taking care of big patients and advice team.
The empty parts and unknowns in the money plan for the project
Even though the money plan looks like it covers most of the costs for the project, there are still some things we don't know. Oâ€™Connell (2020) says that leaders should always think about the worst thing that can happen and be ready for it. For this project, first, we don't know how many doctors will need mental care. This makes it hard to know how many mental health workers we need. Also, things like big problems and prices going up may mean we need more money for stuff like computers and medicine. And the costs for services, teaching, and fixing may go up too.
Guesses that can help with the empty parts in the money plan for the project
For the first problem with the money plan, we can guess that there will be a normal need for mental care among doctors. This guess can help a bit with the risk of not knowing how many services will be needed. If the expected need is low but the real need is high, then people won't get enough help. But if the expected need is high and the real need is low, that's a big money loss. For prices going up, we need to guess some extra money for surprises. So even if prices go up, we still have enough money for the plan.
