1929 stock market crash was very bad for United States. Stock prices went down a lot. People thought they could make a lot of money by buying and selling stocks. But too many people borrowed money to buy stocks. This made the money system very weak. Other problems like low wages, bad farming, and too many loans made the crash worse. Many people lost their jobs. Some people lost all their money. This made banks lose lots of money too. People couldn't pay back their loans. This made the Great Depression happen. Many people had no homes or jobs. Some people killed themselves because their businesses failed. Life was very hard with little money and too much work.
