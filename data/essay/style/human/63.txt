The Theodor Adorno idea about industry culture meant a strong link between money society and the things money makes in the culture world to make better the social ways that help money grow more. So, Adorno said that most media things like movies, books, TV shows make people believe in money values. On the other side, the structural functionalism theory looks at society like a living thing where each part does its job to keep the whole thing alive. So, even if they both care about society being stable, they are different when you apply them to today's culture and society.

In his idea, Adorno talked about how most media things like movies and books show that having money makes you happy. But, a better example that shows how it supports money is kids' entertainment. From very young, kids watch TV shows, cartoons, and movies. In the structural functionalism idea, kids’ entertainment helps them learn and grow emotionally. It teaches them to be kind and polite, which is important for the future. But in the industry culture idea, kids’ entertainment is all about selling things related to the characters in the movies. For example, Disney, a big company, made a plan to use cartoon characters to bring kids to their theme parks. They release movies and products at the same time to make more money.
