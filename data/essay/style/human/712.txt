The big rocks and music shows were shown on TV and became liked by many young people. Three main ones were Where the Action Is on CBS, Shinding on ABC, and Hullabaloo on NBC. More houses got TVs and many different kinds of shows, like music shows, were on TV. The bands on these shows became very famous. The TV shows helped show the new kind of young people's music culture and helped make stars in music and TV. Some bands, like the Monkees, were made for TV first, not music, but their music became very popular. The Monkees were made more for TV shows than for real music like The Beatles, who focused more on their music. 
TV changed the music world a lot. Some people liked the pop and performance music on TV, while others, usually older, liked rock music on the radio more. TV also made fake bands, like the Archies, a cartoon band liked by young people. This was new and made a new kind of music and TV fun. But before cable TV like MTV, 1960s TV had limits. TV had bad sound and picture quality compared to recording and radio, which got better. TV is not made for good sound, so young fans cared more about the TV look than good sound.
