Social Media Examinerâ€™s video on social media ideas was very helpful to me. It showed more than twenty ideas for posts to help any business with marketing. This source shows that social media, like Facebook Business and Instagram, is very powerful and helps with marketing by sharing posts, stories, hashtags, and content from users. The best part for me was learning about trends, advantages and disadvantages, comparing, giving direct offers, and creating long posts.

Good leadership is important when a company wants to use social media. A good leader communicates well, like writing on social media. For instance, a leader might ask customers to make content by using a hashtag, such as #MyInstagramLogo, and to share their thoughts on the logo or any other product or service the company has. Leaders need to explain their vision clearly and make sure everyone understands. They should guide their employees in the right way and motivate them to make changes.

I might face some ethical problems, like promising too much, not delivering enough, and saying things that are too extreme. I will try to give customers honest information about the business and stop trying to make everyone happy to deal with the first issue. Promising too much can make customers unhappy and they might give negative feedback. So, it's better to follow ethical rules and only make promises that can be kept completely. To deal with the second issue, I will try to be open and truthful about the content. If the company says it can deliver products from one country to another in three days, it must do it. Otherwise, it will be lying to customers, which will hurt its reputation. These plans will help me with the ethical issues because being honest and clear is always important. It helps bring in new customers and keeps old customers who trust the company.
