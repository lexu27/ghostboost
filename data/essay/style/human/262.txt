In the last few years, doctors have started to focus more on patients and their needs before they get sick. This is good, but many hospitals still have problems with money and organization, so they can't do this kind of care all the time. Some studies show that taking care of people before they get sick can save money in the long run. For example, one study says that doing more cancer tests early can help to spend less money later on medical care. Another study found that taking care of people before they get sick can lower costs for visits and medicine. But even with this proof, some health systems don't pay attention to these good ideas. 
I think the reason for this is because many times, patients make their own choices about their health and don't want to use new technology to help prevent sickness. I remember one patient I had who is an older man with a health insurance from the government. He smokes a lot and drinks alcohol, which can make his diabetes worse. He often needs to go to the hospital because his blood sugar gets too high and he faints. He stays in the hospital for a few days every few months. Since we know why he keeps getting sick, we need to think about how to stop it from happening in the first place. 
One way to help patients like him is to use technology to remind them to take care of themselves. This man doesn't always remember to check his health, so we can use apps on his phone to help him keep track of his diabetes. These types of apps have been shown to help people with diabetes feel better. Getting these devices and apps for the hospital can save money in the long run because fewer people will need to stay in the hospital or go back after they leave. So, it's important for everyone to see technology as a good way to help people stay healthy and not just as something new and fancy.
