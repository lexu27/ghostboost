Arguably, profit and cash flow are not the same. Profit is what is left after paying all expenses. Cash flow is money coming in and going out of the business. Cash flow helps to show how much money is there to use. Profit is seen after all the money is counted. It is important for a company to know about both profit and cash flow. This helps the manager to see if the company can pay for things. Profit shows good money returns. Cash flow shows good business actions.
