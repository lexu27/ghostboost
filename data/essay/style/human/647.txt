I choose Gardens by the Bay because it is special and Singapore is very smart for making a city in a garden. The buildings show how nature and city can be together, good for future generations (PMP, 2022). They look nice and made me want to find out more about who made them. Before class, I knew about Gardens by the Bay, but only where it is and its awards.

Who Made the Gardens
Two firms, Wilkinson Eyre Architects and Grant Associates, made Gardens by the Bay. The tall trees look like drinks at night. Andrew Grant, the main designer, got ideas from Australia and big trees (PMP, 2022). Singapore’s national flower, the orchid, also influenced the design. The plan shows pretty flowers and how to manage water, energy, and trash. Singapore wanted a garden city to make life better with lots of flowers.

What Gardens by the Bay Is
It is a big garden and many people visit. The garden is about plants and art, a new way to see plants. It mixes nature and city life well (Gardens by the Bay, 2022). It is fun and teaches about plants that many don’t see often. There are plants from cool places, warm places, and forests. It is the world’s biggest garden with tall trees.

What I Think
Gardens by the Bay is special and helps the planet. The tall trees work like plants and save water. They also show rare plants to people. It is good for money and nature. It helps save plants and makes kids like plants. People can see green places far away in this garden.

What I Learn from the Buildings
Gardens by the Bay in Singapore is cool. The buildings are good for nature and city. I like how they save water and power, and use plants well (BBC Travel, 2022). They show we can build things like nature to save the Earth.

About the Design
Balance
The tall trees are balanced with round columns. The Bay Gardens are also balanced, even without columns (Vinnitskaya, 2011).

Difference
There is no big difference in the buildings. Tall trees look like flowers, Bay Gardens look like leaves. But the white baby is different, not like the others (Vinnitskaya, 2011).

Pattern and Repeat
The buildings look the same inside and out. Tall trees are cone-shaped, like drinks. There are 18 tall trees that look the same.

Rhythm
The tall trees have a good rhythm and light up at night. They make the garden pretty. They look like a forest with bright flowers (Vinnitskaya, 2011).

Same and Not Same
Bay Gardens are not the same on both sides, but tall trees are. Tall trees are big and small, like a forest with tall and short trees.

Big and Small
The buildings are very tall, one has the second tallest waterfall. The big rooms look like wide open spaces, not small rooms.
