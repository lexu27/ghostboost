Gustave Moreau is a famous artist who liked to tell old stories in his paintings. One picture he made is called Jupiter and Semele. It was painted in 1985 in France. The story in the painting comes from Ancient Greece, then the Romans also liked it. The main characters are Jupiter, the powerful god, and Semele, a regular woman. Jupiter loved Semele and she got pregnant. But Jupiter's wife, Juno, made a plan to trick Semele. She asked Jupiter to show his true self to Semele, which made her die because humans can't see gods' real forms. Semele died, and her baby was taken out of her body. Moreau's painting shows this sad story and talks about how humans are different from gods by showing Jupiter and Semele between heaven and the underworld.

The painting might look fancy because of all the details. The big figure in the middle is Jupiter with bright thunders over his head. He sits on a fancy chair with Eastern decorations and pretty plants, holding scared Semele who looks like a statue. Above Jupiter, there are tall columns reaching the sky, and below there are many gods and strange creatures. Next to Jupiter's chair, there is an eagle, two fighting women, and a deer. Even though the painting looks balanced, it's hard to see the main things because of all the details.

Jupiter's huge body and face are the most important parts. He wears lots of jewelry and symbols from different cultures, like a flower from India and a beetle from Egypt. These things show how powerful Jupiter is, like Eastern kings and Egyptian pharaohs. His strong look at the viewer shows his power. Semele stands out because of her light skin and dress. She is almost naked, symbolizing how powerless humans are in front of gods. The baby Dionysus, born from Semele, is often compared to Jesus. Semele's meeting with Jupiter shows how impossible it is for humans to understand gods.

Three other figures in the painting are important too: a woman with a sword, Pan with hooves, and a woman in pain. They show how humans feel and live. The painting also shows the upper world with angels and the lower part with scary things like witches. These parts connect the gods' world with humans'. Another theme in the painting is rebirth, shown by Semele's death and Dionysus's birth. This means that even though gods and humans are different, they are still connected. In the end, Moreau's painting about Jupiter and Semele is full of symbols showing the difference between humans and gods, with a mix of Christian and Eastern ideas.
