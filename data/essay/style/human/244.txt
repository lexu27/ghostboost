The big court said Static Control was right about the Lanham Act and their ad lies. They had to see what the rule meant by looking at old ways of reading laws. Another problem was calling Static Control's claim a standing question, which was not true. Lexmark argued using a different case but the main focus was on what the law said.
Breaking the law hurt Static Control's name because it was covered by the law. The court thought the law only helps those it's meant to. The law talks about protecting people and being fair. If a business lies or hurts another, that's bad. The hurt business has to show it lost money because of the lie.
The court said only the hurt person from the law-breaking can sue. If the harm is too far from the bad act, they can't sue. Since only business harm is allowed by the law, the harm from tricking customers is not enough.
The rules are more like tips than strict tests. The big court said Static Control can sue under the law. They can say they lost money and got a bad name because of Lexmark's lies.
