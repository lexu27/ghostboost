Subsidize programs are like help from government for poor people. They give things like food, home, and learning to people who need help. The aim is to help people get good services and save money for themselves. Some people think that getting help might make others not want to work.
A good example is help for houses called House Vouchers and Public Housing. This is for people who are poor or have trouble moving. With this, people who have less money and those who can't move easily can live in houses that are not too expensive. Some say that getting help might make people want to find work. Most jobs are in big cities. If there is help for living in cities that is not too costly, people might try to find jobs there. When they can save money from their job, it makes them want to work more.
After COVID-19, I think help programs are important for people and the country. The virus made it hard for countries to trade, and many people became very poor. Besides helping poor people live better, help can also help businesses start again and make more money, which helps the country's economy. To sum up, help programs are very important for a country because they help people with less money and make it easy for businesses to grow.
