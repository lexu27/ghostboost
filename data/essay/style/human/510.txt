Financial statement tools are very important. They help us understand how a company is doing. There are different types of tools like ratio, vertical, and horizontal analysis. This part will talk about the good and bad things about these tools. Ratio analysis is good for checking how well a company is working and how they use money. But, it only works well if the other company is the same size and type. It also only looks at old data, not new data. Vertical analysis is good for comparing the money of one company to another. But, it doesn't show if a company has enough money. Horizontal analysis helps us see how a company is growing and spending money. But, it's not always good because the rules keep changing. Financial statement analysis helps companies plan money and manage things like cash, debts, and budgets. Different tools are used to get information about a company's money, growth, and how they compare to others.
