I watch two videos about finding job, one about how to talk about money when want more salary and other about showing who you are for work. From first video, I know must say why worth more money and how special you are, like in the second video about showing your good sides when looking for job. Also, good to know how to be flexible in discussions to make everyone happy.
Second video talks more about showing your true self to employer, so they know if you will be happy working there. Being honest is key to show you are right for the job and can do it well.
Important skills are making value, talking about money, being flexible, and being honest. These are good to show bosses you are good for the job. Also important for being a manager because you need to know how to show yourself well. These skills are needed for people who work with others and know their importance.
