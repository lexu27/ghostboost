In the first part of the reading, many things decide what makes people happy. The book says that making choices and doing things about certain topics can bring happiness. For instance, if someone builds a house, they will feel happy. Also, feeling healthy shows a good side. The writer wants to show that people can find happiness in everything connected to them. People pick things that make them happy, like money, music, and more. 

Goodness is based on being self-sufficient. This means living within limits. Goodness can be passed from one person to another, like from parents to kids or friends to friends. The book talks about how humans are part of political, social, and economic settings that help achieve common good. Happiness is linked to how people feel about their bodies and how they live. How people connect with the environment can also be part of goodness. What is said in important situations reflects human completeness. 

The idea of goodness can be shown by what one has and what one lacks. Satisfaction with daily things like rain or relationships shows goodness. The example of a carpenter shows the importance of following logic even if it's not what one wants. These factors limit people and show important restrictions in life.
