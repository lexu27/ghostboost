Both looking at people and changing how the body looks are connected to not good and not real beauty ideas in society today. But, they are different in how they show up and what happens because of them. Looking at people is just thinking someone doesn't look pretty like most people think. It's about saying bad things about people who don't fit the usual idea of beauty and is focused on people outside of the one doing it. Changing the body a lot is when someone changes how they look to be different from what society thinks is normal (Good, 2016). To show the difference between these, one is about not looking nice, while the other is about changing oneself in ways that others see as not normal or not following what society says is right.

The ways these two things are different come from looking at them from outside or inside, even though both are about not being happy with how you look. Maybe someone who looks at others is very unsure about how pretty they are, so they judge others. Being too focused on how others look or take care of themselves usually means not feeling good about how you look, even if it's not as easy to see as body changes (Good, 2016). On the other hand, these changes can happen because someone wants to, or because the society or people around them want it. Like in the past in China, where women had their feet tied to make them small and like a rose. Usually, the pressure to make big changes to the body is put on women, who are expected to follow them in some places to keep their honor and be seen as valuable for marriage.
