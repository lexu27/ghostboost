Robotics is about making robots. Robots help people. To make a robot, we need to test it. We check if it works well. A robot does tasks by following instructions from a computer. Robots can look like people or do specific jobs. Some robots can think on their own. When making a robot, we have to plan different steps. First, we decide what the robot will do. Then, we choose how it will work - like in a factory or with smart features. Next, we make the main control part and build the body. The course for robots is to see if they can move, find things, and overcome obstacles. To do this, we set up a fake world for the robot to go through. We test how well it can avoid problems and solve them. We also look at how it does in a test with a score. Robots have parts like a body, wheels, and a brain to run programs. They also have sensors to see things around them. The course should be challenging for the robot to move around. It needs to communicate well too. We make the robot go through different tasks to see how it reacts. This helps us know if it can make quick decisions. We also change where it starts from to see if it can adapt. Lastly, we check how fast it can go without failing. In the end, robots are machines that do tasks on their own. The course helps them learn to move around and deal with obstacles. A fake world test is a good way to see if simple robots can be independent. The robot's parts include its body, wheels, brain, and processor to run programs. The course should have challenges for the robot to move through.
