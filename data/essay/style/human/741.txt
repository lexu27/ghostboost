Sex trafficking is a big problem in the world. It is not noticed enough. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime in 2009 said that most human slavery is because of sex exploitation, around 79%. I think this crime happens because people are too greedy, the media doesn’t talk about it much, and the government doesn’t pay attention to it. Also, many people want sex, but they want it in a way that is not okay. They want it cheap, so this makes sex slavery happen.

But, what’s more important is that the government and other big groups don’t care much about this problem. This means that many people don’t know how to see if someone is a sex trafficker. Some people think that most prostitutes choose to sell their bodies because they can’t find other work, use drugs, or have other problems. But, new studies show that this is not true most of the time. For a long time, people blamed women for selling their bodies, not the men who make them do it.

Some men who pay for sex don’t know they are supporting a crime. Some people know they are having sex with young girls or women who are forced to do it, and they should be punished like the traffickers. I think the first group can still be blamed because they see prostitutes as objects, not people. This means they can’t feel sorry for these women.

To fix this problem, the government should teach women how to avoid being taken and watched. Also, the government should control some places where people have sex and check on them a lot. Lastly, the U.S. should help stop sex trafficking in poor countries and get other countries to help too. I think only when all countries work together can we stop sex trafficking.
