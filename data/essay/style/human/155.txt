In building making, Code of Practice means a special group of rules and ways to follow to handle possible bad effects on nature from building works. For big customers, city councils, and groups for people, it is used for new projects and tells what needs to be done about how building affects things. It aims to give advice in the rules of law, office work, and tech systems to keep workers, nature, and people safe and manage big dangerous places. By keeping far from big city areas like homes, shops, schools, and hospitals and big dangerous places and making plans for emergencies, big accidents at these places won't happen. Code of Practice is used for big dangerous places that are picked from a list of bad stuff with set amounts. They need quick care as they might cause very bad events that harm nature and people. So, big dangerous places are oil making places, chemical and oil factories, storing of fire stuff, gas, and gas in liquid form, places making plant food, places storing chemicals, and places cleaning water with chlorine. Dangers from nuclear stuff, army dangers, and moving chemicals that are unsafe are not in the code as they need different ways to control and manage. In general, the code has a list of jobs for groups who know what to do to stop bad events with big dangerous places. These groups are the law checkers, safety groups, police, city groups, workers and their leaders, factory bosses, fire and health groups, sellers of big danger tech, and other groups involved.
