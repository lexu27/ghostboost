The making of countries is not easy. It has many steps, including cultural ways of being strong. People think that this is very important because people who do things in society have a big role in making alliances and being in charge. Knowing this idea can help understand how Western Europe, China, the Islamic World, and India were made.

To start, we must know what a social way of being powerful is and why it matters. It is seen as a special area where people who make mass media have a lot of influence on culture and can make changes in society. These things can shape what people think, which might affect how countries are made. Gledhill says the main difference between places with a government and those without one is how power is organized. So, not sharing power can lead to unfairness, and not having the same rights can be linked to not having a central power and the opposite is linked to fairness.

In the end, to understand how countries started in Western Europe, China, the Islamic World, and India, we need to think about cultural ways of being powerful. The writer tries to move away from the common European ideas and thoughts on the role of social studies and things that affect them in Chapter 3. Besides other reasons like politics and money, how society affects things is very important. People who do things in society shape what people think and help form opinions. This shows how the making of countries in Europe, China, the Islamic World, and India is connected to how power is handled in society.
