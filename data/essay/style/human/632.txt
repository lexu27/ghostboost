The ecology of literature is like humanities because a person's thoughts affect everything they do. Some people disagree and think that each person's thoughts should be personal and not affect choices made in public. To understand literature, a reader must first try to understand the writer's thoughts because knowing the author will help them understand the main idea of the writing. A person's experiences shape their thoughts, and knowing the writer and the world around them can help understand literature. Therefore, humanities and literature help show the author's values and beliefs, which makes it easier to understand the writer's work and its supposed impact.
