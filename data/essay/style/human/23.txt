Portraying the lives of gods and how they act with humans, the books "Iliad" and "Metamorphosis" talk about how some people with power are not nice. In "Iliad," Agamemnon gets in trouble for being mean: "be ready, that I be not left,/Alone of all the Greeks, without my prize" (Homer, 762 B. C.). Also, in "Metamorphosis," powerful gods don't care about less powerful ones: "What had escaped the waves, now feared the flame" (Ovid, 8 B.C.). But, unlike "Iliad," "Metamorphosis" doesn't show much punishment for the gods ignoring what humans need (Homer, 762 B. C.; Ovid, 8 B. C.). So, even though they are similar in meaning, "Iliad" and "Metamorphosis" have different views on power abuse.

The idea of protecting humans, important in "Iliad" and "Metamorphosis," is still relevant today. Nowadays, many leaders have a lot of power because of politics or money (Homer, 762 B. C.; Ovid, 8 B. C.). For example, in places like China where leaders are seen almost like gods, human rights are ignored, similar to what happens in "Iliad" and "Metamorphosis." But, "Metamorphosis" is less effective because it makes fun of how mortals are treated. On the other hand, "Iliad," being more serious, shows how bad it is when powerful gods hurt humans, which fits better with today's idea of power abuse. Still, both "Iliad" and "Metamorphosis" have important messages. They tell us about power in Ancient Greek society and help us see similar things happening now.
