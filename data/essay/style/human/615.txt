The ship we choose is related to how much money we need to move it. Stopford (2009) says picking new ships is good to spend less money because they need fewer people, less fixing, and work better. But new ships aren't always the best for saving money on shipping. Right now, most cargo ships worldwide are more than 14 years old, making it hard to get new ships (Cheng, 2021). When there's a lot of demand, prices go up, like in 2021 and 2016 (Cheng, 2021). These times saw more people wanting the old ships.
Usually, using older ships to move things costs less. This happens because buying an old ship is cheaper, so there's less rush to pay back money (Ros Chaos et al., 2021). Companies with old ships know they're not perfect, so they offer better prices to make up for it. Also, old ships can use cheaper fuel, which helps cut costs (Ros Chaos et al., 2021). Even though old ships need more fixing than new ones, the fixing isn't as expensive. New ships have fancy and delicate stuff that needs a lot of time and money to fix and change (Ros Chaos et al., 2021). Old ships are simpler and cheaper to maintain.
Overall, with most of the world's goods moved by old ships, Stopford's idea that new ships are better doesn't really work. While it seems clear that new ships are better on paper, in real life, companies have to deal with changing prices (higher for new ships), what's available, and many other things. If shipping happens a lot and can't be late, the company might have to use an old ship, not the best one.
