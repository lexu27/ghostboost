I choose Erykah Badu’s song "Bag Lady" and look at the first version, a live show, a cover by Nao in 2018, the singer’s talk, and Erica Swift’s thoughts about it. The original one shows the song as art only, so the message is all that matters ("Bag Lady (Official Video)"). The live one shows the singer in a good way ("Erykah Badu Live – Bag Lady"). But the cover version puts it in the neo-soul world. Since Nao starts with words, the focus might move from the message to Erykah Badu’s role in neo-soul ("Bag Lady – NAO Cover for the Soul Train Awards"). Nao's cover uses new recording stuff that, to me, makes the song more emotional by highlighting the singer's voice skills. So, technology changes how we see "Bag Lady." This new info adds to what I knew about the song. I see that young neo-soul singers might see this work as the heart of the genre's beauty.  
Studying the song also changed what I thought it meant and showed me that people see it in different ways. The singer says it's about "personal growth" and having too many worries (HIP Online). But others think it's about moving on in life and healing after hard times. For example, Swift says you can't move forward in life if you carry too much baggage, thinking of it as old pains. These ideas are different from what I thought before. To me, the song talks about how doing too much and not taking care of yourself leads to feeling tired and alone.
