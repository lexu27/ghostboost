Now people live in a time with fast news and new technology growing quickly; many machines are coming into everyone's daily life. News machines, especially the Internet, are everywhere around people and are almost unseen. One new idea is the Internet of Things (IoT). IoT means a group of real things with included technology that let them talk with the outside world, send news about their condition, and get news from outside.

Internet of Things means linking machines together and letting them gather and study news. It includes dealing with news and sending it to other machines through programs, apps, or tech devices. IoT machines work on their own without needing people to use computers. Still, people can change these machines or give access to news. IoT systems work live and usually have some "smart" machines and cloud platforms. Machines are joined to the cloud using WiFi, Bluetooth, or other ways to talk.

IoT might not be seen, but it is important in daily life and is put into many parts of what people do. Using IoT is not stopped by anything: the tech is used in smart houses and cars, in health care, in farming and plants. So, cooling systems, video cameras, heart pacemakers, pet chips, or field monitors are examples of a "thing". IoT wants to make better, make more effective, get needed news live for later study to make special changes. These techs make life simpler, do things automatically and quickly, and lower the need for human talk.

However, IoT has some safety and secret issues, and smart machines can easily be hurt. Such machines gather a lot of personal news from users, like ages and names, homes and phone numbers. Some have news from users' social networks. Smart machines like smart watches or bands can often make payments, so they have people's payment news. All this news is secret and needs to be safe; still, IoT machines are often broken into, and people's secret news might be taken.
