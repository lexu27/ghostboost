Topic talks about how doctors and nurses do things different when they take care of patients. Doctors look at the bodyâ€™s condition, while nurses also think about how patients feel. This helps to show the clear difference between them when they use PICOT. Doctors do research in a way that is more about numbers and facts, which is called quantitative. But nurses use a mix of opinions and data in their research. 

This topic is about how nursing and medical care are different in how they find out what is wrong with patients. The main thing they talk about is using PICOT to look at lab results or just the symptoms to make a diagnosis. The study can show how accurate the results are and compare the two ideas. It is important to see that both ways might give similar results based on how the research is done.

A study on how nurses can prevent certain injuries and give more personalized care can show why making decisions is key in this field. Decision-making is very important in nursing care. So, asking a PICOT question about providing special care to avoid falls instead of just treating them can show how nursing can be more personal.
