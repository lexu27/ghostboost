Sterile things for sick people need good cleaning and a nice place. The cleaning place is called central processing. It helps keep patients safe from bad stuff and also helps workers stay safe. There are big and small cleaning places. Some are very big and clean lots of things, others are small and just clean a few things (Swanson 245). Sometimes, cleaning happens close to where things are used, other times it happens far away. But the way things are cleaned is always the same.

If someone is making a kitchen, the plan is important. Maybe put the dishwasher near the sink for easy loading or have a trash can where food is prepared. Good design is key. The place where they clean surgical tools every day needs to follow rules from groups like AAMI, APON, and ASQ (Neue). You need a clean place for tools whether you work in a big hospital or a small clinic. Where you put the cleaning place is important for good work.

Before making a cleaning place, learn about the rules from AAMI and AORN. They help with things like how the room looks and how much light and water it needs. The room should have separate areas for dirty, clean, and super clean tools, no matter how big it is (See fig. 1). Having a plan that is easy to follow is helpful.

Cleaning things goes from dirty to clean. Moving things from dirty to clean needs a one-way system. This helps stop bad stuff from spreading. Air systems help keep the air clean. Dirty places have air going out, clean places have air going in. Cleaning tools can be tricky, even if it looks easy at first. Keeping dirty and clean things apart, having good air, and the right tools are all important in a cleaning room. The goal is to support patient and worker safety (Damien, 229).

Things that can be used again need to be cleaned or made super clean. Some things need high-level cleaning or super cleaning. A "super" clean thing has no germs left on it (Ninomura). It is only super clean if it meets all the rules for being super clean. Clean things need to be kept safe from germs. A test checks if they are still super clean.

Cleaning removes germs left on tools. Dirty tools can't be super cleaned properly. After cleaning, tools are disinfected to be safe to touch. Tools are checked, packed, then super cleaned without touching and dried before storing (see fig.2).

To understand changes in cleaning places, know their history. In the past, tools were cleaned quickly for immediate use. But this caused problems. Now, a new way called Immediate Use Steam Sterilization is used. Tools are cleaned and made super clean quickly for use. The design of cleaning places is important for good work.

To make sure cleaning places are good, experts look at them. They want to make sure workers follow rules for cleaning tools carefully. A good cleaning place has two rooms: one for cleaning and one for working with super clean tools. The rooms are separated for safety (Paul,48). The rooms need specific things like sinks and counters to clean tools safely. A single room for cleaning tools is not the best design.

Cleaning is important to keep workers safe. Dirty tools should not be handled without protection. Only some things need to be soaked or cleaned right away. The detergent used should be safe for the tools. There are different tools for cleaning, like washers and ultrasonic cleaners. Tools should be checked after cleaning.

After cleaning, tools that need super cleaning should be packed following rules. Tools should be opened, disassembled, and cleaned as the manufacturer says. Different materials can be used to pack tools. The packaging should keep tools clean and sterile. Workers should follow instructions when packing tools.

Super clean tools need to be exposed to the cleaning agent. Steam should reach all parts of the tools during cleaning. Different materials have different storage times. Tools should be stored properly to keep them sterile. Plastic covers can help keep tools clean for longer. If tools are damaged or wet, they should not be used.

In summary, cleaning tools has always been important. But as more tools need cleaning, the way they are cleaned has changed. The changes show that good design for cleaning places is important no matter where they are located.
