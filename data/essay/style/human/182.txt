Modification of computers needed better hardware and software. Buses, which are like roads inside computers, have improved a lot. There are three types of buses: address, control, and data. The data bus helps the CPU talk to other parts of the computer. The address bus helps the CPU find things in the memory, and the control bus manages how data is processed. Data buses come in different sizes like 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64. These numbers show how much data can be moved at once, with bigger numbers moving more information. 

The number of lines in a processor decides how much information can move between parts of the computer. Common computer systems use 32 or 64-bit microprocessors. A 32-bit data bus has 32 lines, while a 64-bit data bus has 64 lines, moving data faster. The main difference between these buses is how fast they can work. Older versions work at different speeds depending on the number of wires between the CPU and other parts. Even though all buses move data, they do it at different speeds because they are built differently.
