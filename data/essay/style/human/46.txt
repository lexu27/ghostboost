A business works to make money. But sometimes, spending too much money can cause problems. This can happen when the boss doesn't work hard or spends money on things that don't help the company. Then, other workers may not get as much money. So, businesses need to think about doing the right thing.

Businesses need to think about how their goals affect everyone. People who use, invest, or work for companies know what companies can do. Companies should not only make money but also help society and support their employees. They should do things to make society better, not worse.

For example, Wells Fargo, a big bank, did something wrong. They made credit cards for customers without telling them. They got in trouble and had to pay money. Nike, on the other hand, tries to do good things. They work on being more environmentally friendly and take care of their forests. Even though it costs more money, Nike still makes a lot of money and keeps a good reputation.

Many companies now focus on doing the right thing. Following good rules helps companies do well economically and socially. Corporate social responsibility is important for competition and shows that a company behaves ethically. It involves considering the environment, economy, and society for long-term success.
