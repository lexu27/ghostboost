Athens and Sparta were two big cities in old Greece. They were same but different. Both had groups that made decisions, chosen by the people. But, Sparta had two kings and was mostly about the army, while Athens had leaders chosen each year and was a democracy. They both had slaves, with Sparta having helots and Athens having many slaves. Some say both liked war. Sparta trained boys for battle, but Athens had a strong army and navy too, and they fought to control things.

The big difference was their ways of life. Sparta was all about the army and the state. It liked duty, discipline, and being strong in everything, like the army, schools, and public jobs. Athens also liked these but also liked things like thinking, art, and fun - things Sparta didn't care much about. Athens had rich and poor people, with the rich having power. Women in Athens had no rights, unlike in Sparta where they had more freedom. In Sparta, everyone respected each other, even if they were different. Women in Sparta could own things, talk in public, run homes, and help their husbands.
