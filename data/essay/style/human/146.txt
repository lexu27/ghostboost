Nephrology Dialysis Transplantation (NDT) is a journal from Europe that talks about science and health. It has many articles that study dialysis, transplantation, and kidney research. The NDT journal is liked by the European Renal Association (ERA), so it is good for scientists all over the world. Another article from StatPearls, found in the National Center for Biotechnological Information (NCBI), is also important for sharing approved research.

The article talks about why people get sick when their kidneys stop working well. The writers say that the sickness affects how well people get better and how some molecules make the sickness worse. New discoveries about dialysis are explained to help people feel better. When the kidneys are very damaged, it is a sign of a serious sickness called chronic renal failure. This sickness can be dangerous and doctors need to give medicine to help.

Chronic renal failure is seen in a few people out of a million. The number of people with this sickness is growing every year. The sickness can make people not pee much, and it can cause water to build up in the body. In some places, many people have this sickness. It is hard to know exactly how many people get sick with this. Doctors do tests on the blood and use machines to see the kidneys to find out what is wrong.
