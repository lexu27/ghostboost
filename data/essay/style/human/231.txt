The fashion industry is very exciting and changes a lot in many places. People like different clothes for different reasons. They want clothes that show who they are and how they fit in their society. Some shops sell many nice clothes, but these clothes are not made just for one person. Big shops like Zara and H&M try to understand what their customers want, but they can't do this for everyone in the world. This means many people have to buy what is available, not what they really want.
Our project, Be-Unique, wants to fix this by using technology to help customers. We want to make a website where people can see their favorite shops and even design their own clothes. Some shops only make clothes in standard sizes, which may not fit everyone. Our website will let people give their sizes so the clothes can be made just for them. Our team will help with this process to make sure everyone gets clothes that fit them well.
