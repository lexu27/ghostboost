There are many doctors who meet people who are forced to work but they don't know. The author Todres (2017) told a story about Dr. W who was asked to check the health of women who work at a company to see if they have infections from sex. The doctor should keep the women's secrets safe according to the American Medical Associationâ€™s rules from 2011. This includes not telling anyone about their bodies, information, choices, or friends. But the doctor was told not to write down the women's information to protect them from getting in trouble. So, the doctor knew that the women wouldn't get good healthcare and might spread the infections.

This situation involves many problems like laws about crimes, ethics, rights, and rules for services. In the crime laws, we can think that Dr. W is part of the crime because she knew about it but didn't tell anyone and helped it happen. This might not be good for her in court. In terms of rights, selling sex is against the law in the US. If young people work at the company, they must be reported according to the law (Todres, 2016). Ethical ideas also say that you should help a child even if it means breaking a secret.

To finish, when doctors meet people who are forced to work, they need to think carefully. If they help the company that is doing bad things, they are a bit responsible for the crimes and hurting women and kids. So, it's important to follow the rules and ethics and report these cases.
