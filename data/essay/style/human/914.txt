The contract is when some people agree to do something together. It can be about what they need to do or not do. The contract talks about what the people agree to and when it starts or stops. The contract can mean three things: 
1. A fact in law that starts, changes, or stops a legal relationship;
2. People agree on what they need to do and how;
3. A paper that says what the contract is about, like the important parts and the not-so-important parts. 

Some parts of the contract are always needed by law, and they happen even if they are not written down. Other parts can be added if the people want to. There are different types of contracts, like when only one person gets things, or when both people get things. Some contracts need something in return, like money or goods, while others are just given for free. It's important to know that a gift contract is one where something is given for free. But if all the rules of the contract are not followed, then it might not be a real contract.

Another kind of contract is an option contract. This one is different because both people need to agree for it to work. The things they agree to do depend on what the other person does. They can also decide when or how things will happen. If they don't agree on a time, a court might decide what to do.

In the US, making a plan to trick someone or pretending to agree to something wrong is called fraud. If someone lies or tricks in a contract, it's against the law. This shows that being dishonest in a contract is not allowed by the law.
