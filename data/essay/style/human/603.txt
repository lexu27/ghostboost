It is important to know that bags are sold in a big market, where different people buy them. Bags can be different in quality and use. So, changing the bag price is needed to make sure we make the most money using the data we have. The old price was $250, based on looking at fancy tote bags that cost $65-$250. The bag is 9×11 in size and made of leather, and each one costs $36 to make. The first price was chosen to make the most money, but it didn’t think about how price affects how many bags people want to buy. So, the new price is $65, which is almost twice the cost to make it, and we expect to make $29 profit on each bag. 

55% like to buy bags online, and tote bags are getting more popular. Some cheaper bags cost less than $65, but our bag is made of leather and is a bit fancy, so it can’t be less than $65. The people we want to buy our bag are middle-class and rich moms. But our brand is not famous yet, so we need to advertise it well. So, it’s not fair to set a very high price and maybe not sell many, and it can’t compete with fancy bags because people don’t know it.
