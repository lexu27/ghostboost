Examining changes in America long ago, we see that women did big things in changing how people think. They fought old rules and changed how society saw them, making a new way for men and women to be seen together. One special law called the 19 th Amendment helped this change happen. But making this law accepted by everyone wasn't easy because some people didn't like it, especially in some places with racism. Even though the early women's rights movement didn't have many different voices at first, it did start the 19 th Amendment, even if some women in Tennessee didn't like it because they thought it would help African Americans too. 

Different suffragettes had different ideas about the 19 th Amendment. For example, Belle Kearney mostly cared about helping white middle-class women, while Adella Hunt Logan wanted to help all women, no matter their race or background. Another suffragette, Addams, saw voting as just another duty at home. But some people like Winslow thought voting was a big deal for women, and it was a time for America to wake up and be fair. 

Not all women were happy about the 19 th Amendment. Some women in Tennessee really didn't want it and tried to stop it because they didn't want African Americans to vote. This showed how unfair things were back then and why it was important for all women to stand together, no matter their race. 

Even though some suffragettes didn't like African American women very much, most of them believed in helping all women. They knew that everyone should have the same rights, no matter where they come from. 

The Suffragette movement in the 1920s wasn't perfect, but it did help women move forward. Racism made things harder, but it also showed why all women needed to work together. By caring for each other and standing as one, women could make big changes for the better.
