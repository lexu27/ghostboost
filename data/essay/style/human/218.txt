The doctor's work is to follow rules, like being faithful to patients and valuing their choices. However, the job is about deep thoughts from philosophy, religion, and culture. Giving help in someone's death by a doctor is called doctor-assisted suicide. The doctor shares all needed things about what the patient wants for the end of life. But, a doctor can't always agree to help in this way for moral reasons.

If euthanasia is allowed, it might hurt the patient badly if not done right. So, a person might lose their usual life. Even when sick people ask to die because of a disease, doctors can't help them. This goes against the rule that says you can't take someone's life (Clarke et al., 2021). Also, helping someone to die goes against what a doctor should do, which is to help people. Doctors are meant to heal, but assisting in suicide doesn't seem to think about the dangers, which can be bad for patients.

The problem is with the Hippocratic oath all doctors take, which says not to harm. So, helping someone who wants to die can be seen as wanting to hurt them. Also, it might make patients not trust medical staff as much since taking a life isn't right. And, religion says doctors shouldn't help with end-of-life issues because it's wrong to kill. Plus, killing someone might be seen as very wrong by society. Medicine can help with a patient's pain, but taking a life is something that can't be undone.
