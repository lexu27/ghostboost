Electronic smoking devices make body sick same as other tobacco things. Also, some liquids can hurt the body cells. This can make people very sick. If normal smoking is bad because of black stuff and fire, this is bad because of liquids (Dinardo & Rome, 2019; National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA/NIH), 2018). It is very bad for health, slowly because not just the lungs get hurt, but also brain and heart.

In 2019, people talked a lot about how vaping is bad in America. In August that year, the Illinois Health Department said the first person died there from a bad lung sickness called EVALI. This means lung hurt from e-cigarettes. By the end of the year, almost forty people had died (Irusa et al., 2020). Many more people got sick. The dead people were between 17 and 75 years old.

So, laws should control how e-cigarettes are sold like normal cigarettes. Giving them to kids is not safe for the reasons said before. The only difference is no black stuff and bad smell, but inside, they are the same as regular cigarettes (Kennedy et al., 2022). Sometimes, only adults over 18 should buy them. Smoking harms lungs and other sicknesses, so it is already known to hurt. The law says people should only buy e-cigarettes after a doctor says it is safe for them. If the doctor says it's okay, they can be sold with less harm.
