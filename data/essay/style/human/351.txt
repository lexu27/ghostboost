The start of slavery in America and how it happened
From 1526 to 1776, many things influenced how slavery was in the United States. Historians have had different ideas about how slave trade changed. Slavery was connected to the need for workers in European colonies, especially in places like the Caribbean and South America where they grew sugar. Ships took people from Africa to the West, and some native people in North America were made slaves too. But by the end of the 1700s, Indian slavery mostly stopped.

How slavery was managed in different British colonies in North America
Enslaved people did different jobs like working in breweries, building ships, farming, and cutting trees. In areas above Maryland, slavery slowly changed to using free workers. The number of slaves in the North went down in the 1760s and 1770s, with only about 700 in Philadelphia in 1775. People in the city who were against slavery gave out booklets to both black and white people. Because of these groups, more slaves were set free, and slavery became less common in the North. In New York, many slaves learned important skills like building and working with gold. All slaves in New York were freed in 1827, even during the Revolutionary War.

How indentured servants and slaves were different
Indentured service was not the same as slavery. It was a kind of work agreement where someone worked without pay for a set time to pay for their journey to America. These workers didn't get money, but they were given food, clothes, and a place to stay. Slaves were seen as property and were rarely set free, even after many years of hard work. Slaves could be sold, traded, or used as part of someone's will.
