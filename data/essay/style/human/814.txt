A tort is when someone does something wrong and hurts someone else. The person who got hurt can ask for money to make up for it. Tom got hurt by a baseball that hit him and made him go to the hospital. Another bad thing that happened was when someone took his phone and wallet. If Tom can prove that he got sick from the food at the stadium and had to stay home for two weeks, that's also a tort.

The stadium is responsible for the baseball hitting Tom because they didn't warn about it. But they are not responsible for the theft. If Tom can prove he got sick from the food, then the stadium is responsible. But they are not responsible for the baseball hitting his head.

Even if Tom didn't buy a ticket, he still bought food from the stadium. If he gets sick from the food, the stadium is still responsible.
