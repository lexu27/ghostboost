The learnings about olden days when big countries and groups fell still catch the eye of many people who study. This is 'cause what they know can help fix problems now. So, this paper looks at how mighty military people racing and fights in different classes made the Roman Republic fall. I think both how things were made and the people's problems made it fall. This is 'cause they affect each other. For instance, a leader making bad choices 'bout money stuff can make the economy bad and make folks unhappy. This can lead to more problems that pile up. This is what happened to the Roman Republic - problems caused by things happening led to it disappearing.
One big reason for the Roman Republic falling was money matters. This came after many victories and turned into politics. As we know from history, Caesar getting killed was the end point. 'Cause of all the new lands, folks didn't need to pay taxes anymore. But this made cheating in elections common, with rich senators buying votes with big money. This led to laws that favored the rich.
The Gracchi brothers fought for the rights of the common people, who were struggling 'cause of the gap between classes. They wanted to help the poor by taking land from the rich. This would move folks like soldiers and farmers. They also wanted to give cheap food and clothes to the needy.
Another reason for the Roman Republic falling was the optimates and populares. One group liked the rich and the other fought against them. The power of the Senate was not based on laws, which made people lose trust in them.
Marius and Sulla were also important, causing chaos in Rome. Marius changed the army system, and because he wanted power, he went against the Senate. Caesar's killing was the last straw for the republic. People worried that his power was a threat to democracy, so they killed him. These events led to the fall of the Roman Republic.
