There are many types of small living things in the water. Among the Nitrite bacteria, there are six types: Nitrotoga, Nitrospira, Nitrolancetus, Nitrospina, Nitrobacter, and Nitrococcus. One interesting bacteria is Nitrobacter which helps plants to eat. It releases nitrogen from plants. This paper talks about Nitrobacter, its special things, and where it lives.

Nitrobacter is most interesting because it changes nitrite to nitrates. This happens when bacteria get nitrates from ammonia. Two bacteria, Nitrobacter and Nitrosomonas, help in this process. Nitrification is when this happens in the soil. It is a cool thing in nature. The nitrogen cycle is an important part of nature. Bacteria in the soil help in many chemical steps to change nitrogen.

In general, Nitrobacter helps keep many small living things in the soil by its work. It helps plants eat and keeps the soil good. Because of this, Nitrobacter is a very interesting type of bacteria.
