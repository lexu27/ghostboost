Various cultures in the world got unique stories about how everything began and how they show them using art. The Aztec people had a different way of thinking about the world compared to the Europeans who beat them. For example, the Europeans' God from the Bible made people like him and gave them power over a perfect place called the Garden of Eden. In their holy book, God is like a kind but strict dad who forgives people when they make mistakes and gives them a way to be saved forever. They draw God as a smart old man with a white beard. Their art talks a lot about how God forgives and how beautiful the world He made is.

In contrast, the Aztec stories about how everything started include gods getting cut into pieces, so the beginning of the world was very violent. That's why Aztec art shows gods in a scary and amazing way. Their art tells people to be careful and do what they are told. They ask for blood in return for food, and all the sculptures of gods in Aztec art have a place for human hearts. Unlike the Christian story, the main character is a female god, but like Eve, she doesn't do much and gets punished by other gods. Also, when Coatlique decided to have another baby even though her children didnâ€™t want it, it's like the Aztec version of Eve disobeying.

Both Aztec and Christian gods are said to be perfect and complete on their own. But in Aztec stories, gods are not good or bad, unlike in Christianity where evil is what Satan controls, and it's the opposite of God. This means that Aztecs have to make a violent goddess happy to get food and stay alive. On the other hand, Christians must say no to sin and give their spirit to God to be saved forever. The Christian story is about forgiving and loving, while the Aztecs' story is about surviving through violence. This difference shows in how they make their art.
