Case Summary
This story is about Christopher Lee Peterson, who worked for Wilmur Communications and followed the World Church of the Creator. In 2000, Peterson talked to the local newspaper about WCC, sharing his bad thoughts, supporting a shooter who hurt African-American, Jewish, and Asian people. When the boss knew about the talk, he stopped paying Peterson and later gave him a lower job with less money. The law called Title VII says it's wrong to treat someone badly because of their religion, so Peterson sued the company for moving him to a worse job.
Creativity, also known as World Church of the Creator, is a group that believes in white supremacy and keeping races separate. It started in 1973 by Ben Klassen and later led by Matt Hale after Klassen died in 1993. Klassen said the group should fight against other races, calling them bad, and believed white people were the best. Even though they said they were a religion, they didn't believe in gods, just race. They also said the Holocaust didn't happen and wanted a world only with white people. Over time, the group attracted mean people who did bad things.
Peterson, a member, was in charge of a team with both white and non-white people. In March 2000, he was in the newspaper talking about WCC. The article said Peterson agreed with WCC and showed respect for a shooter. Even though Peterson's ideas were like the KKK and not good, the court said his demotion was wrong and based on religion.
Questions about the Case
What the boss should do after reading the news
If I was the boss and saw the news, I would find a way to fire the worker legally. It's my job to keep the workplace safe. If the news makes some employees uncomfortable, I need to think if this worker is right for the company. I don't want the employees to feel scared at work because then it's my fault. Even if the worker didn't do anything bad yet, I don't want to take the risk. Also, the fact that he had non-white workers makes his support for the shooter a threat. So, it's better to remove the problem before it gets worse.
What the court's choice means
The court's choice is right because the demotion was because of the worker's beliefs. But it's strange that the court saw WCC as a religion. Creativity doesn't believe in gods or anything magical, just in racism and white supremacy. Although legally WCC counts as a religion, the ideas in the White Manâ€™s Bible are not good for a safe workplace. So, even if the court was right, the company was also right to demote Peterson.
What the boss should do if a worker mistreats non-white workers
As the boss, it's my duty to keep the workplace safe. Mistreating non-white workers is serious and needs a hearing to check what happened. Some companies ignore bad things for money, especially if the bad worker is important. But for me, the workers matter more. I have to punish those who make trouble, no matter who they are. Depending on how bad it was, the punishment could be a warning or firing the worker.
