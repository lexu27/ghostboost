In the long-ago times of XVI-XVII centuries, when fancy art was very popular in Europe, religion had a big effect on art growing. Many special things like icons, altars, colorful windows, and other art stuff with religious pictures appeared. In this paper, we talk about how religion helped make paintings better by looking at some special pieces. 

The Sistine Chapel Ceiling by Michelangelo is a very famous painting from the Renaissance time. It has 33 parts, each with different stories. The main parts show stories from the book of Genesis, and there are also pictures from the Old Testament and Christ's ancestors. At first, the colors were bright, but now they are darker. The people in the painting have light skin and wear soft colors, which gives a calm and big feeling. This painting shows how Michelangelo was very religious. It tells a special story about how people grow spiritually and their relationship with God. Even though it was just a ceiling, Michelangelo put a lot of respect for religious things into it.

The Isenheim Altarpiece by Gr√ºnewald was made for a chapel at a hospital in Isenheim. It was painted five years before Luther did something big in 1517. This painting shows a lot of pain from the early 16th century. It is very different from the happy Italian paintings from that time. The part about the crucifixion is sad and pale, but the other parts have bright colors and strange pictures of the devil. This painting makes people think about why there is suffering and how something good can come from it. The focus on Christ's pain has a big effect on how people feel when they see it.
