In the new world, nurse job is changing a lot: From a helper to doctor, the registered nurse (RN) is very important in the clinic. RNs help communicate with patients, families, and doctors, so treatment and getting better depend on their work. Because the nurse job is changing, I got interested in this field and want to study nursing as my job. 
Nursing is very important now, especially during the COVID-19 time. There are more than 4.2 million RNs in the USA. This big number is about 1.3 percent of the whole population, which means one person in 100 is a nurse. This data shows how important this job is, many people wouldn’t choose it if not needed. A study by Rafferty says nurses can make healthcare better. Also, more men are becoming nurses, which is good for this job and stops people from thinking badly about it.
In the past, people didn’t think nurses were important. Some healthy people still think nurses are not important. But nurses have their own role now with new tasks and education. I like this job because nurses can keep learning and help sick people, which is why I want to study nursing. 
To become a nurse, I need at least four years for my BSN degree. I might study more after that. It will cost around $40,000 (NJ) on average, and I plan to save money for it. I will study hard, do my homework, and tests to get good knowledge for my future.
My main goal is to get a BSN degree in nursing. I want to keep learning even after that. I will work hard for the next four years to reach my career goal.
