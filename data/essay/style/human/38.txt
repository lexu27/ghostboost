The America and Lithuania cultures have changed a lot for many years. They mix languages, religion, food, and more. Lithuania has not many people from other countries living there, so America has more different cultures. In America, people speak mostly English, and in Lithuania, they speak Lithuanian. In both places, there are many other differences that researchers found when they look at them. Americans are more friendly, but Lithuanians are not very warm and don't show their feelings. Americans think that being polite and reacting creatively are important for talking well, but in Lithuania, it's not as crucial (Jakucionyte, 2020). In the US, families teach their kids values that come from their religion. Some common things are helping others and wanting to do well in their job (Smith et al., 2021). In Lithuania, family is very important.
