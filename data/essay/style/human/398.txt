The article talk about Professor Wilson and how he live in a small place like a dumpster. He want to be very eco-friendly and share his experiences with his students. I think about an old Greek man who live in a barrel. The article tell about Wilson's life and how he feel after getting divorced. I see the photos in the article and it make me relax. I have some questions, so I read more to find answers. Living in a dumpster seems okay for a short time, but no bathroom or kitchen is a problem for me.
