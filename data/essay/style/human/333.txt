According to Kantâ€™s idea, the difference between a person and a thing is based on some basic rules, mostly about being free and important. A thing is just a tool to finish something, while a person has everything needed inside. A person is different from the world in a way, but is special and can't be used. This is called independence, meaning a person can do things on their own. Independence decides a person's inner power to do stuff and know what's good and bad. Kant says a person, unlike a thing, knows what's right and wrong, like a map that everyone has. Because a person can understand good and bad and use them right, they are not like a thing. A person can't be used and so, unlike a thing, is valuable.

A person's worth should be seen as something they have since birth and can't lose, no matter where they are from or what they do. But worth is not just a personal idea because it can also come from others, like respect or kindness. This means that the idea of human worth may not always be just personal. Ideas about how worth can be given or born with can change how doctors work. A doctor who thinks they give worth to others by caring for them may make mistakes about what is right or wrong. A doctor who believes in equal worth and thinks it's part of a person can respect a patient's freedom. But this might cause problems if a patient's freedom clashes with the doctor's job. Still, a doctor who sees human worth as something that can't be lost follows key rules of bioethics like freedom and fairness more closely.

When McLean talks about how worth isn't useful in medicine, he means that talking about worth in bioethics can get in the way of treating patients. Somerville says in her book that when people agree on what worth is, then it matters in bioethics. But if they can't agree, the idea of worth loses value. The idea of worth can change and be twisted so that a person's worth is hurt, making them lose their worth. There is a way of thinking that says a person must meet certain rules to be truly human. This is a third way to use this idea, where using it wrong is dangerous.

A person can be known by how smart and aware they are, which decides what they want in life and what's right. But some people with brain problems may not meet the rules to be seen as human. So, those who think their worth inside doesn't matter can hurt their outside worth. This is a big mistake in judging what's right and very risky for medical rules. Also, the question of worth comes up when talking about embryos, making it hard to know how to treat them right in an abortion. A person's outside worth comes from how others see and treat them, which is really important in bioethics and medicine. Trying to see worth in each person can help a doctor make good moral choices and help other pros do the same.
