Jesus started his talk by talking about the Beatitudes. Each one begins with the word blessed, which means happy. At first, it seems like the Beatitudes are for comforting those who are suffering. But Jesus also teaches how privileged people should act in this chapter. The words talk about finding comfort for those who are suffering. This question was important for my project. Patients can find answers in the Bible - believing and praying people can be sure that God listens to them.
Health workers will try their best to help everyone. They work following God's plan and help patients connect with God. As a health worker, I believe my job helps those in need. These words give hope to those who have lost it and guide those seeking justice. But they don't say when relief will come for illnesses.
Matthew Chapter Five talks about different things. In verse eleven, it says to stay blessed when persecuted for faith. This verse is hard for me because when criticized, I doubt myself. However, I now think that criticism helps me grow in faith. The Bible guides me in my health care job. It helps me stay focused and give hope to others. These words also remind me of my spiritual emptiness and need for God.
