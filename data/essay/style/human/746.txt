People from different places think differently about things outside. They follow their own values that show how they act in the world. For example, they might decide to change or control it. One big difference is how Western and some Native American groups see nature, customs, and their communities. Knowing these differences and making good connections can help small cultures and nature. 

Look at Lummi people as an example. They are a Native American group in Washington. They face a lot of trees being cut down for a long time. These trees were special for them, but they got destroyed over the years. This almost made the whole group disappear. Now, the tribe and groups like the Washington State Department of Natural Resources want to work together to save whatâ€™s left of the forests and the tribe.
