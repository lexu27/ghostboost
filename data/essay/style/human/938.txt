For long time, people thought about being fair to everyone and not looking at where they from. But this idea made white people more important. In the US, being equal meant acting like a white man. So, even though everyone was supposed to be the same, only some groups had to give up who they are. This was clear with Japanese Americans who had to act like the model minority to fit in. To be accepted, minorities had to forget their own culture and take on another one.

This is not real equality. True equality lets you be yourself without being left out. Also, being interested in other cultures helps us grow and think better. Discrimination has made many ethnic groups' history disappear, so now we need to make sure everyone knows and respects their ancestors. Some say that understanding different cultures is hard, especially at work or school. But learning about diversity should not make separate groups. It's about learning from each other to find common ground and not treat minorities badly.
