It important to know that making decisions is difficult and needs correct information, clear goals, and understanding issues. Mistakes in making decisions are common and can happen to any boss. But, there is a difference between a bad decision and a wrong decision. In a wrong decision, the choice is made because of wrong or fake information but with good intentions to choose right. In a bad decision, the boss knows the right information but picks the wrong way on purpose. A bad choice can happen for many reasons like a clash between what the boss wants and what the company wants or just emotions affecting the choice. Wrong decisions need changes to get the right information for a good decision.

To get better at making decisions now and in the future, it is important to improve how data is collected and used. It is said that decisions can be messed up by mistakes and wrong things in the data, making it hard to make good choices (Schuh et al., 2017, p. 425). So, using good and correct ways to collect data can really help a boss know more and make right choices by seeing the bigger picture clearly.
