Introduction
Justice system in United States of America was made for many specific social and moral goals. It punishes people who break rules or are not good morally. Justice also decides how people in society must be treated. Justice also helps people become part of society again. Different people think different goals of justice are more important. When a person finishes their punishment and leaves prison, people expect them to be a normal part of society, following rules. But sometimes, people do more bad things after leaving prison. People who do this are called repeat offenders, habitual offenders, or career offenders. The help available for people after prison is not very good, so many people struggle outside of prison. In many cases, repeat offenders cannot adjust to life outside the criminal justice system, so they go back to breaking rules. Because of this, US laws have rules for working with people who know the justice system. Career offender rules are meant to reduce people doing bad things again and stop criminal behavior. But these rules do not always work well. This review will talk about career offender rules and if they help in the justice system.

Overview
Career Offenders
First, let's talk about the name "career offender." A person is called a career offender when they are over 18 years old, did a violent or drug crime, and have done similar crimes before (Burnham & Gorokhov, 2017). If a person meets all these things, they are a career offender in the US justice system. This comes with more punishment, making charges in court more serious. Also, the person's criminal history is seen as worse. This means most career offenders spend more time in prison. People can argue against being called a career offender, and not everyone can be one.

The system of career offenders was made to stop people from doing bad things again and stop crime. But the extra time people get in prison isn't based on real facts. Also, not all kinds of crimes are included in these rules. Things like stealing, corporate crimes, and hurting others are not part of the rules.

This makes the system not work well and might affect certain groups more than others. Because of where they live, how much money they have, and being poor, certain groups are more likely to get long punishments for drug and violence crimes (Blankenship et al., 2018). Especially black people are more likely to be punished for drug crimes. This means black people and others find it hard to leave prison. Even if they finish their punishment, it's hard for them to adjust to normal life. This hurts non-white communities. Black men are especially affected and have a hard time becoming part of society.

Three-Strike Law
The three-strike law is another way to talk about systems like career offender rules. This means people get harsher punishments after breaking rules three times. The way these laws are used depends on the state. Unlike career offender rules, three-strike laws focus on specific kinds of serious crimes. Most states use this law with different levels of strictness. The big problem with this law is that many people get life in prison for their actions. In California, for example, time between crimes doesn't matter. This means a person can get life in prison for something they did many years ago.

Also, three-strike laws are similar to career offender rules in some ways. They focus on crimes seen as very bad and make punishments harsher. Researchers say these laws might not stop crime but instead make social problems worse. The law was made to keep dangerous people away from others and keep society safe. This meant that people like murderers and rapists had fewer chances to break rules again (Flores, 2020). But now, most people in prison because of this law did non-violent crimes. This law doesn't work as planned and makes life harder for smaller offenders.

First Step Act
The last law we talk about is the First Step Act. This law helps people who break rules many times get better. It started in 2018 and was meant to stop people from breaking rules again. The law was made to make long prison times shorter and give people a way to improve themselves. It also wanted to make prisons better. This law helps with bad and violent things in prison, making it less hard for people there. The First Step Act lets judges give shorter punishments to repeat offenders. After the law started, 3100 people got out of prison earlier. The law worked quickly, with people getting less time in prison. But we don't know if it works well everywhere yet.

Recommendation
I don't agree with how career offender laws and similar rules are used now. These laws want to punish people more to stop bad things, but they don't always work. Many researchers say the only thing these laws do is put more people in prison. They don't help people become part of society again, hurt communities, and don't stop crime. These laws also make it harder for people in the justice system. Career offender laws focus on some criminals more than others, especially those connected to drugs and violence. This makes their punishments much worse.

Black people, because of how they are treated by police, history of crime, and other things, are more likely to get punished for drug crimes. This makes it hard for some groups and their communities. Three-strike laws focus on more kinds of crimes but don't look at the time between crimes or why they happened. These laws don't stop crime and make things worse for some people. They don't help people be part of society after prison. Laws like the First Step Act work to help people fit into society. By making it easier for people to get lighter punishments or less time in prison, they make people follow rules and help the prison system.

Conclusion
In the end, laws for people who break rules many times are not good. Different states in the US use different laws to punish repeat offenders. But these laws aren't fair. People who did small crimes are stuck in prison, while dangerous people are not helped or caught. The First Step Act tries to make prisons better for people who break rules. But it doesn't really fix the main problem. Career offender laws don't help in the right way and make the justice system worse. We need to find a different way to help people who break rules, focusing on making things better instead of just punishing. Helping former offenders be part of society again is better for everyone.
