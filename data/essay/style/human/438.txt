When I think about interesting people, Neil deGrasse Tyson is one of them. He is a famous space scientist who talks about space on different places. I like the things he says because they make me think a lot. I think he knows many things that not everyone knows, and I find that really cool.

Neil deGrasse Tyson was born in 1958 and went to different universities like Harvard and Columbia University. He also did some important work for the president about the future of space stuff. I really like space, it's so big and unknown. I watched many shows about space, and one of them was narrated by Neil deGrasse Tyson.

I think he knows even more things than what he says on TV. If I could talk to him, I would ask about aliens. I always wonder if there are other places with life in the universe. I also want to know if he knows secret things about space from NASA.

So, Neil deGrasse Tyson is someone I find really interesting. I want to talk to him one day and learn new things about space that are not talked about much. I think he has many more things to tell us.
