Service marketing is when we tell people about things that you can't touch or keep, like a concert or a game. These things are different from things you can hold because you can't save them for later. If you don't go to the concert, it's gone forever. Sometimes concerts get canceled, and then they don't happen at all. Concerts only last for a specific time, like two hours. Because of this, people might want more from concerts than from things they can keep.

Another thing about service marketing is that it's hard to know how many people will want the service. This can make it tricky to make money. For example, if only half the tickets for a concert are sold, that's a loss. If people don't like the service, they can't get their money back. This makes customers expect a lot from the service. To solve these issues, it's important to plan well and set the right prices.
