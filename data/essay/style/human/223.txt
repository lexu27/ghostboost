In comparing the two sick situations, Typhoid and COVID-19 virus, two people, Typhoid Mary and Novak Djokovic, were said to have gotten sick with those sicknesses. The people who take care of public health quickly looked into the problems of the two sick people. They did tests on two people in both cases. They found out what happened to Typhoid and coronavirus in the tests, and they used a study to look back at both cases. The difference is that Mary got typhoid, but Novak got coronavirus, and Mary spread the sickness, but Novak did not.

According to two stories, they looked at the sicknesses in groups like families. Djokovic, the tennis winner, was the fourth player to get sick with COVID-19, and Mary was sick with typhoid. In Mary's story, you can see the rich family of Charles, a banker. One of his daughters and his wife got typhoid from Mary, who worked as a cook. Djokovic's wife also had coronavirus, like Mary, where lots of people she knew had gotten sick. So, the same thing is that in both cases, the families of these sick people were affected. Also, three other tennis players in the Adria tour got COVID-19. In Mary's story, when she worked for the Warrens, two people who cleaned the house and one gardener got typhoid. So, the main problem in both stories is that the people around these sick people got sick with COVID-19 and typhoid.
