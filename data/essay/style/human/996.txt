Economic globalization is a big thing that happens because of many reasons. Some people say it is bad for many countries and the whole world. But, some people think it is good for human society, even though there are some bad things about it. It is important to see the good things about economic globalization instead of fighting against it.

Economic globalization helps people trade better because they can get different things from different places. People from all over the world can sell things to each other with technology. This brings new ideas and products that make life easier for people. People, companies, and countries can work together on big projects.

But, some people say that economic globalization makes some people richer and some people poorer. They think that rich countries use poor countries' resources. This makes poor countries even poorer. However, some studies show that economic globalization is not the only reason for poverty and inequality. Poor countries have problems like corruption and not being able to use new technology and ideas. If these problems are fixed, developing countries can also benefit from economic globalization. Rich countries should use resources responsibly, and poor countries should fight corruption and make their countries stable. In the end, globalization can help all countries become better and reduce inequality everywhere.
