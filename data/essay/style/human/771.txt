Throughout the COVID-19 problem, there were big problems with getting medical things to the right places. It was hard to send the important stuff where it was needed. To make things better, we can divide the workers into small groups and teams to work in different places.

Medical things are used to help sick people get better. They are very important, and if we can't get them, it can be very bad for people. So, we need a good system to send medical things where they are needed. At the start of the big sickness, we needed a lot of medicine in some places, and we had to pack them up and send them out. I had an idea to split into small teams, and this helped us send the medicine faster.

In the end, it's very important to have the right medical things for sick people. If we don't get them, it can be very dangerous. I had the idea to divide into small teams, and this helped us send the medicine quicker.
