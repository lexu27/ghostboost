In the now tough competition because of the pandemic, lots of car companies try hard to get new customers and keep the ones they have. Toyota is known worldwide for always trying to make customers happy with good products that last a long time. They are very serious about making sure there is no CO2 in the air in the future, by making cars that use less fuel and have cleaner engines. Now, during the pandemic, Toyota is making sure to keep everyone safe from getting sick by following all the rules to stop infections (Cenizo, 2020). They also make sure their staff can fix any problems with the cars and even check them for free if something goes wrong. But what really makes Toyota special is their MyToyota app (Toyota Sustainability Report, 2020). It gives customers lots of good things like special deals, booking services online, and discounts for hotels or sports events, which makes customers like the brand even more. 

It's really hard to find a car company that only makes people happy and doesn't listen to complaints. According to the 24/7 Wall Street report, Volvo has 33% of customers who stay loyal (Suneson, 2019). But many Volvo drivers don't want to buy their cars again and experts say there are better options out there. Volvo doesn't do much to make customers happy or change what experts say about them. So, not only the price and quality matter for customer loyalty, but also how the brand handles complaints and suggestions makes a big difference in how people feel about the brand.
