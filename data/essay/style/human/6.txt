Autumn is not very good for having a big sale in the neighborhood. But my place is different from others because we always have a big sale in autumn. Last year, it was fun even though the weather was not good and some people were worried about getting sick.
People sold many things, and even though they were old and not expensive, they had interesting stories. Some kitchen things were very old and showed where they came from long ago.
During the sale, there was some excitement when a kid found their toys being sold. But the person who bought them understood and gave the toys back, which was nice.
We also gave some money to help people in need, like those sick with the virus or people who are poor. The sale was not very successful, but we helped some people who needed it.
Besides making money, the sale was a good time to share memories and feelings. Even though having a sale might seem normal, it was special for us to talk and learn new things from each other. Even though autumn might not be the best time for a sale, it was a good chance for us to have fun and help others. The fall sale is a strange tradition, but I liked it a lot.
