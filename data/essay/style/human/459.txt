Overpopulation in cities is big problem now. It make city too full and dirty. Pollution from cars make air not good. Also, many poor people come to city for job but no good education. They work hard but not get much money. Trash from people also big problem. In some countries, they separate trash and recycle some. To fix pollution, people should use bus more. Government can build more roads and buses. Poverty getting better now and will keep getting better in future.
