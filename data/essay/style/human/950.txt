Mexican culture is very hard to explain in a short paragraph or a whole essay. This is because it has many different things like influences, history, and many other stuff from civilizations like Mayan and Aztec. Mexican culture can be seen in art, food, customs, values, and religion. So, Mexican culture is like a mix of old Mayan and Aztec things and new European ideas that affected language and religious beliefs. Religion is a big part of Mexican culture, with important holidays like Feast of Our Lady of Guadeloupe on 12th December. Even though Christianity was forced on Mayan and Aztec people, it became a big part of Mexican beliefs. Mexican culture also values spirituality and family. For example, the Day of the Dead festival on 1st and 2nd November is about remembering and honoring ancestors. Families make special things to give to their ancestors since they believe their spirits come back to visit.
When people think about Mexico, they may think about big hats, colorful clothes, yummy food, and mariachi bands. I think three important things that show Mexican culture are the costumes during the Day of the Dead, the Mariachi band, and the Pyramid of the Moon in Teotihuac√°n. The Day of the Dead is about connecting living people with dead ones in a spiritual and family way. Music is also a big part of Mexican culture because it shows the passion and spirit of people. Lastly, the pyramids in Mexico show the link between Mexican culture and old civilizations.
