In every company, no matter what type, the collected basic information needs to be put in order, summarized, and shown in a way to make the information useful. Evans and William (2014) say that statistics means the knowledge about gathering data, organizing it, looking at it, explaining it, and showing it. From a religious view, statistics means adding up and counting. In Numbers 1:2, God told Moses to, “Count all the people of Israel, by their families, with the number of their names, every man by their heads” (King James Bible, 2017). They also say that knowing about Six Sigma in statistics is important because it helps to understand how data might change over time (Evans and Williams, 2014). As a person in charge of healthcare, this knowledge is important because it will help me see how my organization is doing compared to others, and how different measurements are related.

Descriptive statistics is how data is shown with numbers and pictures, like charts and graphs, to help explain information. Programs like Access and Microsoft Excel help employees summarize data (Evans and Williams, 2014). For me as a healthcare leader, using descriptive stats will be important to make the time needed for patient care shorter. Also, using these programs will help my team quickly find patient info for admissions and discharges. This will help them manage patient health better. As Cox et al. (2014) say, by understanding statistical measures and theories, healthcare places can care for patients better and make more money. So, using statistics is crucial under my leadership to offer prompt care, make appointments on time, and have smooth transitions.

The main stats and formulas are mean, median, mode, and variance. Mean, shown as µ, is the average number of the dataset (Kros and Rosenthal, 2016). It is also used to find the center of the data. Median is the middle number or the 50th percentile (Evans and Williams, 2014). In my role, the median will be the middle number when arranging data. For odd numbers, the median will be the middle number, and for even numbers, it will be the average of the two middle numbers. In Excel, the median can be found using the MEDIAN function. 

Mode is the number that occurs most frequently. As a healthcare leader, the mode is important because it shows how many unique data points there are. When Excel is used, the MODE function can find the mode value. Lastly, variance shows how spread out the data is. The bigger the variance, the more spread out the data is. Excel cannot calculate variance, so it has to be done manually.
