Introduction
The study of philosophy helps a person solve problems and think about life in new ways. Philosophical skills let scholars look at ideas, arguments, and important topics that affect how we see life (Blanshard 12). These skills help organize thoughts, deal with important matters, and find what's important in lots of information. Philosophy is important for education because it makes us think a lot. This essay talks about how philosophy is important in higher education and how it helps us think about things like thoughts, energy, and the world. In higher education, philosophy means learning about important people and ideas from the past, using new techniques, and understanding philosophical questions. Learning philosophy helps scholars think critically, analyze things, and see the big picture in life.

Main Qualities of a Philosopher
Philosophy is important for four main reasons in higher education. It helps students think better, understand texts, write well, and communicate effectively. These skills are important for building our identities and making us think deeply about reality, knowledge, and importance (Rick 583). Some key qualities make a scholar a good philosopher who can have good discussions and make smart decisions in everyday life. Common traits include being open-minded, doubtful, and thinking carefully.

Being Open-Minded
Being open-minded is a big part of being a good philosopher. It means being willing to change your opinions when needed. Open-mindedness isn't about having the right opinions but about being humble and open to changing your mind when needed. It helps us correct our mistakes and see things clearly (Blanshard 32). Open-mindedness is important in philosophy as it helps us avoid making the same mistakes and see things from different angles.

Doubtfulness
A good philosopher should also be a bit doubtful, questioning the information given in discussions. Doubtfulness means not blindly believing what we hear but asking questions and seeking reasons for what others claim (Rick 571). It helps us think critically and not just follow what others say without thinking.

Thinking Systematically
A good philosopher should also think systematically, looking at how things are connected and how they work together. Systems thinking helps us understand complex problems better and predict what might happen in the future (Blanshard 12). In philosophy, thinking systematically helps us see the big picture and make better decisions. Philosophers like Socrates showed some of these skills by using logic and reason to find knowledge and understand the world.

Argument for Socrates
Socrates is seen as a good example of a philosopher who used logic and reason to learn new things. According to Socrates, knowledge comes from exploring the world around us (Blanshard 22). Socrates taught that philosophy is about asking questions, learning about ourselves, and understanding our limits through self-reflection and examining life.
