Rhinoceros is a very good drawing made by Albrecht Durer. He made a drawing of the animal many times, showing that European people liked animals from Asia. His work was very good and helped people learn things and enjoy looking at it. The story of the drawing can tell us about how Europe, India, and the Islamic world were connected.
It is important to know some things about Albrecht Durer. He was a famous artist who made special drawings. Durer never saw the rhino himself, but he made his drawing using pictures and writings from Lisbon. He knew many other famous people like Raphael, Leonardo da Vinci, and Bellini. Even though Durer did not see a real rhino and drew it wrong, his drawing became very popular.
The drawing of the rhino made in 1515 was not correct. The drawing shows the rhino with armor plates. People started to see the drawing more for its looks than for real information about the animal. Durer’s rhino also has a small horn on its back, scaly legs, and saw-like back legs, which real rhinos don't have. Durer's interest in the rhino and many people buying the drawings show how much people liked things from the East.
The rhino in Durer's drawing had an interesting story. It was sent as a special gift many times and everyone who got it liked it a lot. For example, it was sent to King Manual of Portugal and became very famous. King Manual even made the rhino fight an elephant to see who would win. It was a special gift for the king. But, King Manual sent the rhino as a gift to Pope Leo X in 1515. This shows how the Islamic world wanted to be friends with Europe, how India was affected by the Islamic invasion, and how European kings wanted the Pope to like them.
The rhino was not the only animal used as a gift for diplomacy. For instance, it was a gift between different important people in India and the Islamic world. People liked the rhino because it looked real, unlike other drawings at that time. The animals were sent to keep good relationships with the western world, knowing that people there liked exotic animals.
To sum up, Durer’s Rhinoceros shows how people in the 16th century in Europe liked animals from the East. Even though Durer never saw a rhino, he made a drawing of it knowing people would like it. The story of the rhino being sent as a gift shows how India, the Islamic world, and Europe wanted to be friends, as the rhino was first given by Indians to an Islamic king, then to a European king, and then to the Pope.
