When talk about Parkinson's Sickness (PD), the patient's care, both from the community and health professionals, is a worry. So, my interest topic is the care and treatment of people with PD and how their lives could get better. I chose this topic because it's sad seeing patients struggling alone without good care from the community and health. The topic is a worry because helping the weak in the community makes a friendly place for all. Also, taking care of PD patients is a health worry because without help, patients with this problem could get worse and hurt their lives. I think PD can be treated, and patients with right medicine have small problems coping with life. When looking into the topic, the important words are 'right care for PD patients', which gives many nursing journals to pick from.

For keeping this project going, it's important to give proof on why the community needs to know about caring for PD patients. So, I plan to read many nursing journals about caring for people with PD. The journals talk about why PD education is important and why working together helps these patients. This project aims to show why PD education is needed and why the community should know about this problem. At the end of the time, how PD patients handle the problem will be compared to old data when the community didn't know much about PD. So, we hope for good care and easier life for PD patients.

My study about PD care is still going on as I found this article important. This article talks about moving care from hospitals to the community. According to Aye et al. (2020), working together with other health pros is the key to caring for PD patients. The article talks about not enough skills, bad teamwork, and hard communication to care for PD patients. Because moving all care outside hospitals is hard, the article suggests training and Telemedicine to make this happen soon. The research is based on Singapore's care model for PD. PD is the second most common brain sickness, with many people diagnosed. So, this forced a need for Patient-Centered Care outside hospitals.

I think this source is unfair about caring for PD patients. The article doesn't explain how patients get good care outside hospitals. Without education and Telemedicine, homes caring for PD patients will struggle to give good care. But, I agree that moving care out of hospitals is good because many hospitals can't handle the number of PD patients in places like Singapore. This makes it easier for caregivers and health pros to help PD patients. Reading this article gives ideas about PD care and why caring for PD patients is important.

It's important to know that all three articles agree that PD patients need good care to live better. They all say PD is a long-term brain sickness with tough symptoms. They also say it's important to care for caregivers and the community. The articles show how to support PD patients and their families for better life. This includes teaching the community about PD to help patients. While the articles agree on some points about PD care, the second article talks more about educating the public and how it helps caregivers. Educating about PD helps patients get better care and eases the load on caregivers. These articles teach us why PD care is needed.

This article talks about caring for people with Parkinson's Disease (PD). It says PD is a growing brain sickness, with many people affected worldwide (Halteren, Munneke, Smit, Thomas, Bloem & Darweesh, 2020). So, working together among families, health pros, and health services is needed to care for PD patients. The article gives a plan for caring for these people. It has five parts to help PD patients with their problem.

The first part is sharing care info among caregivers to understand better. The second part helps guide and support both caregivers and patients. Bad care hurts the quality of service received. The third part shares details about the physical and health of PD patients. Teaching them about their problem helps them manage it. The fourth part watches for early signs and symptoms to stop it from getting worse. The last part tracks, reviews, and checks the care plans to see if they work for PD patients.

This is a good source to start with for PD care. Reading this gives good ideas for caregivers and families with PD patients. It's important to support families and patients with PD, and in the future, I want to help them too. The info in this article is clear about caring for PD patients.

This is another interesting article about PD. It talks about how understanding the sickness helps care for PD. PD lowers some brain cells, but patients on medicine can live well. One problem is spotting signs of PD early. Caregivers find it hard to see these signs. The research says education is needed about the sickness. For example, a program called PEPP showed that educating caregivers and patients with PD helps them get better care. So, educating on PD helps patients and caregivers and makes life better for PD patients.

In my view, this article is useful like the first one. Caring for PD patients needs all caregivers to know about the problem to reduce worries.

So, I agree that educating about PD is needed to understand the sickness. Also, I support that caregivers with no info struggle more than those informed about PD. The study was done on 142 patients, both male and female. The findings can be used for all areas. PD care is hard for caregivers and the whole community, so education on the sickness is key to understand PD.
