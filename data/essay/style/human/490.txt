The Law for Food Safety Modernization (FSMA) is made to help with the problem of food safety, which worries many people in America – those who buy food and those who make it. My friend thinks that FSMA is not doing well in making food safer. They talk about the law, the risk of getting sick from food, food pollution, and give reasons why they think FSMA is not good. They say there is no proof that the law can make food better even though everyone agreed on it.

I think FSMA is not useless, and even though it has some problems, I do not agree with my friend. The law is making manufacturers more responsible for the food they make, which is a good thing. Thanks to FSMA, manufacturers, packers, and people who bring in food are doing things to keep people safe (Yiannas, 2021). Also, talking about food safety through FSMA is important for making things better in the future. So, we can see that the law is working.

After thinking about both sides of the argument, I believe that FSMA is good for making food better and keeping people healthy. Food can get bad at different points from making it to eating it. FSMA looks at the start – the manufacturers – and tells them what to do. Even though there are still risks in other places, this law is a big step for safety. It makes people pay attention to the issue, and in the future, we can expect more things to keep food safe.
