Miranda warning is a serious message telling a person who gets caught about their rights in America. It says they can stay quiet and have a lawyer. This is important for the fair American law. The warning helps both sides in the process. The person caught has rights that must be followed in court. These rights are in the U.S. Constitution, and not giving them is a big mistake. Rogers and Drogin (2019) say not everyone knows their rights well. If the rights are not told to the person caught, their words in court might not count. This is because they might have been forced to talk. Miranda warnings help both the person caught and the police. 
In some cases, rights might not be needed, like when a very dangerous criminal is caught. In these quick situations, the priority is to stop the criminal first and then deal with the law. In these cases, the warning can wait until after the danger is gone. But, it's still important to keep the warning for a fair trial. Even if not given right away, the rights will be told later before the formal legal steps start.
