One is watching the news or reading the latest article from Forbes, and you see the words “business” and “economics” used together; one might think about the dissimilarities. Business and economics are alike as they help each other, both working on making products and services and selling them to make money. These are subjects that are close and have many things in common, like companies, advertising, money, making things, and banks. Both are about money and numbers, looking at things that affect the market and making guesses about the future, as well as how different businesses work. Lastly, both business and economics look at issues that affect the country, its people, government, and companies. However, there are differences between economics and business, based on their main goals. Economics studies how people act and how that affects the whole country's money. Meanwhile, business studies how goods and money are traded, from making things to selling them, and how a company does this. Some say business is a part of economics, as it looks at how people act when trading goods. One big difference is that economics deals with big ideas like supply and demand, interest rates, and trade between countries. While these affect business, business looks at making money within the economy and using ideas that work. Economics tries to make society better, while business looks after its owners. They deal with different problems, with economics thinking about things like lack of money, people without jobs, taxes, and government spending, while business looks at selling things, making a brand stand out, advertising, growing or not making money, and how well a person or company is doing. Though business and economics have similarities, their differences in ideas and how they work make them separate subjects.
