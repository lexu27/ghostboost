Vitamin D is very important for our bones and helps the cells in our bodies talk to each other. It is special because we can make it when we are in the sun, not just from food or pills. This makes it different from other things we need for our body. Some people think it is a super important thing for our body. Unlike other things we need, you can get vitamin D from the sun. The sun is the best way to get this vitamin. It is like magic because it helps many parts of our body work well. For example, in the heart, it makes a calm and safe feeling when it connects with a special part of the same thing.
There are many studies about how important vitamin D is for our health. Some say a lot of people don't have enough vitamin D in their bodies. They found that between half and three-quarters of Americans need more of this vitamin. It is better for people to have enough of this vitamin for good health. But having low vitamin D and being sick are not always connected. They also found that keeping enough vitamin D can stop many breast and colon cancers.
Vitamin D is different from other vitamins because our body can make it. If we are in the sun for 15 to 30 minutes, our body can make a lot of this vitamin. But not many foods or pills have enough vitamin D. Except for some fish, eating normal foods does not give us enough vitamin D. Even milk and cereals do not have a lot of this vitamin. You can only get a little bit of vitamin D from them. Being in the sun for 30 minutes gives much more vitamin D than food can. So, it is hard to get enough vitamin D from what we eat.
Vitamin D is becoming very important in recent years. Not having enough of it can cause many health problems. But just because you are sick and don't have enough vitamin D does not mean one caused the other. By having enough vitamin D, you can stop some major health issues.
