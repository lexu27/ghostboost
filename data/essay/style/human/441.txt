The two American places where English people settled first were New England and Chesapeake Bay. In Chesapeake Bay, the English came with help from Virginia Company, which wanted to start colonies in America to make money. They didn't find gold like they hoped, but they started growing tobacco, which helped the region's economy (Corbett et al., 2022). The company hired poor English people to work hard growing tobacco and building the colony, and most of the new people were young men who weren't married (Corbett et al., 2022). On the other hand, the New England colonies had a different way of settling. They didn't come for money like in Chesapeake Bay, but to get away from being treated badly and bad things in England, and to make a good society (Corbett et al., 2022). Families moved to New England and they made their own farms, towns, and small businesses instead of big farms for crops like in Chesapeake Bay (Corbett et al., 2022). That's how the two places were different in how they started. 

Both places had a lot of religion, but different kinds. People who started the New England colonies wanted to make perfect Protestant communities, like in Massachusetts and Rhode Island (Corbett et al., 2022). In Chesapeake Bay, even though they were there to make money, the Anglican Church was important in their lives too. They wanted to be friends with Native Americans, so they tried to convert them to their religion, like when John Rolf married Pocahontas (Tsukada, 2020). So, Protestant and Anglican churches were both important in starting New England and Chesapeake Bay.
