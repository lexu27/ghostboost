Society very important for countries. People talk in groups, share thoughts, feelings. Being together in clubs, communities makes how they think, live, do politics. Changes in society big for countries. Putnam talks about this in his essay "Bowling Alone." He says social life in USA not good, don't know what will happen. Before, people in USA like to be part of society, but now not so much. People change, become more alone, not like before. Clubs not popular anymore, new groups more important but not good for society. Putnam worried about people not being together, might be bad for future. USA always strong community, but maybe not for long if nothing changes. If we don't change, we will be alone, not with others.
