Introduction
Many different groups of people follow rules and laws. Long ago, ancient societies used rules to keep everything organized. The Code of Hammurabi was one of the earliest written laws. It had 282 rules made by Hammurabi, a Babylonian king. These rules affected many parts of Babylonian life, like politics, fairness, money, and family and crime laws.

Justice and Success
The rules inspired fairness in different places. Hammurabi thought everyone should have justice. He said he wanted peace and fairness. He also wanted future leaders to keep his rules in mind. Hammurabi wanted to help people who were weak and treated unfairly.

In his idea of fairness and justice, Hammurabi also cared about success. He wanted people to be rich forever. He talked about money and the happiness of his people. He focused on private things like owning land, money, jobs, and markets. Hammurabi tried to help the Babylonians be successful in making money.

Acknowledging Business People
Farming and trading with other countries were key in Hammurabiâ€™s place. The rules talk about merchants who traded goods. Merchants did banking jobs in Babylon. One banking job was keeping money safe for others. To keep things safe, rules said there must be a written agreement with witnesses. The rules also said you need witnesses and fair judges.

Acknowledging Personal Things
The rules also said people could own land and things. Without rules about owning things, the Babylonian economy wouldn't work. Breaking property rules could lead to death. If someone stole from a god or king, they would be punished, even if they didn't know the things were stolen. The rules were strict about property rights and punished thieves with death.

Children's Worth
The rules talked about how important children were for money. Marriage was seen as a way to have kids. If someone couldn't have kids, they could marry someone else to try. Kids were valuable in farming. Rich landowners wanted sons to help with work and inherit things.

Fairness Idea
One rule showed fairness by punishing a person who didn't trade fairly. The rule said if a seller took money instead of grain for drinks, they would be thrown into water. The rules made sure that powerful people didn't hurt weaker ones. They made sure that people who suffered losses were compensated.

Inheritance Protection
When a husband died, his wife was protected by the rules. She could keep what her husband left for her. If her sons tried to kick her out, the rules said they would be punished. The rules made sure widows and orphans were safe and had rights.

Price Control
The rules set fixed prices for medical help based on the patient's status. If a surgeon saved a free person's life, they got silver. But if the patient was a slave, the surgeon got less. The rules also punished surgeons who caused death due to negligence. 

Hammurabi's Code and Its Importance
Hammurabi's Code was not a book about money or ideas. It was a set of laws to run Babylon. The rules showed that Babylon had economic freedom and that the state respected property rights. The rules also made sure powerful people treated weaker ones fairly. Many principles of modern capitalism, like owning property, using money, and following laws, can be seen in Hammurabi's Code. However, the rules didn't talk much about public money or supply and demand. Overall, the rules included important economic ideas like fairness, justice, and productivity.
