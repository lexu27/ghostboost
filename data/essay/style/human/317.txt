The writers of the Constitution did not think citizens would be very involved in the country's politics. They added many freedoms to the Constitution, but they were not sure if people would care enough about politics to pay attention. Back then, there was not much information available, but nowadays, the media helps people know a lot about political events. Also, the media watches over the government's powers. News agencies tell about the events and let readers decide what they think about them. But it's good not to rely too much on the media and try to follow the country's political life. The writers thought regular citizens didn't know much and didn't care about what was happening in the government.

I don't agree that citizens are uninformed and don't care about politics. Today, there are many groups that support civil rights and freedoms and follow what's happening in the country's politics. People don't wait for a crisis to share their thoughts; instead, they try to stay informed about what's happening. The media is a big help in providing information, letting people know about the latest events worldwide. Crises can make people more interested in politics, but many still work hard to share their thoughts, no matter the situation. These people deserve respect as they keep an eye on the powers of our politicians and judges, which are set by the laws we follow as a country.
