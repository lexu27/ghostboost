Genetic changed things (GMOs) are in everyone’s life. Some say it is not okay to change genes and act like God. But I think GMOs are just like new good things in life, like cars or big machines. I eat GMO food too, and I am not very worried about what might happen in the future. I think GMOs have been around for a long time, people always choose the best plants and animals to grow more of them. 

I would say that making good for many people is the best idea. GMOs can help with hunger because they can grow in bad places. Many people don’t have enough food, so more food is good. Some people say it is wrong to change genes, like it is a God thing. But I think it is okay because humans should look after the Earth, and using new tools is a good way to do it.
