Rousseau talk about loving yourself in two ways. He say one way is good and the other is not good. The good way is when you love yourself naturally without thinking about what others think. The bad way is when you love yourself too much and think you are better than others. This bad way of loving yourself can make people do bad things to each other. 

Rousseau also talk about how people become different because of loving themselves in a bad way. He say that rich people have more power and poor people have less power because of this bad kind of self-love. This makes society unequal. Orwell in his book 1984 show how a government can control people by watching them all the time and changing the way they think by using a new language called Newspeak. This language is made to control people's thoughts and make them easier to control.
