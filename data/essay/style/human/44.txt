Referring to competition, the competitive view covers many parts like how many companies there are, how big they are, what they are good and bad at, things that stop new companies from coming in or leaving, and the dangers from other similar things. Now, it is very different from before when companies just spent lots of money on ads and tried to be really big â€“ and it keeps changing because of fast technology progress. Because everything always changes, nowadays companies need to be very creative, able to mix things, change fast, and be quick. They need to use information to make good choices in business to be better than others and make business ways clear, use new market tech, and try to make customers happy. Basically, to keep up with others, most companies focus on what customers want, make their brand well-known, and keep customers coming back. There are many reasons why competition is like this now, such as new ways of doing business, keeping customers safe, showing prices clearly, very strong competition, and caring about nature, but the most important ones are being able to change and using technology. In other words, companies can't just use one idea to grow and should use all new tech to do better than others. So, those companies that can change, try different things, and see chances might do well even when things are hard. For example, NVIDIA, a big tech company that makes computer parts for professional jobs, games, and mobile devices, is doing very well even with COVID-19 causing problems. The company saw a chance when many people were at home and started offering services for working on computers and playing games. For example, in the last three months of 2020, about seven million Nintendo game machines with NVIDIA's parts were sold (Fitch, 2020). This situation shows that in today's competition, companies that can quickly change with any situation will keep making things and wanted by many people.
