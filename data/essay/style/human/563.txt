Various kinds of teasing are a big issue in schools. How young people behave and think when they are growing up can really shape how they see the world when they are older. Young people who tend to be mean with words and actions might keep being unkind in the future (Bondestam & Lundqvist, 2020). Teachers and school leaders need to watch out for all types of teasing, even ones that are about personal things, and look into them more to stop bad things happening to everyone involved. 
An article by Neil Duncan talks about how girls can get teased by boys in a not nice way. Studies show that this is a happening that doesn't always get solved. Bad things that come from students not getting along well include not being able to focus on learning, feeling unsure about themselves, and not accepting their own feelings about love and such. The writer talks about how girls and boys grow up in different ways and this causes problems (Duncan, 1988). Boys who are not good at dealing with feelings can show interest in a bad way without knowing the harm it does.
Many students don't get why this is a problem because they are young and don't know much. But bad things that happen when they are young can cause big problems when they are older. It's important to study how kids behave to stop any kind of mean behavior. Studies found that the ones who were hurt didn't trust the school to help and felt like they had to handle things alone (Aguilar & Baek, 2020). This shows that schools aren't doing a good job and need to change quickly.
