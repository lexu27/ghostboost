Subject and content of art are like friends, not same but close. Subject is what of art - people, places, things, themes. Content is about feelings, thoughts, symbols in art. Content is the brain of the art, while subject is like the face. They are together but different.
In the statue Tourists by Duane Hanson from 1970, we see old couple in bright clothes. They look like American tourists on vacation. The man has a camera, the woman has sunglasses and fancy bag. They seem to wait for something.
But the meaning is deeper. They are like average people from the 60s, spending money on vacations. They show the happy life of middle-class in the time without problems. Hanson wants to show how people with money enjoy life without worries. The tourists in the sculpture are not just travelers, they are symbols of carefree life of those with money.
