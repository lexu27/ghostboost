The Nora and Torvald's relationship changes a lot in the play. In the beginning, they look like a good couple, happy with their family roles. But later, they show their bad relationship and not happy. Torvald treats Nora like a child, not letting her decide. He cares about money and what others think, making Nora think she should only care about him and their kids. Nora thinks the same, trying to make Torvald happy. Their relationship shows that women were not always seen as important individuals. After Nora sees Torvald's true self, she leaves to find her own way.

Kristine and Krogstad's relationship changes too. Unlike Nora and Torvald, Kristine cared more about money and left Krogstad, even though she loved him. This made Krogstad very sad, showing he loved her too. Kristine saves him by giving them a chance to be together again. Krogstad just wanted love, understanding, and honesty, not money or respect. The big difference between the two couples is that Kristine and Krogstad love each other, so they can talk and fix things to be together again after a long time apart.
