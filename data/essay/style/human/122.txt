The topic of euthanasia is a very sensitive discussion. It talks about whether it is right or wrong to help someone die without pain. Some people say it is good because it stops suffering, while others say it is bad because it is like killing someone. Some theories, like teleology, deontology, and Levina’s “face of the other,” say euthanasia is not right and goes against moral laws.

Teleology is about things having a purpose, like Aristotle believed. He thought everything, even human life, has a reason and is meant to lead to happiness. Happiness is the main goal, and it is what makes life good. But people have different ideas about what makes life happy, and ethics tries to answer this. Death is not usually the answer for happiness, so according to Aristotle, euthanasia would be seen as wrong.

Deontology says people must follow certain rules and do what is morally right, like Kant said. Even if the outcome is good, some actions are always wrong. Euthanasia might seem good because it stops suffering, but morally it is wrong to end someone’s life. So, according to Kant, euthanasia is not right.

Lévinas talks about how we are responsible for each other when we meet face-to-face. He says that another person's right to live is more important than our own right, and we should not harm others. So, from his view, euthanasia is like being violent towards someone else’s life.

In conclusion, these theories all suggest that euthanasia is not a good thing. It does not lead to happiness, goes against moral rules, and harms someone else's life.
