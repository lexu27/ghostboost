An article was written by Ahram Online about what TV host Ibrahim Eissa said about the journey of Al-Miraj. El-Sayed Gamal El-Din, who wrote the article, first talks a little about the event and then tells what people and officials thought, and also gives some background about Eissa. The article also talks about the upcoming trial for what the TV host said.

We must look at the article in terms of ethics and how truthful it is. The article gives facts without giving personal opinions, which means it is unbiased. El-Sayed quotes what people said without adding his thoughts, which means it is fair. The reporter not just tells statements but also what people think and what might happen next, and also gives some background on Eissa. This helps readers understand more about what happened.

The author includes opinions from both official bodies and religious groups, which is good. The reporter uses neutral words and tries to give a lot of information about the event and how people reacted. This helps show how Eissa’s statements could affect society.

But the article could be better if it talked about if some people supported Eissa's statements or if everyone was against it. It also doesn’t give all the information needed.

Looking at the ethics, we can see if the news is fair. The article should cover all sides of the story, but it doesn’t talk much about what Eissa thinks or if there are people who support him. This could make the article one-sided and give readers a bad view of Eissa. The article is credible as it gives sources and facts, not just guesses.

We can say this news is true because it fits with what other people think. El-Sayed talks about what religious people think, which is important for Egypt. This news is like utilitarianism, which is about telling news that helps most people and doesn’t hurt them.

Another article from the BBC talks about how three men in Georgia were found guilty of hate crimes for killing a Black man. They killed Ahmaud Arbery because he was Black. The author gives details about the event and shares what lawyers and prosecutors think, and also talks about how important it is for the victim’s family.

This article follows ethics better than a local news story. It gives facts and includes all details about the event, including who was involved and why. The author also says who didn’t want to talk, which is important for being right and fair. The article talks about different people involved, which is good for fairness. Even though the story was big and got a lot of bad reactions, the author still shares what the accused lawyers think to show the whole story.

What makes this article special is that it talks about the victim’s family and what they think. The reporter says she spent a lot of time in Georgia to report on the killing and how important the guilty verdict is for the family. This shows respect and understanding. The article is about a Black man being killed, which shows diversity.

The article is fair because it shares what officials and people involved in the event say. The author gives facts and official statements. The family's thoughts are shown as opinions, which is good. This helps readers see the full picture without being unfair. The article is credible because it mentions specific people and when they said things.

This article is true because it matches with what everyone thinks. The news is based on facts and official decisions, not guesses. It doesn’t push different ideas. This article also follows the school of Stuart Mill, which looks at the result of an event. The value of the case for the family is seen as a big win for them.
