One of the big reasons for breast cancer growing is that it runs in families, making it a disease that is passed down genetically. If the patient's family members have had breast cancer before, there is a high chance that they might get a tumor too, even if they are young (Coleman & Tsongalis, 2016). Because one of the patient's family members had this sickness, it could happen to her too. Another important reason for getting cancer is having different illnesses in the chest area, like having lumps in the breasts. When these kinds of problems are around, unusual cells might start growing in the chest area (Tkaczuk et al., 2016). This could make them grow too much and raise the chances of getting worse sicknesses.

The hormone part also has a big effect on health. In this story, this part is very important because it has many details about the patient's life. Some of these are having the first baby after 30 years, not feeding the baby with breast milk, and using hormone pills for many years. This could lead to the patient's hormones getting messed up (Tkaczuk et al., 2016). That's why as time goes by, it becomes harder for the body to handle weird processes.

If someone has cancer in the early stage, it might not spread to other body parts. But if it spreads early and quickly, it shows that the cancer is very strong. There are many ways to find out about this, and it's important to do some of them to prevent future health issues. Checking the tissues under a microscope can show how strong the cancer is at the start. When breast cancer spreads, tests like CT scans or scintigraphy can show if there are other spots in the lungs, liver, bones, or brain. We should remember that in breast cancer, these spread parts can stay hidden for a long time, even five to ten years after the main tumor is taken out.
