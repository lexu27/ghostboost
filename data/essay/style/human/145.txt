Background
Both Christianity and postmodern relativism are about spirituality and how it affects people's lives. Christianity believes in a powerful God who controls everything in the world, deciding what happens in life. This impacts how Christians see God as all-powerful and everlasting (Lasair, 2020). Christians' beliefs come from the Bible, explaining the purpose and truth of life and how it affects healthcare. Trusting in a strong external force helps Christians reach a higher state for healthcare and other life situations.

Christians are more peaceful with life outcomes since they follow God's guidance in all decisions. They accept healthcare results more easily than non-believers because they believe God allows all fates, good or bad. Biblical principles guide their ethics, even in healthcare (Lasair, 2020). For example, Christians see abortion as killing an unborn child, so they don't agree with it. Therefore, healthcare choices in Christianity are based on the Bible.

Unlike Christianity, which sticks to clear biblical rules, postmodern relativism has a more open view on spirituality and ethics. Relativists believe there's no absolute truth about God or ethics (Garrett, 2018). This means all spiritual or ethical beliefs are valid, even if they contradict each other. They think it's important to consider different opinions and decisions in healthcare. Postmodern relativism supports diverse approaches to healthcare because medical professionals should accept various views from patients and families (Garrett, 2018). Ethics could change depending on the patient without affecting care quality.

Scientism
Scientism says that hard sciences, like physics and biology, offer the best scientific knowledge with genuine and absolute truths. These sciences rely on laws of nature and experiments to give reliable results based on testable data. Soft sciences are seen as less valuable because their ideas can change and aren't as factual (Vukov, 2021). Scientism aims to show that hard sciences provide more important knowledge. Soft sciences, with their subjectivity, can lead to conflicting ideas on the same topics.

Some argue against scientism and its favoritism towards hard sciences. They say hard sciences also change with new information due to instruments and environmental fluctuations (Vukov, 2021). This means sciences can't give absolute facts since knowledge grows. Another argument is that hard sciences ignore personal opinions to rely on rationality. This approach limits new scientific discoveries since personal thoughts are crucial. Soft sciences might do better in finding new information because they support personal thoughts.

Worldview Questions
Ultimate Reality
Ultimate reality says people become who they are from their interactions with the world. They are shaped more by their environment than by nature. This includes family, schools, religious groups, community, and more. My family gave me values, schools and communities added to them. Growing up in a Christian family made me lean towards conservatism in topics like abortion and polygamy. However, education made me more open-minded to support abortion in certain cases and respect LGBTQ rights.

Nature of the Universe
The universe is always changing, relying on energy and processes like evolution, energy conversion, extinction, and competition. Humans must adapt and evolve to stay competitive. Technology advancements force us to evolve, like moving from cash to digital money. Those who don't adapt may struggle in the future.

Human Being
Humans are creatures with reason, created by God or evolved through science. Christians believe humans reflect God's image and must follow his purpose. My Christian belief aligns with this idea, seeing humans as stewards on earth.

Knowledge
Knowledge comes from learning or experience. Formal learning gives theoretical knowledge while experience gives practical skills. Knowledge improves our lives and is crucial for professionals like doctors, engineers, and teachers.

Basis of Ethics
Ethics come from culture, family, and society. My ethics are mostly shaped by culture but can be influenced by laws and workplace culture. Personal beliefs and values play a role too.

The Purpose of My Existence
My main purpose is to fulfill my creator's work on earth by being a good steward and caretaker. This involves caring for others and the environment, using resources to benefit everyone, and taking care of my health.
