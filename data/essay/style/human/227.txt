Feminist ethics is about saying women shouldn’t be seen as less important and that women’s good experiences are just as important as men’s. Vaughn (2019) says that feminist ethics have a few main goals. First, they talk about what’s right and wrong with how people treat women. The main aim is to find fair ways to stop bad actions and habits. In the end, the main goal of feminist ethics is to think of a good way that helps women get stronger. Feminist ideas about ethics came back in the late 1960s, first among regular people and then in schools, as part of a bigger comeback of feminist questions about what’s right and wrong. The first academic feminist thoughts talked about things like abortion, being fair and equal, housework, violence, and being forced to be straight. But the term ‘feminist ethics’ wasn’t used a lot until the late 1970s or early 1980s (Vaughn, 2019). Feminists thought that the old ethics was too focused on men and needed to be thought about in a new way.
Also, feminism is always thinking and talking about what’s right and wrong. According to Vaughn (2019), feminism is mostly about saying what’s right or wrong, and feminists themselves often question what it means. Not caring about women, ignoring their worries, not letting women make decisions, not valuing things that are seen as feminine, and not seeing women’s experiences as important are all problems feminists face. Putting women first, thinking women know best about what’s right, changing from male to female values, or learning straight from women’s experiences are all ways people have wrongly thought about feminist ethics. In the end, these wrong ideas are everywhere and not correct; feminist ethics are much bigger and more open than people think. To sum up, modern feminists are trying out new ways to think about what’s right and wrong that pay attention to their own specialness and shared worth, like how we’re all human, being fair, and treating everyone the same.
