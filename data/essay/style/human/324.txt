Treatment Options for Opioid Addiction
The best way to help with opioid addiction is called "substitution therapy." This means using a less addictive drug instead of heroin. Three drugs are used for this: methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone. Doctors choose carefully to avoid bad effects. Methadone can cause tough withdrawal if stopped suddenly. Doctors may give other medicines like tranquilizers or antidepressants. They also use supportive therapy. Patients need close care during tough times.

Supporting a Friend or Family Member with Opioid Addiction
Family support is key in helping someone fight addiction. Rehab centers are good for this. They have special programs to help people recover and live better without drugs. To help, doctors need to know about the addicted person’s life from family and friends. It’s important for motivation and treatment.
