Preventive health care is important because it helps people stay healthy and avoid getting sick. Lifestyle choices, where you live, and things you inherit from your family can all affect your health. Preventive care tries to deal with these things to stop diseases from happening. Ways to improve preventive care are being looked at, and there is a plan suggested that can be used in all healthcare places. Some ways have been studied and are talked about in current writings. For example, going for check-ups, using computer systems to help doctors make decisions, and talking to someone about how you think and act. These ways can be checked from a project view where the suggestions include using one big plan that includes all of them. So, the project is looked at in stages: starting, planning, doing, and checking/keeping an eye on things.
