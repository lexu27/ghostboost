The big company is PwC India, in India. They work on important things like the government, digital stuff, and tech advice. PwC India is at a good level in the global project management model (Naim et al., 2021). This is because they are very grown-up in their stage, which is the best in terms of how good they are at things. By using a global project plan, PwC India has got lots of benefits. First, they have changed and are making their processes much better. Second, they are doing more new and cool things. Naim, Alahmari & Rahim (2021) say that these new things have helped a lot with how well they do. Lastly, this plan has made their people better at doing complex stuff on time, which has made Indian people get more from their IT investments.

Since they are at the highest level in global projects, I think PwC India should get their workers more involved in managing things. This will help them deal with any problems that could happen (Naim et al., 2021). Also, because they are almost done, making things better all the time will help them stay strong for the next 2-5 years.
