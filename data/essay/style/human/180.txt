In recent years, computer technology has grown and helped many people and groups. Technology faces many problems as it grows a lot. The main problem is cyber-attack, where bad people target companies and people, causing big harm to technology users. Some bad things that show this are stealing information, malware, asking for money after attacking, and breaking into servers. These are big problems for technology users all over the world. People who know about cyber security help protect computers from these bad attacks.

In 2017, the world was shocked to see how bad the famous wanna-cry cyber-attack was on Microsoft Windows. The attack asked for money in Bitcoins to unlock the data of users. This made me want to work in technology to stop these bad things. Because all technology is at risk of cyber-attacks, we need to study cyber security to fix this issue.

When I was in school, I loved learning about computer programming, which made me interested in technology. I recently graduated from Electronic Engineering Technology and Computer Engineering Technology at Norfolk State University. I would love to study more about cyber security for a master's degree at the same university. Cyber security is important in today's digital world because it keeps personal and financial information safe.

Important topics in cyber security include big data analysis, cloud computing, digital investigations, cyber-psychology, wireless security, and social cyber security. Knowing about cyber security lets you use modern digital security tools in real life. Big companies are ready to pay a lot for cyber security experts who can protect their data, so studying cyber security is a good choice for a secure job.

A master's in cyber security will teach you how to keep networks and data safe from attacks. You will learn about different types of cyber security technologies and ways to protect information in organizations. You will also learn how to find weak points in networks and computers that could be used by attackers.

This program will also teach you about the legal, technical, and policy sides of cyber security, as well as network and computer system security. You will learn about how to design secure networks, assess security, and respond to security incidents. You will also learn about testing security measures and how to control access to data. With these skills, you can work in roles like security architect, Chief Information Security Officer, security assessor, and security manager. Jobs like Security Director, security engineer, and information security consultant also need cyber security skills and will be important in the future digital world.
