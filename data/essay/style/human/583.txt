This talk will focus on how three different news places tell about the 2022 Olympics in Beijing. The three stories were in Sports Illustrated, ESPN, and CNN. They talk about the end event of the Winter Olympics in Beijing. The Olympics are a big sports happening because it lets athletes from many states play and show their talent and skill. So, by looking at this event and how different news places write about it, we can see the different ways they report and different social and political views.

The first is Sports Illustrated, with the story named “How to Watch Winter Olympic Closing Ceremony: Live Stream, TV Channel, Start Time” by Carter (2022). Here, the writer talks about the Olympics’ clothes event, focusing on American athletes who won medals and will be there. They also say when and where to watch the event. This story talks a lot about the American team and the winners, like Elana Meyers Taylor.

The second story about the Winter Olympics end event is from ESPN. The writer is Hamilton (2022), and the title is “Winter Olympics 2022: Highlights from the closing ceremony in Beijing.” This piece is mostly about social media’s reaction to the games and their end event, shown in Picture 1. Hamilton (2022) also talks about the problems with these games because of the pandemic that is still affecting people. This story is more complex than the first one and covers more topics, like social and political things linked to the Olympics 2022.

The last news place that wrote about the end event of the 2022 Olympic Games is CNN. This story by the CNN team has less words and many pictures showing the final event. The title is “In pictures: The Olympics closing ceremony in Beijing” (2022), which tells us the focus is on the photos, not the words. One example is in Picture 3 above. Before showing the pictures, the writers say a bit about what the Olympics are, why they happen, the last Olympics that had problems because of the COVID-19, and other facts.

Numbers
The numbers back up different things linked to the Olympics and the world coming together. The 2022 Olympics were in Beijing, Yanqing, and Zhangjiakou with 12 places for sports. This let viewers and athletes see new spots and history they didn’t know about before. The games were watched by 24 companies that could show them. More than 300 others could also talk about the event, making the reports different. Over 1952 media staff were there, with 1491 from other countries. 520 news groups, and 602 photographers worked during the events. So, these numbers show how the world is part of big events like the Olympics. While news places have their own ideas and reports about their countries, they still play a part in the event.
