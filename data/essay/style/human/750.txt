Walmart is a big company that helps people all over the world for a long time. They have many shops, more than 15,000 around the world. But, the company has some problems because they don't give rewards to workers who do good work every day. This makes the workers unhappy and they don't work well. This is bad for the company because the workers are not happy. 
To fix this problem, Walmart should give rewards to workers who do good work. This will make the workers do better work. The company should also think about what the workers want and care about in their jobs. Walmart should improve the good things about working there to make people work harder. Overall, businesses work better when people are happy and motivated.
