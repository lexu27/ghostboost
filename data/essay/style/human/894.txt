With many people using smart phones, there is more data from these phones. The data is different based on some main ideas called the big data Vâ€™s. Most big companies like Microsoft, Amazon, and Yahoo have many places where they keep this data to help people quickly. They use Hadoop and SPARK to work with big amounts of data (Chaudhary et al., 2018). But, not many people look at the basic things needed to finish a job well in this area.

I think cloud tech helps fix a lot of problems with big data in business. It helps with not having enough space for data and makes things more flexible. Also, it is easier to save data in the cloud, making big data work better. Big data is really important for businesses. It helps find the right customers, do research, and get better results. Businesses can do things simpler by using big data. They can make smart choices based on good data, like if they should invest in something. This way, they can avoid bad investments. Since big data and cloud tech are very important, companies need to change their systems to match the needs of the market soon.
