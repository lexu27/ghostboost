The Prince book by Nicholas Machiavelli is very important for modern politics. It is different from old thoughts about politics that are more about perfect governments and cities. In this book, Machiavelli says that real politics deal with real people who may not always act morally. The main idea in "The Prince" is about kingship and how to stay in power. Machiavelli's book was a guide for politicians to be clever and selfish, which led to the term "Machiavellian". He talks about how a ruler should behave in different situations and says that the main goal of politics is to keep power. The book changed how people think about politics, as it focused on rulers being self-centered and aiming for their own success. The book says it's okay to do anything to achieve your goals.

Hobbes thinks people are selfish and want to gain for themselves. He says selfishness is the main reason people do things. Hobbes doesn't think people are bad by nature, but many think his ideas are too simple and not all actions are because of selfishness. Some people and groups give their time and money to help others without wanting anything in return. I think human nature is much more complicated than what Hobbes says about power-seeking people.
