Being a good market with many people who buy things, Canada has lots of chances for other countries to sell things there. One of these countries is the U.S. In this situation, selling farm products is a big part of all the trading. Canada is the U.S.'s second-biggest friend in this area, and they have good deals between them. This paper looks at Canada as a place to sell farm products, focusing on nuts and pistachios.

Sending farm products to Canada is well-controlled, which makes sure that the trading is safe and clear. Based on what the U.S. International Trade Administration says, Canada gets 15% of the U.S.'s farm products, worth $22 billion, mostly for people to buy. This way, Canada gets good things for its people, and the U.S. gets over 130,000 jobs. Since 1989, many American farm products can go to Canada without taxes under the NAFTA and U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement, now changed to the USMCA. Some products like dairy and eggs have special rules and are not part of the agreement, but pistachios can be sent without taxes. As per the rules, all packages must have a USMCA Certification of Origin along with the usual papers for sending things (Government of Canada). To make sure the people in Canada are safe, the country asks all sellers to show a Phytosanitary Certificate for plant things. This paper proves that the plants are safe from pests, follow Canada's health rules, and have been checked by the U.S.'s authorized group (Government of Canada). This helps keep the farm products safe. Because the trading is good, there has been a lot of trading between the U.S. and Canada. Nuts trading has been important, especially because of the different climates. Table 1 shows the farming and nut trading between the U.S. and Canada. Table 2 gives details about pistachios sent to Canada.

In general, Canada is still one of the U.S.'s top friends for trading, partly because the countries are close and have similar rules. They have good deals that help make trading easier and safer. Sending pistachios to Canada has big chances if the health rules are followed.
