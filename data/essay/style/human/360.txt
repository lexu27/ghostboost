Different situations where medical workers have worked made different kinds of leadership plans. For example, during COVID-19, clear talking and quick getting ready were shown as important by top healthcare leaders (Nicola et al., 2020). Another important thing is using outside helpers who help make good decisions in organizations (Alagoz et al., 2018). Also, one study said being positive and open-minded as a leader can help workers be stronger and happier, giving more energy (Wei et al., 2018). So, good healthcare leaders need to adapt to changes and talk well with their colleagues.
Many parts of a hospital can be managed by a healthcare boss. One is the part where patients stay which needs many skills. Also, the serious care and emergency sections need good managing and working together chances. As mentioned before, these healthcare areas need strong leaders to give the best care to patients. One way to make this better is to think about all the things outside and inside that affect it. Also, making decisions together is not bad for leading; it's a good idea in healthcare management.
Working together with other healthcare workers in hospitals is important for patients. Studies show big changes in healthcare after using this strategy (Spaulding et al., 2018). This way involves learning from others and using it in your work, asking for advice from other medical staff. So, this way changes what services workers can offer and should be improved for better use.
