The thing that makes people have a big gap between them at first is when they have different amounts of things like money and stuff. Now, the world is like two groups with people being in one of them based not only on how they look, act, or think but also on what they have. In every country, there are both rich and poor people, and sometimes there are a lot more poor ones. But everyone is the same and needs each other because they live together. Being devoted is very important for a person who thinks deeply and cares about others.

Understanding the Passage
The main point of the text is about being selfless and helpful, no matter how much money or nice things you have. According to Andrew Carnegie, if you have wealth, you should share it with those who need help. Everyone should see how they can help society as a whole. If rich people only care about getting richer and ignore poor people, society will become worse, and even the rich will suffer. Rich people should give some of their money to help the poor and use their skills to fight poverty.

Getting rich, especially without inheriting money, takes a lot of time and effort. But being rich doesn't always make you happy, and this realization often comes later. Many people who realize that money doesn't make them happy still find it hard to change their lifestyle. So, it's important to know what you really want. For example, Carnegie understood that money isn't the main goal but just something that comes with it. He saved enough money to have time for himself, not just chase wealth, but to live happily and peacefully.

In Summary
To sum up, achieving something good requires hard work and dedication. Some people can't have a good life because of different reasons. Carnegie worked hard, but he also got lucky with timing and opportunities. He understood that money alone doesn't bring happiness, and joy can come from simple acts of kindness and dedication.
