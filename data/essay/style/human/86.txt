Nowadays, asthma is very common in the USA and all over the world. The Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America (AAFA, 2021) says 25 million people in the country have asthma. People with asthma don't have it every day, but they usually have one serious problem every year. To understand this sickness, we need to talk about how asthma changes the body's normal processes.

Body Changes
Asthma mostly affects the lungs because the airways get narrow and people can't breathe well. One big change caused by asthma is bronchoconstriction. Sinyor and Perez (2021) say this means the airways quickly react to things that bother them. For example, if someone breathes in something they're allergic to, the muscles in their airways tighten and block the air (Sinyor & Perez, 2021). This is a common response to allergies or things like cold air or exercise. To stop this, you can avoid what triggers it or use epinephrine.

Another problem with asthma is airway edema. This is a more complicated issue for the person affected. It leads to more inflammation and mucus building up in the airways (Sinyor & Perez, 2021). These problems can change the structure of the airways and make it harder to stop bronchoconstriction. Sometimes, the airways stay blocked, causing a big problem in the long term. Also, being around allergens and triggers a lot can make the airways more sensitive, leading to stronger reactions to small amounts of allergens (Sinyor & Perez, 2021). Knowing about the body changes in asthma, we see that the sickness is about blockages in the airways and pressure in the lungs when you're exposed to something that bothers you. How bad the blockage is depends on how your body reacts and how much of the thing bothers you.

Signs and Symptoms
While asthma shows different reactions to allergens, most people with it share three main processes:
  * Swollen airways;
  * Blocked airways with mucus;
  * Tight muscles (AAFA, 2022).
These processes cause symptoms like trouble breathing, coughing, chest pain, and wheezing. Depending on how bad these symptoms are, patients should either see a doctor right away or use quick-relief medicines like EpiPen, or long-term medicines like corticosteroids. There are three main asthma zones: green, yellow, and red. People with asthma need to follow these zones and take the right medicine based on their symptoms.

Even though asthma can be hard to predict, common risk factors include having family members with asthma, allergies, getting serious lung infections as a kid, and working around irritants and chemicals. If someone feels short of breath, coughs, or has trouble breathing, they should see a doctor right away. Doctors can use tests like spirometry to detect asthma early and prevent asthma attacks.
