There is a bad effect from the opioid problem in the United States. These things can make people want more and more, and a big part of it is that they do not fix the real reason for the pain. Instead, they make you feel very happy which hides the pain. This is why it is clear that we should not allow heroin to be legal, and we should make other things to help with pain.
Because heroin and other opioids are very bad for the whole country, a good idea is to give money for other ways to help with pain. Some people think about using marijuana to help with pain, but it can also be bad for you, so we need to be careful about this (Saloner et al., 2018). But if doctors find a different way to help with pain, there will be many good things that happen. This will make patients safer because too much opioid can make people die (Saloner et al., 2018). For example, more than 60,000 people died from taking too much medicine in 2016 (Saloner et al., 2018). Also, it will save money because if we use a different way to help with pain, we won't need to give extra help to people. This is why it is very important to spend money on different ways to help with pain.
In the end, we know that the opioid problem is a big issue for the United States. This makes many people hurt and die, so we need to find other ways to help with pain. Marijuana can be good, but it can also be bad, which is why doctors are not using it yet. In any case, scientists should search for different ways to help with pain so that patients are safe and we spend less money on healthcare.
