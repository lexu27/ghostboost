Russia Today (RT) is well-known for telling news about many things, especially Ukraine. Some people say it tells news in a way that makes people see things differently. It follows rules in Russia and shares these ideas in other places through RT. This makes it seem like there isn't really freedom in the news, but more like it's controlled by politics. This paper looks at how RT talks about Ukraine based on a report by Hutchins about good journalism.

Hutchins talks about three problems for the news and media. First, new tools make it hard for many people to share their thoughts. This is seen in how RT works, where only some people can share news. RT mostly talks in favor of Russia and doesn't let other opinions be heard, limiting free speech. The second problem, according to Hutchins, is not giving the news people need, even when they can. RT talks about Ukraine in a way that makes Russia look good and Ukraine look bad, instead of being fair. People want fair news, but RT uses its power for spreading its own ideas. Lastly, the third problem is when news bosses use bad ways to tell stories. RT changes the truth to make itself look better, which is not good for journalism.

Hutchins thinks that if the government controls the news, it's easier for bad things to happen. Looking at RT and how it talks about Ukraine, it's clear that it spreads political ideas. All the problems Hutchins talks about can be seen in how RT works, showing that it's not a good place to get real news. So, based on this report and how RT talks about Ukraine, it seems like RT is not a reliable news source, but more like a tool for sharing the Russian government's ideas.
