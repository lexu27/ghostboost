The main book for this study is the general medical book The Lancet. It shares the survey facts and gives numbers and a comparing look at the numbers they got. The Economist can be like another book that talks about research with not so much digital stuff. The study says the number of girls in school getting HIV is going down because their families have money problems, but now it's better.
The World Bank gave money for the study to show how money can help stop HIV from spreading in poor young girls. Berk Ã–zler, who is the Lead Economist and Poverty Research Manager, wrote the study. The medical book The Lancet shared numbers from a survey in the Zomba district in Malawi (G.C. 2). The Economist then talked about the study and shared the most important facts.
So, there were 1,300 single girls from 13 to 22 in the study. This is enough girls to see how much HIV is in poor places. The girls were chosen by a computer to be in different groups by chance. One group got money each month, one group had to pay for school, and the last group got no money.
From the study, we can see that the girls who got money in both groups had less virus spreading. But the girls with no money had to find someone to give them money. So, in this group, the HIV numbers stayed the same. So, money is like a medicine that helps stop STDs from spreading. This means the whole world needs to give money to stop HIV. But helping young girls has some problems. First, we don't know how much money each person needs to not find sugar daddies and live better. Also, the study lasted 18 months, so we don't know if it will work long-term.
