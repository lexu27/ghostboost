In United States, each state has their own special laws about people moving to their place on top of big federal laws. Different places have different rules, some are harder and some are easier, because of many things like how many people live there, where it is, what people believe, what happened in the past, and the people who make the rules. The rules in the states decide how life is for people who move there, especially about school and money. Alabama and California have lots of people who moved there, but Alabama has stricter rules than California.

In Alabama, the rules about school for people who don't have papers are not nice compared to California. A new rule in Alabama makes schools check if kids have papers to be there, and this rule does not let kids without papers go to public schools. Even if the court stopped this rule, schools in Alabama are still not nice to kids without papers and don't let them have the same education as other kids.

California, on the other hand, does not follow big laws to make rules that help people without papers go to school. The state stops checking if kids have papers when they go to school. Also, California made a law called the Dream Act, which lets people without papers pay the same money for school as people born in America. This law helps people without papers pay less money for school and get other school money like other students. People without papers in California can also use different ways to show who they are during big school tests.

Alabama's strict school rules for people without papers might be because of the state autonomy idea. In this idea, the state wants to keep its own place safe from people who want to be separate because of where they come from. Alabama's leaders keep their power by not letting people without papers get good education. By stopping them from learning a lot, the state makes sure that people who are different will always need help from the people who are the same.

Pluralism, on the other hand, is why California is nice to people without papers in schools. Pluralism means that a country or state accepts that people are different in many ways. This idea lets people with different lives, thoughts, and interests live together. California's leaders support having different groups, even the smaller ones, by letting people without papers go to school like everyone else. This helps make sure that everyone has power in the state, not just some people.

Other things that make the rules different in the two states are how many people moved there, what their lives are like, what happened in the past, and who has power. Because of bad school rules in Alabama, people without papers there don't have a lot of money or good jobs like in California. Also, California has had more people moving there for a long time, while Alabama has not, so they are not used to people who are different. Lastly, people without papers in California can have power because there are a lot of them, but in Alabama, it is hard for them to be in charge because of the rules about getting an ID.

The rules about people moving to the two states changed how many people move there, with California getting more people and Alabama getting fewer. The hard rules in Alabama made fewer people come to live there, even though there was a chance for more people to move there in the past 20 years. But because of the new rules, it is not easy for people to go to school, have good health, or have enough money. This is why fewer people are moving to Alabama. Even though the state lets people marry who they want, the number of people who move there will probably go down in the future.

California started to get more people moving there in the 1970s, and the new rules made even more people come in. California has the most people who moved there in the United States, and the number is still growing. By having good rules, California helps people who move there to do well. Letting people marry who they want in 2008 also helped more people come to California. With more good rules for people without papers, more people will come to California in the future.

In the past, there was a case in the U.S. Supreme Court about a person who helped a slave owner get back their slave. The court said that the law in Pennsylvania was wrong because it punished the person who helped the owner. The court said that the U.S. Constitution says that slaves belong to their owners, and so the person was not wrong to help the owner get their slave back. This case made Pennsylvania change its law to let slave owners get their slaves back legally.

The lesson from this story is that the U.S. Constitution always helps the people who were there first, the Natives, more than people who came later. States have to follow big laws, and even if they make new laws to help new people, those laws might not work in big courts. In this story, the U.S. Constitution or big laws help Natives more. States want to help new people, but no matter what they do, new people will always feel unsure about big laws.

In conclusion, the hard rules about people moving to Alabama make it hard for new people to do well there. California, on the other hand, has good rules that help new people do well. The differences in rules between the two states come from how many new people are there, what happened in the past, who has power, and where they are. California will keep getting more new people coming in, while Alabama will get fewer because of the hard rules. The U.S. Constitution always helps Natives more, even though there are other groups in the country.
