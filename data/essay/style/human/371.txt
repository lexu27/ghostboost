The ideas to help against coronavirus, like what Iceland did, are interesting. Iceland's plan knows its limits, like how strong the community is and the strange geography. But now, this plan might not work for NATO countries with many infected people. It's right that fast action and lots of tests can help stop the bad effects of the quick rise in infected people. But it's also important that the people agree to do these tests. Even with help with money, some countries in NATO might not have enough money to do all the needed tests when the new infections come. This is important because the virus might spread in many places at the same time.

So, maybe we need a different way to fix the problem. Israel used a smart idea to watch infected people with a digital tool (Amit et al., 2020). This tool can find who might have met the infected people and take action (Amit et al., 2020). But this way might not work for NATO countries with big areas. It's hard for them to control all their borders. So, using digital tools could be a solution without needing strict border control, and it can help react fast to new outbreaks. But it will need money from inside and outside to make new or fix old systems for this.
