The project is about studying the painting Madonna Adoring the Child made in 1480 by Francesco Botticini. It's a great artwork from the old times showing Mama Mary and Baby Jesus. The colors used are simple, not too bright. The painting looks realistic, with the main characters in the middle. All lines are clear and many details are given to clothes and faces. The artist wanted to show how important Jesus is. In general, the picture fits the style of that time. Madonna Adoring the Child is a good example of art from the past, showing Mama Mary and Baby Jesus, like many other paintings from that time.
