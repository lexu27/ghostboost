Article Summary
The article “Anopheles stephensi Mosquitoes as Vectors of Plasmodium vivax and P. falciparum, Horn of Africa” by Chali et al. (2019) compared two kinds of mosquitoes, An. stephensi and An. arabiensis, to see which one gets sick more with Plasmodium falciparum and Vivax. The study happened in Ethiopia, where malaria happens a lot. They fed the mosquitoes blood with sickness for many days and checked if the mosquitoes got sick too. They looked at the tiny parts of the mosquitoes and checked who got sicker. They used a computer to look at the data. They found that An. stephensi mosquitoes were more likely to get sick with both Vivax and falciparum compared to An. arabiensis.

From the study, they found more An. stephensi baby mosquitoes in water. An. arabiensis mosquitoes ate more blood than An. stephensi, but An. stephensi got sicker with Vivax. An. stephensi also had more sickness in their belly than An. arabiensis. An. stephensi had more sickness in their mouth too. The study shows that An. stephensi is more dangerous for malaria in Ethiopia than An. arabiensis.
