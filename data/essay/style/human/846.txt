Love is not just a feeling but a big process that happens in the body and involves different things. The chapter "Biochemistry of love" by Carter & Porges talks about how love works in the body. The main ideas in the chapter are about oxytocin and vasopressin and how they make people feel close to each other.

Social behavior is part of how living things change over time, and even basic animals do it. Humans have many different social behaviors, and love is just one of them. Love starts in the brain, where special feelings go through a nerve called the vagus nerve. Oxytocin and vasopressin are important chemicals in this process. Oxytocin helps mothers and babies bond, but it can also make adults want to take care of babies. It also helps with eye contact and understanding others, which are important for love.

Research says oxytocin is not the only chemical that helps with love; vasopressin also plays a role. Vasopressin helps with being protective and fighting, and when it works with oxytocin, it helps keep a balance. Oxytocin can reduce stress, which helps kids when they are away from their moms.

The chapter also talks about how love affects a child's growth and how bad experiences when young can make men have more vasopressin and be more aggressive. Bad experiences can hurt a person's health on a genetic level. Men usually have more vasopressin when they feel threatened.

Getting enough oxytocin when young helps people love others. Being around others is important to keep oxytocin at the right level because being alone can make vasopressin increase. Oxytocin helps reduce stress and helps with healing. New studies show that oxytocin can also help people handle tough things better. After reading this chapter, I now know more about how hormones affect how we connect with others. Studying how oxytocin and vasopressin affect mental health could help make new treatments for people who went through tough times.

In the chapter "Biochemistry of love," Carter & Porges show how oxytocin and vasopressin are linked to human connections and love. Oxytocin helps make bonds and lowers stress, making it easier for people to love. Vasopressin is linked to being protective and is higher in men, which can make them more likely to be hurt and have problems on a genetic level.
