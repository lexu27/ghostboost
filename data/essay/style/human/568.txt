The making of how we see the world with others is a big thing that scientists look at now. Science grows to help us use what we know to make new things for people and nature. This is why we have social reality from tech stuff, and tech stuff from how we see things socially (Lancet, 2013). Social reality's shape, like how we show ourselves to others and how tech changes the world, is linked to making a new global way and putting it in place through worldwide moves. How we make social reality is tied to what we do, like making things and thoughts. We try to make plans that fit all when we make what we see as real. Seeing how we make social reality shows how we make things the same way and keep them as customs.

For sure, people change how they look to match what they want others to see. For instance, when they try to get a job, they might say they did things they didn't actually do. This can help them get the job they want. How people act with others is about how they affect each other back and forth. Everyone has to play lots of roles in life. They talk to different folks and groups every day (Fleming, 2006). It's rare to just be with one group, like family, all the time. At the same time, they could be part of a work team, public groups, and more. Being in many groups at once, they have a spot in each because of how they are with others. This helps them fit in and maybe get a job. But, everyone needs different ways to help them out, which means they have to change.
