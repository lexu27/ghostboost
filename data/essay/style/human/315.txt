The first time someone talks about being with a man in a special way is in an old book called Leviticus. It says not to be with a man like you would with a woman because it's really bad. Another person named Paul talks about men wanting to be with other men instead of women, and he thinks it's not good and they will get punished. When talking about men liking other men, the old writings talk about being together or wanting each other, but not about how people feel today about loving someone of the same gender. People have been in relationships with the same gender in different times and places. But the idea of being "into men" or "into women" as something you are from the start is new; people only started thinking about it in the late 1800s, which makes it hard to compare to how Christianity sees homosexuality. Another thing to think about is how old writings talk about men with men and men with women. In the past, people knew about being with the same gender, but they didn't see it as the same as being with someone from the other gender. In Christian places, they used to punish men who liked other men. In England, they kept punishing them until recent times; for a while, people who liked the same gender were targeted by the Inquisition. The laws in Byzantium were really strict and could even mean getting castrated or killed for being with the same gender. People believed in these punishments because of their strong religious beliefs. But they didn't see these relationships the same way we do now; it was seen as something wrong and not normal.
