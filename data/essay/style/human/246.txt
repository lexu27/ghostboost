Marketing is very important for all businesses. Organizations try to find good ways to get new customers. But, some marketing is not fair or right. It is not good to try to sell things to people who do not know a lot. These people might be kids, old people, or people with problems in their minds. It is not right to target them because it can be bad for them. 

There are many reasons why it is not good to target people who do not know a lot. First, these people might buy things they do not need because of the marketing. This can be like playing with their minds. Second, it is hard for them to know if a company is lying to them. So, they might buy things based on wrong information.

Some people say it is okay to target people who do not know a lot. They think these people can be new customers and companies can make money from them. But, these people need special care because they are easily influenced. That is why it is not right to target them.

To sum up, it is not good for companies to target kids, old people, or people with mental problems. Even if some think it is okay, it is best to avoid doing it. This is because these people might make bad decisions if they are targeted by marketing.
