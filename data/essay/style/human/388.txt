Delegation is very important for success in any group, but it can be a big problem in managing a church. Many leaders in church work alone and find it hard to think others can do tasks better. But as the church grows, it needs more help from staff or volunteers. When leaders do all the work alone, they waste energy on things not their job (Kouzes & Posner, 2017). This makes church leadership less effective, which is not good. This is even more urgent when leaders are young and not experienced. They might think they can do everything, but doing too much can stress them out fast. To solve this problem, it's best to have a plan that looks at the situation and makes smart decisions based on it.

Important people are senior pastors, church leaders like elders and deacons, and volunteer leaders who help with delegation. When giving tasks to others, it's important to explain clearly what's expected and what they need to do. The best way is to create a culture where leaders help and encourage others to join in.

Young leaders often do too much work. They like helping because it makes them feel important and trusted by the team. Inexperienced leaders don't leave time for important tasks because they get involved in everything. They might try to solve problems for their team, saying it's because they don't know how to do it. But this can lead to more problems. It's better to give tasks to someone who can do them with help from experienced team members.

Delegation means planning tasks and organizing work to reach goals quickly and well. Doing too much work can make managers tired, upset the team, or make them not focus well. Inexperienced leaders might end up doing the work themselves in the end. The diagram below shows why delegation problems happen (Figure 1).

Bad leadership costs companies money. For example, losing an employee can cost $5,500 (Bartram, 2019). In a company with 250 people, this can be $250,000 a year (Bartman, 2019). In a church, these numbers might not apply, but if leaders make mistakes, attendance can drop, and people might not be happy.

Using the 5 Whys method can help with delegation problems. Why do these problems happen? Because of bad management. Why do churches have bad management? Because employees are inexperienced and don't know key leadership ideas. Why is delegation important for churches? It helps manage better and lets leaders focus on urgent tasks. Why might churches not want to use this method? They might be scared to change how power works. Why is delegation still good? It helps churches work better and boosts young leaders' confidence.

Delegating tasks in the church is a skill every leader needs. It helps groups work better and lets others learn and grow with success. By delegating, leaders let others serve and use their skills. Good leaders get better results by asking different people to help them. Delegating creates space for teamwork and discussions. It needs effort and humility, as without these, there can't be a real dialogue. Delegation can make church work better and help young leaders who are still learning how to lead successfully.
