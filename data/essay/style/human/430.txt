Ancient Rome was very mixed with many different peoples from big lands that Roman Empire had. They took in local people and cultures. Romans had many different cultures inside and their people had diverse genes, more like Mediterranean places than Western Europe. Gauls, Greeks, Syrians, Egyptians, Lebanese, Persians, and more lived under Romans. Rome's success was partly because they accepted many different people and mixed their traditions with their own.
Pax Romana was a peaceful time for about 200 years when Rome stopped expanding and let different cultures live together. Rome did force some rules on conquered lands, but mostly people could do their own things like religion, traditions, laws, and taxes. Rome was one of the most mixed places in ancient times that respected others.
Ancient Greece had a big impact on Roman culture, especially in things like buildings, art, thoughts, and government. Romans admired Greeks and learned from them in science, writing, laws, money, and even war. Etruscans, who lived northwest of Rome, also influenced Romans. They traded a lot with Greeks and had similar cultures. Etruscans helped Greek culture come into Rome. In early days, Romans learned war from Etruscans and became a strong, expanding society.
