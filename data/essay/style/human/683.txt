Treating people is hard work, and even the best doctor cannot do it alone. Nurses are important in the medical system and in saving lives. Remembering my past, I think about events that led me to be a nurse. People's experiences shape them and affect their choices in life. My experiences helped me understand my calling. These moments in my life may seem normal, but for me, they were important and showed me that events are not just random.

Thinking about the problems people face, like global issues, has been on my mind since I was young. I wondered how things could be changed. I thought about changing the world, environmental protests, and creating technologies to help the ocean. But those things didn't seem right for me, and I wanted to do something practical and impactful. These thoughts were the main reason I became a nurse. Medicine and care make the world better. Without them, life wouldn't be as good as it is now. Helping even one patient is as important as changing the whole world.

Many of us have been sick or in the hospital as children. I had to stay in the hospital for a few days when I was young. I was scared, especially at night. But a nurse named Tina comforted me and made me feel better. She let me call her by her name and we became friends. I always remembered her with happiness, and when I grew up, I realized how important her actions were for a child. This experience was the second reason I became a nurse - I understood that many people need support like I did.

We have to deal with illnesses and accidents not only in hospitals but also in emergencies. Family, friends, and even strangers can suddenly get sick or hurt, and quick action is crucial. As a teenager, I saw my friend break his arm. We were lucky to have someone nearby who could help and the ambulance arrived fast. But for a few minutes, I felt lost â€“ I wanted to help but didn't know how. This event made me decide to become a nurse. Knowing first aid and helping with simple things like measuring blood pressure can save lives.

So, after thinking a lot and experiencing important events, I chose to become a nurse. I see many benefits in this job and believe in its importance. Helping people, saving lives, and giving comfort is what I want to do. Our world needs kindness, care, and support for the well-being of everyone.
