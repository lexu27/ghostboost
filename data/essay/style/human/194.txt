Diabetes type 1 usually happens because the body fights against the cells in the pancreas that help with insulin. This can go on for a long time without showing big problems. People with not enough insulin can’t use sugar in their muscles and fat. Then, the body makes hormones that work against insulin, like glucagon and adrenaline. These hormones make the liver do things like make more sugar and break down glycogen, which leads to high sugar in the blood and acid in the body. Type 2 diabetes is the most common disease in the endocrine system. It happens when the body doesn’t respond well to insulin. This makes it hard for tissues to take in sugar and stops the liver from making glycogen right. People with diabetes need to eat in a certain way and take their medicine with meals. Those with type 1 should eat foods like fruits, veggies, and whole grains. For type 2, foods like brown rice and veggies are good. Stay away from sugary foods and eat healthy. Type 1 diabetes needs Insulin Degludec with meals to prevent low sugar in adults. Zynquista is a pill to take with insulin. Type 2 people might also need insulin if diet and exercise don’t help. In that case, they can take Insulin Degludec or Metformin.
