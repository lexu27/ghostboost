Bowel sickness is when your tummy hurts a lot and your food tube gets big. Doctors do many tests like blood tests, poop tests, and looking at your insides with a tube and a light. They also look at your stomach and take small pieces for checking. Doctors want to make the sickness go away so you feel good. They give you different foods and drugs to help. Some drugs look like aspirin and help with the big tummy. Other drugs make your body's soldiers quiet. There are also drugs that stop the bad stuff in your blood. If none of these work, you can get other drugs through a tube or a needle.
