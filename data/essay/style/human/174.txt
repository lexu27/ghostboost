Many countries have many people from different places now. Doctors are seeing patients from various backgrounds. So, they need to talk and understand each other better. This is very important in healthcare because they talk about sickness, medicine, and keeping people alive. When doctors and patients don't know about each other's backgrounds, it can make patients unhappy, not follow the doctor's advice, and get sicker. (Purnell, 2002)
