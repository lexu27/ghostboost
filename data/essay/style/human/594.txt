Suicide is a big problem in society today. Many countries have this problem, even if they have different money, culture, or religion. Teenagers are at high risk of suicide (Button and Marsh 13). They may feel sad because of love problems, fights with friends or family, or school troubles. Stopping suicide is a big, hard problem in our world. It's about looking at why someone feels so bad and helping them, especially students who might be in danger.

When talking to a teenager who is thinking about suicide, teachers should do a few things. First, listen carefully because teens often feel very alone. Second, ask the right questions calmly to understand what's wrong. Third, don't argue or say their problems are small. Try to give the teen hope and show them they have strength. If a student seems like they might try suicide, these tips can help.

Listen carefully to the teen who wants to die and try to understand their problem. Check how serious their feelings are (Robinson et al. 6). If they have a plan to die, they need help right away. Also, see how bad their sadness is and watch for any sudden changes in behavior.

Even small problems matter. A teen might not talk about their feelings but could be very sad. Parents should encourage their child to share worries, not just successes (Kweon 167). Never make fun of a child for being weak. Instead, help and guide them to find solutions.

Preventing teenage suicide is different for everyone. Both teachers and parents should talk and listen to teens. Let them share their problems openly. If a teen feels safe to talk about their worries, they might not hurt themselves. Taking a teen's concerns seriously and showing care can help stop suicide. So, by taking action early, we can prevent teen suicide.
