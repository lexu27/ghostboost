I think social movements are not just sometimes using bad behaviors but are always bad. They start when things like voting and political groups cannot fix problems. Social movements help people say their ideas to leaders. By doing this, they make the normal way of voting in a democracy not work well because people don't always agree with the leaders they choose. This helps groups who are not treated fairly to talk and be listened to. This idea is good for all sides of politics, and it helps make democracy better. For example, the anti-globalization movement cares about different things - one side wants to protect the environment and workers, while the other side wants to protect their country and limit immigration. Social movements include many different people and make politics have more choices.
It is important to see that social movements being bad is different from the ways they act to get what they want. For instance, both the Civil Rights Movement and Black Lives Matter used bad ways to fight racism. The main difference is in what they say - while the Civil Rights Movement tried to get everyone involved, Black Lives Matter had trouble with including all people. Dr. Martin Luther King's words like "We Shall Overcome" brought in many people who were not Black, so maybe Black Lives Matter could do better by including everyone.
