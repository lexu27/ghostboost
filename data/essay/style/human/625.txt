The situation of Danovic v. Wagner is about Emina Danovic, who is an old lady without work, and Professor Graham Wagner. She says he made her feel bad and had many problems. What I find most important in this case is how it is. It seems like a lady who feels bad wants to do something bad because her needs were not met, but the professor told her clearly that he cannot meet her needs, and she said it was okay. So, the worst part of this case is the lady's behavior and what she wants. It doesn't show what the problem is and doesn't ask for help clearly ("Danovic v. Wagner," 2014). She just wants to do something bad to the professor for things he didn't do because she feels strong emotions or wants something from him that is not about his job.
I was surprised that this case was investigated by the court even though it didn't seem to be about money. From the lady's letter, it was clear that she didn't understand what she was doing and started it without respecting the court, only because she felt strong emotions that didn't make sense. Also, it was surprising that the professor didn't ask for help, even though he had more proof that the lady's actions affected his job, life, and mind. Another new thing for me was how detailed the investigation was about some things. For example, they proved the lady was not going to have a baby with tests from two doctors in Europe, but even if she was, it didn't matter because she didn't want the professor to pay for it. I also want to know more about "frivolous" and "vexatious" claims because I never heard these words before.
