It's important to know that sometimes people from one place can't understand people from another place because they have different ways of thinking. This is called ethnocentrism, where someone only thinks about their own culture. For instance, the book says: "Americans don't get it, but when American stores open in poorer countries, people get really excited" (Noah 188). I live in Canada and follow Canadian culture, but some people from other countries might not get why a regular fast food place opening is not a big deal. The book also talks about how people from the West are surprised when they see this, but it's because of how history played out with countries like Africa. Even though many think Canadians are too nice, it's not always true.
A cool part of the book is how some bad rulers are seen differently in other places because they aren't as important there, which happens with Canadian leaders too. The book says: "In Europe and America, Hitler is seen as really bad, but in Africa, he's just another leader from history" (Noah 196). Canada didn't have bad rulers like that, but some people from other places think our leaders are perfect and show true democracy. But that's not always true because they have power struggles and don't always do what's best for the country, especially in recent times.
