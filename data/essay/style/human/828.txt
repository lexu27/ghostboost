The messages sent by talking, body language, and voice tone told people about the speaker's problems. At first, words told about issues at work and life, which were important. The speaker showed a bit of worry about work issues with colleagues using words to share feelings. The voice's pitch, speed, and tone also gave more details about feelings. When asked about personal life, he talked faster and higher than when talking about work. For body language, his face showed happy feelings with smiles and open moves. When asked tough or personal things, he crossed arms, legs, touched his face, and looked away.

The messages from talking, body language, and voice were somewhat similar but also different at times. When talking about bad things at work, the speaker tried to be calm and think clearly. But he spoke quickly, had arms crossed, and kept changing his gaze. These signals showed discomfort or dishonesty. Usually, all communication ways were used together. For instance, when talking about personal life, he used more details, happy words, face expressions, high voice, and quick speech.

Not all messages are always understood clearly since reading others is complex. It needs lots of practice to see patterns and get nonverbal messages. Different expressions, body moves, and voice changes can mean various things depending on the situation. So, it's important to look at all details and factors to have good communication.
