In 2020, FASB made a new rule (ASU) 2020-05 that delayed the start time of Topic 606 and Topic 842 by one year. This rule helped private companies, but they still faced many problems due to COVID-19. Some companies had trouble using the new money rules, different from the old rules (GAAP), because the new rules don't explain everything clearly. Private companies in all areas have problems with recognizing money. They must wait to record money until they finish their work, so they can't show costs right away. Also, they had trouble with guessing how much they would earn and changing contract values. Before the new rule, they couldn't show money based on a promise. Now, they have to share more details.
Most companies are ready for the new rules about leases, but they have some issues with Topic 842. They need to find hidden leases, make sure all lease data is correct, and make the same rules for new leases, renewals, and changes to tell everyone in time. Like with money rules, lease rules are now more detailed and may change how investors make decisions.
