Marijuana is an old plant used for many years in different ways. In the past, a professor named Oâ€™Shaughnessy learned about its medical uses in India. He used it to help patients with rabies, epilepsy, and tetanus after testing it. Experts have had different opinions over the years on whether it is good or bad. Some evidence shows it helps, while some just talk about it. Even though patients like it, we should remember it can change how the mind works and should be used carefully. The laws about it are unclear in many places.

Different Parts of Medical Cannabis
The plant Cannabis sativa has more than 100 parts, including terpenes, flavonoids, and important cannabinoids for medicine. The main cannabinoid is delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which can make you feel good. Another common one is cannabidiol (CBD), which does not make you feel different. THC and CBD are the most studied. Other parts of cannabis might also help medically, and they might work better together.

Ideas About Making Medical Cannabis Legal
People who do not like marijuana being legal for medicine say it could cause more drug problems. They think it could lead to mental issues and affect memory. They are worried that it might be harmful even though some say it is not. They also think it will make it hard for the police to control its use.

Studies show that young people who use marijuana feel worried and do worse in school. Colorado was the first place to make marijuana legal in 2012. Scientists there found that more people ended up in hospitals because of marijuana after it became legal.

Supporters of making marijuana legal say it can help with pain relief for different illnesses. They also talk about other countries where marijuana is not banned, and it has helped stop illegal drug trade. Studies have found that crime went down in places where marijuana was made legal.

Uruguay and Canada were the first to allow marijuana use in 2001. People over 18 can smoke it in special places. Some places let you have a few marijuana plants at home for personal use. In some US states, fewer people needed drug treatment after marijuana became legal. Police had more time to work on serious crimes and prevent crime. The use of other drugs did not go up, and less alcohol was consumed.

But there are bad things about making marijuana legal too. Some doctors say it should only be sold to people over 25. They believe young people could have problems with thinking, memory, and mental health if they use marijuana. It might also make mental illness worse for some people.
