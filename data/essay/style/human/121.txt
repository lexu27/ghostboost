Recent popular diets say that eating carbs is bad. But many people disagree for a few reasons. First, to have a good body that works well, you need different things like fats, proteins, carbs, and water (Nazario). Carbs change into important energy for the brain and nervous system, and help with breaking down proteins and fats. If you don’t have these, you might feel tired a lot and get sad.
Also, if you stop eating carbs, you might gain weight because when you start eating them again after not having any, your body stores a lot of it. You might crave more carbs and absorb them more (Nazario). For instance, someone who stopped eating carbs for a month lost weight but gained it back quickly when they started eating carbs again. 
And even just one day without carbs might make you feel sick and get a headache (Nazario). If this continues, you might get headaches often and even migraines.
Lastly, carbs are very important for the brain to work well. When you don’t have enough carbs, your brain doesn’t work as well, and you might find it hard to focus. Using ketones instead of glucose all the time can hurt how your brain works. So, it’s important to eat carbs to keep your body working right.
