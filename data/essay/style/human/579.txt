Software stealing, also known as piracy, is when someone takes software that is protected by law. This can make it risky for people and society because it can cause problems like glitches and bugs, which can make users frustrated and waste their time and work (Parson, n.d.). Another problem is that when people use stolen software, there are no guarantees, so they might get viruses that can harm their computers (Parson, n.d.). Also, using stolen software can get people in trouble with the law. This can hurt the companies that make the software because they lose money when people don't buy their software legally. Companies that follow the law are forced to share their work illegally with others (Parson, n.d.). Additionally, when companies outside the software industry steal software to save money, the software companies lose lots of money every year.

In America, people who want to watch illegal stuff can find many websites where they can watch stolen videos. According to Viaccess.orca, Stout (2021) found that in 2021, 23 million people from 9 million American homes watched stolen IPTV. It is estimated that by 2023, the stolen video services from people who don't pay for TV will be worth more than $67 billion (Stout, 2021). To stop this kind of stealing, one good way is to remove the reasons that make people want to watch stolen content. Other ways to fight against stealing are through public relations and education, where people learn that stealing is wrong, and through legal actions and enforcement, where steps are taken to stop stolen content (Stout, 2021). Other ways to fight stealing include working together, using technology and operations, and making it harder for people to steal.
