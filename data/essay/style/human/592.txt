Introduction
A new and smart house system is one of the special technologies that many clever systems use: Ecobee Smart Thermostat – a clever design with software to manage energy use. The device is medium-sized and has two parts: the thermostat with a glass screen, a strong processor, and SmartSensor that senses the environment. The thermostat sends digital data to the user and can work with small details and the user's device. SmartSensor has air sensors (temperature, wetness, closeness, and if someone is there) and a voice helper; it is managed by the thermostat and has microphones, speakers, and voice understanding. Ecobee Smart Thermostat keeps the house at a good temperature and wetness. The system helps to save money on energy and control the house's environment. The report talks about how the thermostat parts are made, how they work together, and how they are managed.
A Detailed Description of the Object
Thermostat
The thermostat is the main part of a quite big device that controls a clever system with sensors. This part can change the signal from the sensor using a strong processor and save the data on a memory card. The new Cortex A35 processor lets it work well using little energy. You can see the processor plan in figure 1.

Because the processor is good with energy, the thermostat can work without being online for a long time. The strong process helps it connect with other house parts like lights, heat pumps, wetness machines, fans, and phones. The small RAM, which saves the running machine's code, is enough for the device to work fast. The memory is 4 gigabytes, but this amount is enough for the user's settings. The thermostat uses Wi-Fi or Bluetooth 5.0 to connect. The Wi-Fi settings can be up to 5 GHz, with a chance to have an IP address, and the device can have a fixed or moving identifier on the network (DHCP).
Thermostat Connection
The thermostat has a box with parts to connect with the house's systems and a glass screen to show the data. The box is 6.2 inches by 6.2 inches, and the screen is 4.29 inches by 4.29 inches – small enough to fit anywhere. There is a hole in the box to put cables for the house parts that need to be managed: power, fans, and cleaning systems. Figure 2 shows the parts under the screen.

There are wire points like Rh, C, Y1 and Y2, PEK, O/B, and more. The AC is connected with 24 V using the C and Kc points, giving up to 3.5 VA of power. After connecting all the wires, the device should be turned on to set the internal settings to manage the connected systems. The screen shows details like date, time, place, wetness, temperature, and energy used. The data the user wants can be sent to phones or other devices when needed. All settings can be changed according to what the user wants.
Smart Sensor with Voice Control
Another part of the Ecobee Smart Thermostat is a small part with temperature and movement sensors. The sensor knows voice orders and works with Siri, Alexa, and other voice helpers. The sensor is small (1.6 inches by 2 inches) and is made of plastic and metal. Figure 3 shows the sensor from two views.

The sensor can be put anywhere in the house but 20 feet away from the thermostat. It sends signals using 915 MHz radio waves. The sensors can see up to 140 degrees from side to side and 100 degrees up and down. The sensors know the room's temperature by using a chip that feels heat. When something warm passes by, the sensor sends a signal to the thermostat. The signals help the device know if it needs to heat or cool the room. The sensor works with a CR-2477 battery that comes with it.
Conclusion
Ecobee Smart Thermostat is a smart device that lets you manage the room's temperature and wetness and see how much energy the house uses. The device has a thermostat with a screen and a place for a network in the box, and a SmartSensor with sensors and a voice understanding system. This system helps to check the house's main system – power, and because of the strong processors and the good battery, the user can save money.
