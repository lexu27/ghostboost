A caster is like a simple wheel that helps things move easier. It has parts like a metal base, vertical supports, screws, bushing, axle, and a wheel. These parts work together to make sure the caster can move things without any problems. The base is made of strong metal and is heavy. It holds everything together and should be put on a flat surface. The vertical supports are also strong and hold the wheel in place. They are attached to the base with screws. The screws are important to keep everything stable. There are also bushings that help the wheel spin smoothly. They are made of a special metal and reduce friction. The axle is like the center of the wheel that helps it spin. It is made of strong steel. The wheel is the last part and is heavy. It goes between the vertical supports and spins on the axle. Together, all these parts help things move easily.
