There are many things that help make the P-O-L-C framework work well. It's important to focus on some of these when a company has big problems, or when the market shows there will be tough times ahead. The WorldCom company broke down in 2002, causing one of the biggest money scandals in the US. This shows how bad communication in a business can be a problem. The boss of WorldCom, Bernard Ebbers, made the company grow fast by taking advantage of the interest in telecom services at the time. But, the company went broke in just a few years. Also, Ebbers got in trouble for things like planning with others to do bad things, lying about the company's money, and making false statements to the authorities. Because most of Ebbers' money was in WorldCom stocks, and he also got lots of loans from the company, people looked closely at what he did. The big bosses of the company faced many accusations and started blaming each other. Ebbers and his helpers said they didn't know about the bad plans. A study by Knecht in 2020 found that about 80% of workers feel like their ideas don't matter. So, the main reason for the telecom company falling apart was the bad communication inside. The problems with communication between Ebbers, bosses, and accountants came from things like not being clear about why they were doing things and only caring about themselves. The top workers who were supposed to lead the company mostly thought of themselves and only paid attention to the information that was good for them. This way of thinking made the company fall apart in the end, because they didn't work well as a team.
