There are many cases in the US about kids who do bad things and then need to go to the big court for grown-ups. Almost half of the states in the US let kids be treated like grown-ups in court. One state, Pennsylvania, doesn't have a youngest age for making kids face trial in adult court for killing someone. In 2009, a case with a double murder showed many problems like in other cases.
In February 2009, police found Kenzie Houk, who was 26 years old and had a baby in her belly, in her bed with a bullet in her head. Jordan Brown, the son of the lady's boyfriend, is very young to be blamed for murder. According to Heide (2021), the number of kids being arrested for murder in the US went up a lot from 1984 to 1993, and experts thought there would be more violence. People have tried different ways to stop kids from being violent, but nothing has worked really well.
Many things need to be thought about to understand why this problem is so big in the US. We need to look closely at how good the programs and places that try to stop kids from doing crimes are. We also need to talk a lot about how we can stop kids from doing bad things again after they already did something wrong. To find the best ways to help all the states, we need to think about many ways that work and have proof they help.
