The Romans had big influence on Greek areas. This topic is very interesting and many people are studying it now. The two cultures mixed in different ways and at different places. Where Romans lived, they shared their culture with Greeks. One important thing they shared was names. People think the names spread because of connections and personal identity. Rizakis (2019) talks about Greeks learning Roman naming and Greeks taking Roman names. This helped in creating a common naming culture. This mixing increased a lot in the 2nd century AD. Different cities and people from different classes accepted this new culture in their own ways.
Rich and powerful people played a big role in spreading this culture as they wanted their influence to be known through their names. Tria nomina, which was used a lot during the Roman Empire, was seen as something to be proud of. Some names became popular and were seen as part of shared culture, even by common people, although they didn't know the original meaning.
But the time when Roman names were very important was short. By the end of the 3rd century AD, people started using a mix of Greek and Roman names to show their identity. This was not common at first, but later it became popular in all Roman provinces. This change happened because Christianity grew and the Roman Empire declined. It was like going back to Greek naming tradition.
