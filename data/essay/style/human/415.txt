Melanoma is a cancer that covers more, but found early. Before, treatment was not many, but now better with immune help. People in stage II and III can feel better longer. New treatments give hope to many.
Changes in melanoma treatment use immune help and extra therapy. Recent studies show better survival with new treatments. Patients with low risk can stay well after special treatments.
Patients in remission should stay healthy with extra treatments. Before, some treatments were not good because they made patients sick. Doctors didn't trust them. But now, extra treatments are known to work well. Maybe Mr. B could have stayed in stage I with extra help.
