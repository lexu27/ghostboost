Studying the books from different smart people can teach us new things about old times. These books can also tell us what people think about important things like love, friends, and faith. So, Søren Kierkegaard, in his book “Fear and Trembling,” talks about his special idea of religion, which is not like what most people believe. This book talks about faith and how it connects to being good and thinking well in the work of the Danish thinker.

In this book, Kierkegaard tries to explain what faith really means for people. With his books, the thinker added new ideas to religion, thinking, and stories (Noble, 2017). Also, in his stories, the writer showed old Bible people in a new way to show they are still important today. According to the Danish thinker, Christianity has things that confuse the mind (“Søren Kierkegaard,” 2017). One big confusing thing is that the God who lives forever can also be a human with a short life. Søren Kierkegaard said that being good is only important if God says so. This is different from regular Christian belief, where it is important to be nice to everyone.

To finish, this paper looked at Søren Kierkegaard’s book “Fear and Trembling.” One special thing about this book is that it has a different idea about being good and thinking well. Also, one different thing from usual faith is that the thinker thinks if someone chooses to believe, they should still think. Actually, the writer thought people should believe in things that seem silly.
