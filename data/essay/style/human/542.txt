From business view, risk management means checking, thinking, and lessening risk in a company. It's seen as a big idea in managing, but in today's business world, accounting is very into avoiding risk. The main idea in accounting is risk management, and accountants should be experts in risk to help their company reach goals and deal with unsure things. Accountants give important info to managers for making good choices at all levels (Camilleri & Camilleri, 2017). Accounting helps a lot in success, working with managers to make good choices, handle risk, and reach big goals.

Risk management is about seeing, studying, and dealing with risk. Risk can be counted in numbers and is tied to how much profit you get back. Even if risk seems bad, it's needed to do well. In simple terms in accounting, risk is when things don't go as planned (Camilleri & Camilleri, 2017). Accountants always try to lower risk by using numbers like standard deviation, distributions, and spreads. Looking at risk with numbers helps make smart choices about risk.

Risk has always been about possible danger or loss. In accounting, risk is seen through decision trees, chance numbers, and pricing models. Risk management helps to carefully handle risk in work and reach goals. Good risk management looks at, studies, solves, and reports on risk. A more detailed risk management way tries to match risk with business plans and make risk part of work (Collier et al., 2006).

Risk is split into groups to make it easier to understand and compare. Risk is always there, so accountants know that some risk is okay, but they need to think about trade-offs and costs. Sorting risks can be helpful, but each place might do it differently.
1. Market risk – changes in the market where the company works.
2. Credit risk – risk when giving credit to customers or getting credit from suppliers.
3. Liquidity risk – having enough cash to pay bills.
4. Operational risk – problems from daily business like lawsuits or fraud (Camilleri & Camilleri, 2017).

Accountants help with controlling risk in a company. It's a big part of accounting to check and make rules for risk in a company. Accountants make sure everyone knows the rules for finances. They make the rules and put them in place (Needles et al., 2014). Accountants help make choices about risk and handle risk in work.

Accountants do best with risk when they understand how risk works in a company. Companies that plan for risk tend to do better and can keep working even when things go wrong. Many companies only act when things break, but it's better to plan ahead. To do this well, companies need accountants who can see and handle risk in all forms. But for this to work, risk plans must match business plans. Accountants know a lot about money and can work with different parts of a company to see all kinds of risks and make a full risk plan (Thompson, 2020).

ERM became popular after the 2008 crisis. It helps companies deal with big problems and makes financial info better for companies using ERM. Accounting quality means having good financial info for making good choices. It helps companies avoid bad money moves and gives good info on money. ERM is popular because it helps companies report right, manage risk, and have good accounting. So, accounting and ERM help each other out. Accounting is very important for ERM and makes ERM better by improving financial reports and how things work inside a company (Olayinka et al., 2019).

Good management is based on handling risk well. To do this, companies need to make good choices about risk and make sure everything works together. Risk is part of making good plans, so companies need to use info about risk to make good choices in business.

Accounting helps companies by giving info to the right people. This info helps people do their jobs well and manage risks in work. Good info helps make work easier and deal with risk. But sometimes, companies don't use this info well and things can go wrong. Some companies don't even look at the info, or they change it to look good. This can cause big problems (Van der Poll & Mthiyane, 2018).

Some companies only think about risks after they happen, but it's better to plan for risks before they happen. Accountants can help companies see risks, plan for them, and deal with them. Accountants know a lot about rules, talk to top bosses, and can help people make good choices. Accountants help with lots of risk work to make sure things go well in a company (Bento et al., 2018).

Accountants are learning new ways to handle risk every day. They know how to see, report, and study how choices affect money. Accountants can make new risk systems that work well and help decision-makers. This is because accounting is about more than just looking at past money and making plans. It's about looking ahead and making sure a company can keep going (Bento et al., 2018).

New tech is changing how companies work with money. Blockchain and fintech are changing how companies do business and make choices. But new tech also brings new risks. Accountants and ERM will help companies deal with these new risks. Accountants will need to look closely at new tech to see how it affects money and how to report on it. This will change how accounting works and how companies plan for risks in the future (Smith & Castonguay, 2019).

Fintech is growing fast and will change a lot about how companies work with money. It will make things faster and easier, but also bring new risks. Accountants will need to learn how to deal with this new tech and help companies work better. This will change how accounting is done and help companies plan for new risks (Smith & Castonguay, 2019).

The Bible talks a lot about faith and trust, but it also talks about planning and being smart with money. Jesus said to think before acting, just like companies need to plan before making big choices. This means being ready for what might happen and thinking ahead. This is important for risk management and how companies handle money and risks (New International Version, 2011).

Accounting is key for understanding how a company is doing, what risks it faces, and giving the right info to bosses.
