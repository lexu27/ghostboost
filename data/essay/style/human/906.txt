When we talk about making things last a long time, reliability design is a part of how we plan things to work well. Reliability means how well something can work under certain conditions for a specific time. It's connected to dependability, which is about how good something can work at a certain time or period. Reliability is important for things like quality, testability, repair, and progress. How well parts work can affect how much money a system costs. For example, if cars don't break often, they can be sold for more money later. But making things last a long time can be hard because things can be complex and fail unexpectedly.

To make things really strong, we need to design them with extra strength in mind. If a product is light, cheap, and works well, it has to be tough in its design. There's no room for mistakes when we make products. Users need to know how to use a product and what it can do for them. Predicting how long a product will last is important. We need to focus on setting goals and measuring how well a product works. Even small changes in how products are made or used can affect how well they perform. So, we need to keep learning from past mistakes to make products better.

Sometimes products fail without a clear reason. This can happen when people don't use products the right way. For example, if a product is used too much, it can break easily. Or if a product is used in a way it wasn't meant to, it can also fail.
