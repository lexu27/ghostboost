The Emergency

A big problem is a time or a happening that might cause a scary or an unsteady situation that makes a person, a group, or a community upset. It is a bad change in nature or human things, especially when it comes all of a sudden, with a little or no warning. A crisis can look different: being stolen from, hurt, or bothered, facing death or sickness, or even losing a job. Sometimes, it can be caused by inside stress like feeling very sad with bad self-talk. The crisis needs oneâ€™s focus; so asking for help helps one deal with a lot of problems they may not have thought about. Getting help early can really make one better at dealing with what happened and its impact on their life. When the COVID-19 sickness spread, I was in a big money crisis that made me ask for help quickly from some companies and people to come into my situation.

A Big Problem
The COVID-19 sickness was a fast disaster that shocked every person and they were not ready. I am one of the people who were hurt by the sickness in lots of ways. I worked in a store as a person who takes money, and my life was going well since I got some money to help my family. Even though I got money often from the job, I did not think about saving or putting some of the money into something that will grow. I also used the money to pay for my school since I went to school part-time near me. I had never been in a money crisis before, so I did not think something like that could happen to me.

When the COVID sickness started, the government made strict rules for businesses, like making hotels and restaurants close to stop people from being close to each other. The rules were to stop the sickness from spreading and many people lost their jobs suddenly with no warning. I lost my job without expecting it, with no savings, no way to grow my money, or any other way to get money, and I was the one who earned money for my family. So, that made me very sad since I did not know what to do next, and everyone was looking at me to help.

First, I thought the COVID sickness would not last long, so I did not think I would be out of work for a long time. But, the disaster went on every day with no signs of stopping, and one day it hit my family. My parents got sick with the sickness, and later, I got sick too. That was the worst time of my life since I had to get medicine for them and me even though I did not have money. I had to ask friends for help until they could not help more since the medicine was getting expensive. I could not take it anymore and decided to ask for help from agencies since my whole family was in a bad state. I asked for help from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. They helped my family get the needed medicine and gave us money for a while until I got better.

Ending
A big problem can be in different ways, like a money problem, and can come at any time no matter how much money one has. So, it needs quick help by asking agencies, friends, or family members. In cases like mine, it is very important to ask for any kind of help. If one does not get help quickly after going through a big problem, feeling upset may last long and lead to making bad choices.
