This bag is great for moms with big kids who are always busy but want to look nice while running errands and doing stuff with family. It's fancy but strong and helps keep your stuff neat and safe, so you can get out quick.
Choosing the Right Bag
A study shows that most people like Channel, Pucci, and Kate Shade bags. So, they can't decide between good quality bags for a fair price or really expensive luxury bags. To make the expensive bag worth it, using good leather and more pockets for storage could help because most fancy bags don't have that. Since people like shoulder bags or totes, adding a shoulder strap can make the price fair. People usually have 3-5 bags and want one that's good for everything, not many different ones. So, the best choice is a black bag that's 9x11 inches, made of leather, and costs 36$ to make.
Pricing
The study says most people can pay 300$-700$, and they like buying bags online. So, a mid-range price that's not too high or too low would be best. A good option is the Ralph Lauren Carlyle Mini Leather Zip Tote Bag that costs 195$. So, setting the new bag's price at 250$ would be fair for its quality. This price would also bring in more money for Buhi, which they can use for extras like accessories and fancy packaging to make the bag feel more luxurious.
