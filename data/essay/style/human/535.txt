Creating a law for ages is super important for the people who make laws in America. By making clear lines between being a child, a young person, and an adult, they can understand better the specifics of these times and the things people might do. But, Scott (2000) in his book The Legal Construction of Adolescence talks about how it can be hard to decide when childhood ends and adolescence starts. It's easier to say when someone is a child or an adult by looking at how safe children need to be and how responsible adults should be. But, figuring out when someone is a teenager is harder because it's a time of change.

Right now, the law doesn’t really say what being a teenager means. But, not saying it is a good way to not make things more confusing with a new idea. So, most times, they just look at the age of majority to decide how to treat teenagers (Scott, 2000). This means that anyone under 18 is seen as a minor, so they don’t have to think about each person's differences.

But, this way of thinking doesn’t think about all the things that can make someone mature or not. Because people develop differently and have different abilities and environments, some teens can be more like adults before or after 18. This means that the law might not work for all teens, and they have to treat everyone under 18 as a minor, even if they are ready to be adults (Scott, 2000). Scott also says that it's really hard for lawmakers to think about all the things that affect maturity.
