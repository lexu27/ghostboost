One important thing that can affect what food people buy is not having healthy options. When I go to Wal-Mart in Forest Part, I can learn about what they sell and how much it costs. For instance, a big bottle of milk is $2.65, a bread loaf costs $2.44, a bag of apples is $3.58, and a bag of baby carrots is $3.88. Also, there is yogurt for $1.92, Pepsi Soda for $1.98, some chips for $2.84, and a big pack of cookies for $3.98. In Maywood, IL 60153, most people are African American (68.6%), but some are white (18.2%) or Hispanic/Latino (26.9%) (United States Census Bureau, n.d.). Many people there can't find good food in stores but have more fast-food places now. This means they can't get healthy food and might get sick with problems like high blood pressure and diabetes.

Another thing that affects health and shopping is that some people can't go to Wal-Mart often because of money problems. The average income in the area is about $50,176, and 15% of people are poor (United States Census Bureau, n.d.). This means not everyone can go to good stores and buy healthy food without getting sick. Things like transportation, low money, and food are very important for everyone's health (Islam, 2019). We need to not just see the problem but also find ways to help make things better for everyone.

A nurse who cares about community health (CHN) has a job to help people stay healthy and choose good ways to solve food problems. Schffer and Strohschein (2019) talk about 17 ways to help in five groups with different colors, and working together is a good chance for everyone to stay healthy. This way of helping needs a lot of work, teamwork, and clear goals (Schffer & Strohschein, 2019). When we all work together, the nurse can talk to everyone who needs help, the community can see what's happening now, and families can get better information and be more involved.
