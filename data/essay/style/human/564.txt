It is important to say that drivers should not use phones when they stop at red lights. Driving needs focus, so any distraction is not good. Phones take attention away, so drivers forget about the road and lights. Therefore, phones should not be used by drivers because they need to pay attention even at red lights.

Red lights are important for safety and traffic flow, especially at crossings. Georgia made a law that says drivers cannot hold phones while driving. There are some exceptions like calling for accidents or emergencies. But red lights are still important for safety, so drivers should pay attention. Research shows that using phones while driving can make drivers slow to react to changes in lights, causing delays and traffic jams.

To sum up, drivers should not use phones at red lights because they need to stay focused even when stopped. Slow reactions can lead to traffic problems and accidents. Not all drivers will react at the same time to light changes, making things more risky.
