Out of many ways slaves fight back, the one that hurt masters the most is when slaves fight back with weapons and plans. The big reason is that even when slaves lost in America, the big fight in Haiti showed that slaves will always say no to slavery. A common way slaves fight back is by breaking tools, pretending to be sick, and working slowly. But these ways didn't work well because they only made masters talk more and get more benefits. Besides breaking things, stealing was another way slaves fight back, taking things for themselves. This happened because slaves lived badly, especially with food, so they stole food the most. It's important to remember that slaves thought stealing was okay because they were owned by masters, so how can a thing steal from its owner?

Unlike the ways slaves fought every day, running away was a clear fight. But it didn't work well because it made masters watch more and punish harder. Running away was dangerous with low chances of success and didn't make a big change. Also, mostly men could run away successfully. So, the best way slaves fought back and hurt masters the most was with weapons, like in Haiti. Even though Haiti was the only big win, the important thing wasn't winning. The big idea was that slavery will always be fought against by slaves, and Haiti was a big warning to masters that they can't have slaves forever.
