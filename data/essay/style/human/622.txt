As of 2nd March 3, 2022, many people have died from COVID-19 around the world. The numbers are very big, like 437,333,859 and 5,960,972 people. In the United States, many people got sick from COVID-19, like over 79 million cases. Also, almost 952,000 people have died. In other places like the United Kingdom, India, Brazil, and France, many people got sick too, like 19M, 42.9M, 28.8M, and 22.2M cases. Some countries had many deaths too, like India, Brazil, France, and the United Kingdom with 514,000, 650,000, 136,000, and 162,000 deaths.
In Africa and other places, COVID-19 is spreading a lot. In Kenya, there are 323,000 cases and 5,639 deaths. Half of the people who died are from developing countries. Many vaccines have been given to people around the world, like 10.7 billion doses in 233 locations. In the United States, 553 million doses were given, and in the United Kingdom, 140 million doses. In Africa, only 587 million people got vaccinated.
Some big companies like Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson and Johnson should share their vaccine recipes and technology with other countries, especially developing ones. This is important because many people need vaccines but do not have them. The President of the United States thinks it's not fair that some countries have many vaccines while others have very few. He wants these companies to help more countries get vaccines.
It is important for all countries to work together to fight COVID-19. Developed countries should help developing countries get vaccines. This is the only way to stop the pandemic.
