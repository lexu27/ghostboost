Throughout history, people did things to keep others safe like using safety rules and quarantines. A person named Mary Mallon in the United States long ago had typhoid fever germs but no symptoms. They called her Typhoid Mary. She got sick, and some died because of her germs. They kept her away on an island for a long time.

Now, with the COVID-19 sickness, people need to take care to stay healthy and not make others sick, just like what happened with Typhoid Mary. Some tennis players got sick during a tournament because of the coronavirus. Even though they tried to be safe, some still got sick. But they did better than with Typhoid Mary because they followed health rules and kept sick people away.

Overall, people have gotten better at keeping everyone healthy since Typhoid Mary. Her story showed that we need to find sick people even if they don't look sick to stop big sicknesses. The tennis player's story showed how acting fast can stop many people from getting sick. We need to ask: "How can we stop sicknesses from spreading?" and "What can doctors do to help?" I think following the rules from the World Health Organization can help control sicknesses.

Also, nurses are important in keeping the world healthy by telling people about sicknesses, talking with others, and finding ways to solve problems. We should learn from the past to make sure everyone stays safe and healthy.
