The movie "For Colored Girls" was seen to find cases of bad things happening. The bad thing we will talk about is called rape. In the movie, a girl named Tangie was hurt by her grandpa (Perry, 2010). Below, we will talk about how to help Tangie better.
First, we need to check how Tangie is feeling by talking with her. We will talk to Tangie and her close people who know about what happened. They will tell us more about the bad things Tangie went through and how she feels now.
After we know more, we will make a plan to help Tangie. We will talk with Tangie often about her feelings and what she thinks about what happened. Also, we will put her in a group with other girls who were hurt like her. This will help Tangie not feel so alone and sad. It can stop her from feeling very bad all the time.
During the plan, we will also teach Tangie how to handle the stress from what happened. We will give her books to read and talk with her about important things. It's very important to have people who will listen to Tangie and help her feel better.
