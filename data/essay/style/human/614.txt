An initial reaction speed is a fast speed at the start of the answer. The picture shows the up and down lines, up means the amount of stuff in a liter, and down means time in seconds. Here, the stuff reaction is going backward in time; at the start of the answer, the stuff amount is very much, so it's a good reaction. As time passes, the hill gets smaller, making a bad line; so, the stuff amount goes down in some time.
A fast speed is a quick speed in time with different speed, the stuff against time. The quick count is by finding how bad the hill and line are for the amount of stuff in a liter against time in seconds (Du et al., 2021 p 3154). Speed is the badness of the hill over time in seconds; this gives the quick speed and the difference between them, which gives the fast speed.
The speed counts the middle over some time by dividing the stuff change in a liter over the time by the time. Finding middle is by looking at the change in the stuff's amount using the math where the line means the attention of the stuff. A minus sign is used when the speed is a good number from the last math. But, the minus sign is not needed to find the stuff that was used middle rates. Finding the middle from B to G is by adding all the amounts and dividing them from B to G to get the normal. To end, at the start of the reaction at point A and time 0, the stuff amount was high, while at point G, the attention was low.
