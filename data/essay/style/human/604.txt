Bandung Meeting was the first time Asian and African countries, free from Western rule, met. President Suharto asked leaders from developing lands to come to Bandung for an event about saying no to big countries and living together peacefully. They wanted to work together to be less dependent on Europe and America. The meeting wanted to help Asian and African countries work together better and say no to new ways of being ruled by others. The main rules of the meeting were to respect each other's land and power, solve problems peacefully, and not interfere in each other's business. This group was made so countries could stay out of the Cold War fight and be strong together. As a result of the Bandung Meeting, many Southeast Asian nations agreed, which helped end the Cold War. African and Asian nations got to speak up in world matters, like the Global South. This event let developing countries choose to be with the USA or USSR. Even though they didn't want members to join the big countries' fight, many Asian and Southeast Asian countries still got involved in the Cold War. In short, the meeting of Asian and African nations, with twenty-nine countries from Africa, Asia, and the Middle East, said no to being ruled, racism, and the growing Cold War between the Soviet Union and the United States. This deal was important in keeping more nations away from the war. Their main goal was to control their own politics and respect each other's power, giving them strength in future politics without the Cold War.
