An aboriginal person is someone who comes from Australia a long time ago. They lived there before new people came. The aboriginal people used to hunt and gather food before they started farming. They came to Australia from Asia a very long time ago. When the new people came from Europe, the aboriginal people had many problems like money, power, and change in their old ways. They lost their language, land, and family. They were made to work for the new people. The old people were treated badly and had to leave their homes. Many of them got sick and died. The aboriginal people spoke many languages, but the new people did not care about their ways. Families had to leave their homes and go to other places in Australia. The children of the aboriginal people should be seen as one group because they have the same blood, traditions, and beliefs as their old family who lived in the land many years ago. They also come from the same places like the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia, East Timor, Singapore, and Indonesia in Asia. They should have the same rights as others to protect their old ways and history.
