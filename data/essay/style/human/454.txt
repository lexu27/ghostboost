In survey about work friends and job feelings, 89% said talking with coworkers make life better (Suhardi, 2020). If someone has one friend at work, they feel more connected to the job and want to stay. Being friends with others helps people be more interested in work. By talking with coworkers, someone becomes less scared to share thoughts and ideas. 

Scientists at Michigan Uni did a cool test called Friends (and Sometimes Enemies) With Cognitive Benefits: What Types of Social Interactions Boost Executive Functioning? People in the test were split into two groups: one group talked for 10 minutes, and the other group argued about a topic. Then everyone had to do some thinking tasks. The people who just talked in a chill way did the best in the tasks. They got better at planning, focusing, and organizing - things we need for work.
