The hero's story in tragedies is linked to the society's changes. It can be a story about many people affected by big problems. It can also be about a small group of characters in conflict. In Shakespeare's sad stories, we see how characters' lives connect to society's path. Shakespeare often writes about good people dying and fighting each other. In "Othello," two main characters kill their wives to protect their honor. They believe that women should obey their husbands to show respect. Iago and Othello think they are right in killing their wives to save honor. Othello kills Desdemona because he was tricked into thinking she was unfaithful. After realizing the truth, he feels guilty and kills himself. Othello thought people were not honest and life was not fair. He believed in being honest and good, so he chose to die. The play teaches us to fight for truth and not lose our minds over honor. Shakespeare shows how strong feelings can change a person, unlike other writers. Othello's character speaks to everyone, whether they are jealous or not. His emotions show the power of human nature.
