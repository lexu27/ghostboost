The number of people without insurance in my state, Washington, is very low. In 2019, it was 6.6%, much lower than in Oklahoma (14.9%) or Texas (18.4%) (Kaiser Family Foundation, n.d.). I believe that having less money makes it harder to get good health care. People with low incomes often don't have insurance or qualify for Medicaid. So, they don't go to the doctor as much as they should. They only see specialists in emergencies and don't take care of other health problems.

I think the reason for the low percentage in my state is because there are many jobs here. People can afford health insurance. They also know a lot about their health options. And there are many hospitals and clinics, more than in rural places. All of these things help more people have insurance.

Talking about the difference in care quality and health access, I should mention things like ethnic differences, education, and community. In my state, people from different backgrounds can fit in and get help easily. But in some parts of the country, certain groups may face discrimination, which makes it hard for them to get a good education and good jobs.
