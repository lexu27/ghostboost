A digital policy helps our organization online. It says how our brand is shown and what we want to do. It also tells how workers can talk online with others and on social media. This makes sure things are good for the company (Brown, 2019). 

Our group has a plan for online that keeps our brand safe. This makes workers more loyal and they share more online, making more money. The company's secrets are also safe. 

I am online like the company. I show what we sell and talk to everyone. This makes good relationships and helps the company look good. 

I use social media to show our brand. I make sure the info is good before I post. I post about our success a few times a week. 

I talk about our prices and why our stuff is good. I talk about our wins but not any bad comments from others. 

After my class, I will handle bad comments better. I will also market better by aiming at the right people and changing how I talk.
