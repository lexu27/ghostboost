The big sickness from COVID-19 made many jobs disappear. More people don't have jobs now than before the whole world closed down (The Economist, para. 2). This happened because companies either closed or had to fire some workers to not go broke during the money crisis. The Economist talks a lot about how many people don't have jobs now and how long it will take for things to get better (para. 1-3). It's a hard problem, so McConnell et al. talk about the main reasons for it in chapters 12, 15, and 18. Chapter 12 talks about what the government did about the job situation during the crisis (McConnell et al.). Chapter 15 is all about looking for jobs, which is important because many couldn't find work due to the bad money situation (McConnell et al.). The last chapter talks about jobs and not having jobs and how it affects all the jobs together. 
The smart money person, Gary Becker, got a big prize for helping with money stuff by using human behavior ideas in money, crime, and people studies. He looked at why people do things to get more money, be famous, or be known, to see how it links to money decisions and crime (The Nobel Prize, para. 2). Becker's best work is about how this idea connects to treating people from different jobs unfairly in the job world.
