In his book "The Entitlement Theory," the thinker Robert Nozick thinks about a really fair money system in the perfect state. Nozick looks at the problem of things you own, how they move from one person to another, and how they get accepted, giving a plan for claiming fair rights (Vaughn, 2019). True fairness, as Nozick says, is about getting things or getting them first, moving them nicely and with agreement, and keeping the right to things you own.

By the idea of getting things fairly, people can get things if they don't take them from others or make others worse off. By the idea of moving things fairly, people have the right to give things away or switch them willingly. Nozick dreams about a world where free swapping will make money unimportant - in this world, what people need will be most important in trading things. By the idea of accepting things, if someone wrongly takes something, they must give it back. Nozick thinks only the first owners have the right to things, following the first two ideas. The writer sees a fair moving of things only when they were first gotten fairly and all the steps after are fair too.

The writer calls this idea of fair giving out "historical," where it's through how things were gotten that we can say if it's fair that someone has them. Using John Locke's idea that people own themselves, Nozick says people have talents that are theirs. By mixing these talents with the world around them, they can start to own part of this world by agreeing, that is, get things.
