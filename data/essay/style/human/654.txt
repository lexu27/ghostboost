In this chapter, Joseph Campbell talks about the importance of lady characters in hero stories. He says that "The Lady of the House of Sleep is a familiar person in fairytales and stories" (Campbell, 2004, p. 101). This means that without this character, the story would not be complete and men would not have a reason to follow their goals in adventures without ladies. The main goal is important to face difficulties along the way, and the prize at the end should be worth the challenges. So, the main idea confirms that this feature in hero stories is very important.

To prove this idea, the writer uses a quote from famous stories. He looks at where this idea comes from, like the old Irish stories, for example, "the tale of the Prince of the Lonesome Isle and the Lady of Tubber Tintye" (Campbell, 2004, p. 101). This method helps him find the common things in all similar stories and support his ideas with good proof. These things include the challenges at the start of a journey, the hard times along the way, and the final success, with meeting a beautiful lady.

Based on the quote and its meaning, it shows that all fairy tales and stories from different cultures are alike. This means that lady characters in these stories are strong, and their role is as important as male heroes. Since princes and fighters in all these stories are ready to fight monsters and face many problems to find them, this idea seems right. Also, the fact that the ladies are sleeping makes them look inactive, relying on their heroes to save them.

The main reason why this quote is important is that it has all the important details in one sentence. It only talks about ladies as important characters who are sleeping and waiting for male heroes to save them. Also, the writer mentions that these characters are familiar to readers, which helps in understanding the stories. In the end, this quote clearly shows which genres have this feature.

In conclusion, the part of the text from Joseph Campbell is a good piece of writing that talks about the important role of female characters in stories. By mentioning famous stories, the writer explains that this idea has been around for a long time and is still seen in modern works. Choosing this quote was important as it had all the key details about the topic. So, this review of the book shows that this idea is common in different stories in this genre.
