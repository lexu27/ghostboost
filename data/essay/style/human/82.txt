One of the important parts of the test is to check risks and make goals. These help to know where to go and plan better. The video shows how they check risks and set goals when talking to someone.
The test starts by checking risks, with the counselor asking if the person thinks about hurting themselves. Then, they ask to tell if they start feeling that way. They do the same for thoughts of hurting others. Lastly, they ask about drug problems like seeing things that are not real. 
Goals are set by asking what the person wants in life, like a good job or a better future for their kids. They also need a more specific goal like stopping drugs. Other goals for counseling can be to be less angry, sleep better, eat less, and stop drugs. They also check how confident the person is in achieving these goals. The last part is questions for the counselor and the structure of the session.
To sum up, risk assessment looks at risks like self-harm, harm to others, and drug issues. On the other hand, goal setting focuses on general aims, specific goals, and goals for counseling.
