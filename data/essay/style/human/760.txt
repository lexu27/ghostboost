Modern world has many different cultures and people. In the past, people lived in separate groups that were similar to each other. They didn't like strangers much. But now, the world is connected, and people live together from many different backgrounds. This makes it interesting to see how they influence each other (Nelson et al., 2018). This paper looks at how white and black young people develop their ethnic identity.
A study by del Toro and Wang (2020) looked at how 961 African American teenagers were taught about their culture at school and how it affected their grades. They found that students who learned more about their culture did better in school. The study also talks about how teachers can help students of color do well in school by making sure white and black students get along.
Some studies show that parents usually influence how their kids see themselves, but not always. One study found that parents teaching about their ethnicity affected how kids saw themselves, while peers teaching about bias affected how kids saw themselves too. This study shows how important parents and friends are in teaching culture (Hughes et al., 2017). It shows that talking about culture can help white and black teenagers be better people.
