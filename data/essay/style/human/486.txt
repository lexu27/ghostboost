Unfortunately, I not go to any event or concert with dance culture. But, I remember TV show about New Zealand people and their special culture. The show was in New Zealand and they do Poi dance. I watch it in December 2021. It was not my first time seeing dance, but I like this one a lot.

Poi dance is by many Maori men and women who do dance together. They do easy moves like step and move arms and hands. Also, women spin and walk in line. They use balls, bars, and sticks in dance. They sing too. They show Maori culture, happiness, and thanks in dance.

A big part of the dance is using objects like balls, bars, and sticks. Women start with balls, then use white bars, and then sticks. They make music by clapping and singing. They show story with the objects. For example, they step and move arms with balls, and sit with bars. Bars and sticks make sound when they hit the floor.

Dance is important for Maori culture. It shows their people and how they work together. I like how many people dance and sing together. It makes me happy and respectful of their tradition.

Maori wear special clothes and makeup for dance. They sing and show with faces. They do songs, dances, and use objects in dance. They also do war dance with shouting and clapping. They have dinner with fish and fruits after the event.

When I see this dance, I feel amazed and part of something. I want to dance and sing like Maori. I never feel this way with dance before. Their energy is amazing. I like how they all dance together and show Maori culture. This dance is special and makes me happy.
