The TED Talks are like stories about how people grow and how they feel when they are not part of a group. For example, Smith (2015) talks about how it is different to raise a white child and a black child. Abdel-Magied (2014) tells us how clothes can change how people see Muslim women. Discrimination starts with having opinions, and this can affect how people see others. An article in New York Times (2016) talks about how non-white people in the US feel left out. This feeling is because of having opinions that favor one group over another. These opinions can be quick, unclear, and mixed depending on what people think about different groups (Fiske, 2022). I have not faced such things myself, but I know people who feel bad about themselves because of discrimination. I want to learn more about how people see others because of their race and how this affects society today.
