The world is broken because Russia attacked Ukraine. Ukraine's army is fighting back, but the war is getting worse. Europe might see a big invasion. Many people left their homes, and Ukrainians ran to other countries for safety. Guns and bombs are hitting houses in Ukraine. News outlets are telling everyone what's happening.

Newspapers talk about the news in different ways. The New York Times and a French newspaper called Le Monde write about Ukraine. They both talk about the same things but use different words. When Russian soldiers took over Kharkiv, the New York Times said, "Russian Troops Take Over Kharkiv," while Le Monde said, "La Russie A Envahi Kharkiv," which means "Russia Has Invaded Kharkiv." There's a video of Ukrainians making bombs. The New York Times said, "Ukraine Prepare Molotov Cocktail In Kyiv," and Le Monde said, "Ukrainian Resistance Using Molotov Bombs." Headlines are important because they make people want to read the news. The New York Times makes it sound like a big war, but Le Monde makes Russia's actions seem less bad. The newspapers use different headlines to get people's attention.
