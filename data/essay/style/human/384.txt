Korean Popular Culture and the Selling of Place is about K-pop music and Korean dramas helping South Korea show off its cities and countryside. The book talks about how South Korea uses things like K-pop, K-drama, K-food, plastic surgery, and tourism to make different plans. It also talks about how city planning and Hallyu are important together. The book uses an academic view to show how Korean cities use TV and music to make themselves look good and bring in tourists. It does this by writing things down, looking at history, and using pictures to help tell the story of Korean culture.

Pop City talks about how pop culture sells places in two ways: making Korea known worldwide and making Korean culture stronger in politics. In the 1990s, local elections made cities want to make their countryside better. For example, Wando County, a small village, spent $8 million to make a K-drama based on its history. This brought in 50 million tourists and $160 million in 2008. Other places do the same to get foreign tourists and money. Local leaders also play a part by controlling the city's money and promoting drama sponsorships without asking the people.

Pop City also looks at how K-pop is popular worldwide. K-pop shows use cool images that make people like them. They also have idols who appear in shows, movies, and music. These idols are like products that make people buy K-pop stuff. The book says that when a new idol group is made, a lot of effort goes into making them look special. This way, they can make a lot of money in the competitive market.

Lastly, the book looks at how human feelings help sell Korea's cities and K-pop. It says that when people like K-pop and K-drama, it's because they feel connected to them emotionally. Tourists visit K-pop and K-drama sites to feel emotions like desire, love, and excitement. This creates a special bond between people and places.

In the end, Korean Popular Culture and the Selling of Place shows how K-food, K-pop, K-drama, fashion, tourism, and plastic surgery help promote Korean culture worldwide. It explains how Korean cities use politics and global fame to make their places sell well. This book is a good read for anyone interested in Korean culture, city planning, and the sociology of Hallyu.
