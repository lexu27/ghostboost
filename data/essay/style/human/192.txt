Introduction
Descartes’ ideas are called dualistic. This means that they talk about how material things and ideas are equal but can exist separately. Descartes discusses how the mind and body are different. He says the mind cannot be explained by mechanics. Descartes explains how the mind and body can be connected, even though they are different.

The Problem and Solution
Descartes tries to solve the problem of how the mind and body are connected. He says that thoughts about oneself are clear and true. Descartes believes that God helps humans understand things clearly. He thinks that the mind can think and want things freely. On the other hand, the body is different; it moves but doesn't think.

Cogito
Descartes’ first thought is that the mind is a thinking thing. This idea is clear for him. He believes that God is the only true thing that exists by itself. Descartes explains that some things are in our minds from the beginning, like the idea of God and numbers. He says that the mind and body are very different and have different functions.

Criticism and Response
Some people disagree with Descartes. For example, Thomas Hobbes says that only material things can think, not spiritual things. Descartes explains that thinking is a spiritual substance. He argues that the mind and body are different, and freedom comes from the mind. Gilbert Ryle also challenges Descartes, saying that thinking and acting are connected. Descartes believes that only by divine intervention can the mind and body interact.

Conclusion
Descartes’ ideas about the mind and body have been criticized, but they offer explanations that can be understood through thinking. He uses the idea of God to explain why people act in certain ways. Descartes' theory of dualism has been recognized for its clear explanations of thinking and human development.
