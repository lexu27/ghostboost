The stories of how Rome began show important things for a strong country in old times – making quick decisions, being ready for war, and being able to change in politics and society. Different types of history people have tried to understand the tale of Romulus and Remus since it started. The next parts of Rome's supposed past also make many questions about fighting between brothers, kidnapping, hurting, and the first people in Rome. It's interesting that most stories say Rome started with brothers fighting since the city's history is known for fights and wars. Some historians tried to make this story sound better – Cicero didn't talk about it, Dionysius of Halicarnassus said Romulus felt bad, and Egnatius said Remus didn't die and lived longer than Romulus (Beard, 2015). Another Roman history person – Livy – wrote about Romulus getting angry at his brother's actions, showing the city's founder as tough and fair (Beard, 2015). No matter how people see it, it seems like being ready to fight, making quick decisions, and solving problems with force were important in Roman stories and history.

But Rome's history is also about being open, including everyone, and letting people move up in society. Even though many of the first Romans were said to be bad, this made Rome's politics and society more open. Unlike other old countries, Rome not only let in foreigners but made them part of the society, slowly giving them citizenship (Beard, 2015). A king from Macedon in the 3rd century BCE saw the good things about how Rome did things (Beard, 2015). It's quite clear that Roman stories of how it began are tied to what Rome is, and we can see why Rome did well by looking at its stories.
