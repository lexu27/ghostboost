The story of Yusufiyah talks about a very sad happening that occurred in 2006. Some American Soldiers did very bad things at an Iraqi family's house. They hurt the daughter and killed everyone in the family. One soldier named Pvt. Justin P. Watt found out about this and told others to make them face consequences for their actions. Pvt. Watt was very upset by what happened and felt bad because he knew about it even though he wasn't there. This made him feel very sad and confused.

A morally injurious experience is when something happens that goes against what a person believes is right. Pvt. Watt had this experience when he learned about the massacre. He wasn't there when it happened, but he heard about it from his friends. He was also on duty during that time and heard things on the radio. He felt guilty for not stopping it and felt like he was there even though he wasn't. This made him very upset and affected his mind.

This event made Pvt. Watt feel very conflicted. He was torn between his loyalty to his friends and what he knew was right. He felt shocked that his friends could do such bad things. He felt sorry for the innocent people who lost their lives. Pvt. Watt questioned if he was a good soldier and if he did the right thing. He felt bad for the families who lost their loved ones. This event made him feel like he did something very wrong.

To help Pvt. Watt, he needs to talk to others who understand what he went through. He also needs to talk to someone he trusts about his feelings. This will help him feel better and know he did the right thing.
