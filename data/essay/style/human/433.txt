From long time ago, people used signs and stories to tell about things that are not just in the world we see, but also to share with the next times. Today, big names use stories to make their things popular because they are very special. The mark of Versace is very fancy and unusual; it was made in 1978 by Gianni Versace. The mark looks like the head of Medusa Gorgon from old Greek stories. The designer said he chose this character because it is both pretty and simple, like the clothes they make. Another example is Lamborghini; before, the Italian company made tractors. The bull became their sign, as the bull is important to Zeus. Some people think bulls are very tough and strong, so this makes the brand seem powerful. Now, Lamborghini cars are super fast and expensive, and the sign of the golden bull fits them well.
I like the story of Prometheus because bad things never win, and good things and fairness do. Prometheus, a strong titan, took fire from the gods to give it to people. He taught them many things like writing, counting, and making things from metal. Before, people were scared of the sea, but Prometheus showed them how to make ships; they also learned about medicine. Zeus, the powerful god, punished Prometheus for making people doubt the gods. Prometheus was tied to a rock, burned by the sun, and soaked by rain. But that was not the end of his suffering; a big bird came every day to eat his liver. Heracles, the strongest man, killed the bird, broke Prometheusâ€™ chains, and freed him.
