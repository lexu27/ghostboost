The subject of the project is about how nurses learning evidence-based practice (EBP) can make patients happier with health care. The project wants to do five things to help both nurses and patients at the hospital:

  * The first goal is to see how nurses knowing about EBP affects the care they give to patients. When nurses use EBP at work, they feel good about their work, so it's likely they will do better at their job (Rodr√≠guez-Nogueira et al., 2021). This project will help doctors understand this connection better.
  * The second goal is to help all nurses in general hospitals learn more about EBP. Even if the project doesn't show a link between patient happiness and EBP training, it's still important for hospitals. EBP is a big goal for many hospitals.
  * The third goal is to see how EBP training affects how happy nurses are with their job. Being happy and motivated at work is important for nurses to do their job well. This project wants to see if getting better at their job makes nurses feel better and do better.
  * The fourth goal is to make a quick and good training program about EBP for nurses in general hospitals. Nurses often don't have time for research at work. By offering a three-day program that takes about six hours, the project can show how to train nurses well even in a busy hospital.
  * The last goal is to get a lot of feedback on how patients feel about the care nurses give. Good health care is key in hospitals, so asking patients about their experience can show what nurses are doing well and where they can do better. Even if the project's idea is wrong, the hospital will get useful data for improving services.

All these goals are about making sure patients get good care. Everyone should get good health care, no matter who they are and what they believe in. Some nurses get tired and unhappy at work, which can affect how they treat patients (Sultana et al., 2020). When nurses are tired and lack knowledge, patients might not get to take part in decisions about their treatment. Nurses need to listen to patients and consider their feelings, not just medical issues. By improving EBP knowledge and reducing burnout, this project will help nurses treat patients better. This project aims to find ways to reduce personal worries that might affect how patients are treated fairly and respectfully.
