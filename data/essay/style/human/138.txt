Developing a paper so everyone knows what to do is very important for a group. Charles Schwab, a group that does banking and helps with buying, made a paper for people to sign so they both do what they need to do (Reder et al., 2021). Because this paper has all the important parts of a legal agreement, it is good. 

Starting with the important meanings of the main ideas in the paper, Schwab’s paper talks about the offer, saying yes, and being legal right from the beginning very clearly. Being very clear helps the group and the people using the group, making trust and working together happen fast (Templin, 2017). Also, Schwab makes sure the money part of the agreement is good. The paper explains the legal things about giving out money and trading issues (“Schwab account agreement,” 2022). Saying that Schwab doesn’t have to watch the trading, the paper shows clearly what each person needs to do.

Using the main parts of a legal paper, the agreement made by Schwab gives its users a chance to know well about the help they will get and what they need to do. Also, the paper talks about what Schwab needs to do, making a good way to work together and give the end result to the user. Overall, the way Schwab makes papers can be seen as a good example of how a paper should be made because it looks at the main points and shows clearly what each person needs to do.
