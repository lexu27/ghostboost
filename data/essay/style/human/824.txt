Circumstances and Encountered Issues

In the study shown, we see a lot of pressure on the bosses of Asian Health Services (AHS). AHS is a good group that helped many patients in 2014 and had many places and buildings. But then, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) happened, and things changed a lot for AHS. ACA brought more patients but also made it hard for AHS to help new patients who didn't have insurance. They had to make care better and follow new rules for payment. AHS fixed these problems by using computers, helping patients more, and giving new services.

Still, there are more problems to fix. AHS needs to take better care of its workers. The customer service team needs people who speak many languages for good talks. Also, the main doctor thinks that the doctors and others need more rewards. They also think that the clinics should get bigger since there are more patients. AHS needs to make big choices to get better and fix new problems.
