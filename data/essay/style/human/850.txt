Business Plan
Finding a parking spot is hard for people in big cities. It takes time and fuel, and costs a lot. People spend 20 hours a year looking for parking spots. This is a big problem that needs fixing fast. Overpaying for parking spots makes about $20 billion. Not enough spots and high costs lead to more accidents. Governments can't fix this by just making more spots.
Business Goals
The main goal is to make parking better with blockchain. Blockchain can help a lot with parking. It can connect sensors at lots with the app for parking. With help from the Internet of Things, developers can give drivers the best routes to parking spots. Blockchain keeps data safe during the journey. Hong Kong doesn't use blockchain much, so it's good to start using it for parking.
Another goal is to make payments safe and make money from parking. Digital wallets are important, so we need to accept crypto payments. Smart contracts can help reserve spots and check drivers. The plan is to expand automotive solutions with blockchain. It's not just an app for parking, it's a place for drivers and parking providers to meet in real-time. Blockchain is important because technology is growing fast.
