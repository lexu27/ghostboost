Dyslexia affects kids who see well and think smart in different ways, like not being able to read or get words. Teaching or special school help can make most kids with Dyslexia do better in school. The text says, Learning problems are one result of Dyslexia. A kid with Dyslexia will find it hard to keep up with classmates in many classes because reading is so important in many areas. If Dyslexia isn’t treated, it might cause low self-worth, behavior problems like worry or anger, and not feeling close to friends, teachers, and parents. If Dyslexia isn’t found and fixed in childhood, it can lead to long-term issues as a grown-up. Kids have less chance to do well in life if they can’t learn to read and understand. The author says that Attention-Deficit / Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) can make it harder to cure Dyslexia by making it tough to focus, being hyper, and acting without thinking. Kids with Dyslexia might have more trouble learning if their siblings and parents have the same issue.
Also, boys are more likely than girls to have Dyslexia; but it affects people of all ages, money levels, and backgrounds. Kids born with Dyslexia have a tough time with reading, knowing, and spelling. The text helps me know more about Dyslexic kids; they are good at understanding others and have real personalities. Having trouble with writing and reading might help kids understand others who are struggling. The text’s good points are that it talks about what causes and happens with Dyslexia for the right age group, which is from 4 to 10. But it’s not so good that it talks about boys more than girls without saying why. Also, there isn’t much info on how Dyslexia affects black kids. It mostly talks about how it affects white kids. I will use this text for my final project by making a plan to teach the public about Dyslexia to stop them from thinking it’s a bad thing.
