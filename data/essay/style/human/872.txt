The new passage in the style of a foreign exchange student with limited English language skills:

The new technologys have changed many areas like health and others. This made new technologys that help sick people. One of these is the Automatic IV Pump. It helps patients in many ways. It is used in hospitals and homes to care for patients. But, with more sick people in hospitals, we need better technologys to help patients more. To make the Automatic IV Pump better, we need to give instructions, fix problems, and make some changes. One big change is to teach doctors and nurses how to use it better. This will help them take care of patients better.

Even though people use Automatic IV Pumps a lot, they can have problems that hurt patients. Problems like computer errors, mistakes by people, broken parts, and other issues are common. One big problem is with the screen that can get worse over time. For example, if we clean the screen too much, it might break, and we can't use the pump anymore. Also, people with long nails might damage the buttons on the pump.

But, even with these problems, using Automatic IV Pumps has many good things for patients. They are safe to give fluids. These pumps are made to give the right amount of fluid at the right speed. This helps doctors and nurses to not make mistakes in giving fluids. So, hospitals should use these pumps to help patients more.
