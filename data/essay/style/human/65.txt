Archetypes tell about special things that all people can understand. They are patterns that show up in stories and in real life too. These types of people have common traits and are influenced by what they do and where they are. For example, there is a powerful person like Elon Musk who changes the world. He is seen as a hero or creator by many people. His actions show his special traits and his main goal is to change the world.
These archetypes help me see people and events better. By knowing their traits, I can guess why they do things and what role they play. It's not always easy because people can be a mix of different things. But in general, archetypes help me see why people do what they do. This helps me build better relationships with them later on.
