Artificial brain (AI) is becoming more and more liked in places that deal with lots of information in a short time. Marketing is one of those; being good at it means always knowing what people like to buy and how they act, which needs lots of looking at data. AI helps do this automatically, making businesses work better, maybe up to 40% better (Ramyalg, 2022, para. 3). This change helps save time and money and do better for customers because more effort can go into it. Another good thing about AI is that it makes fewer mistakes by not getting tired or unfocused (“AI could reduce,” 2018). It checks everything and is faster than people, making it much better.

Some think AI might take over marketing jobs because of this. Also, people can be biased and make bad choices, so AI might be more trusted (“AI could reduce,” 2018). But AI can't do marketing alone. People are needed to come up with ideas and make decisions, like planning marketing campaigns. AI is good for doing the same tasks over and over, not for thinking creatively or making decisions (“Will digital marketers be out,” 2021, para. 1). Only people can do that.

People also have to tell AI what to do. If the people who program it have biases, AI will too, which makes it less helpful. Trust is important in marketing, and people are better at building it since they can understand feelings and make connections, which AI can't do (“Will digital marketers be out,” 2021, para. 1). People will always be needed in marketing, and using AI might even make new jobs because someone has to program it and watch how it's working (ibid). So, AI won't replace marketing jobs in the future.
