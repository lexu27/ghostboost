In social place, people talk with others and things around them. They use words when talking with other people. Language is very important in every society because it helps people talk to each other, especially for talking. People in their culture need a language for talking with each other. Some groups use one word for names, while others let people have many words. A name is important because it shows different social roles and relationships among people. People can get more names in different ways and patterns over time. Every country has its own language as a way to be different from others, so everyone in the world talks their own language. Kiesling says naming can be a way to talk, discuss, or show a position. Nowadays, there are many languages used by some people in their daily talks, and slang is one type of language. This paper wants to study and talk about the slang word ‘bro.’

How Information Was Collected
I collected information using surveys, watching people, and looking at media. In watching people, I watched how the word ‘bro’ was used in 24 hours, where it was used, and who was talked to using the word. In the surveys, I asked five other people who use the word ‘bro’ some questions based on Kiesling’s Dude article. In the media, I looked at how the word ‘bro’ was used in three different media forms.

What Was Found
Watching People
When I talked about going to the shopping center at my friend’s house with her and her sister, I said ‘bro’ about three times. At home, I said ‘bro’ two times when talking to my brother about driving me to school. I did not use ‘bro’ with my mom and dad. I said ‘bro’ three times while texting and talking on the phone with a friend about bread and joking. When my brother played video games at home, I heard him say ‘bro.’ My two brothers used the word ‘bro’ in a talk at home when the elder brother was telling the younger brother to finish the dishes. I said ‘bro’ four times while talking about the work I had to do for my other classes. I used ‘bro’ once when talking about our research with a friend in my senior seminar class. I also said ‘bro’ to myself once while getting ready for a presentation for a research project, but I did not say ‘bro’ while in the mosque.

Surveys
The first survey was with a 52-year-old White Arab woman who is a doctor. She never says the word ‘bro’ and does not talk to anyone using this word. She thinks teenagers say ‘bro’ a lot. The second survey was with a 22-year-old Egyptian Arab woman who is a student. She said she uses the word ‘bro’ many times each day. According to her, she would talk to a close friend and sibling, male or female, using the word. She would not use it with a romantic partner, a stranger, someone she knows a little, a boss, or a professor. She could also say ‘bro’ to her parents. She usually says this word when she is annoyed or trying to talk in a funny way. When she is annoyed, she might say ‘bro’ to soften her tone, and when she is being funny, she talks to her close friends using the word. She thinks funny people or people who use slang to talk to each other say ‘bro’ a lot.

Another survey was with a 25-year-old Arab man who is a doctor. He said he says ‘bro’ many times each day and would talk to a close male friend, a male he knows a little, and a male sibling using the word. He would not use it with a female stranger, his parents, his boss, or a professor. He uses ‘bro’ a little when talking to a male he doesn’t know and a female sibling. He says ‘bro’ because it is a word everyone knows and can help identify people. He thinks young adults and teenagers say ‘bro’ a lot. The next survey was with a 22-year-old Asian woman who is a student. She uses the word ‘bro’ about once a week. She would talk to a close friend, romantic partner, and a male sibling using the word. According to her, anyone who is relaxed, easygoing, and friendly might say ‘bro’ a lot.

The last survey was with a 24-year-old Egyptian woman who works as a research assistant. She uses ‘bro’ many times each day. She would talk to close friends, siblings, and parents, male or female, using ‘bro’ and uses this word because it is easy to talk to close people. She thinks ‘bro’ is casual, and instead of saying the person’s name, she might say ‘bro.’ She thinks ‘bro’ is a word used in different situations. She believes someone under 40 and familiar with English slang says ‘bro’ a lot.

Media Forms
I watched a YouTube video and read two articles for this study. In a YouTube video, US President Barack Obama said that ‘Bro’ means an important partner when talking about UK Prime Minister David Cameron (The New York Times, 2015). The US President called the UK Prime Minister ‘bro,’ his close friend, and colleague. In an article by Rolling Stone, Snoop Dogg, a famous rapper, used ‘bro’ when apologizing to Eminem. “I Was Wrong, Bro. “We love each other,” “We’re brothers, man” (Hiatt, 2021). In an article in The Globe and Mail, the word ‘bro’ became popular because of the character ‘Barney Stinson’ in ‘How I Met Your Mother,’ and people have tried to understand him (Mcginn, 2015). ‘Bro’ means a male friend or a male sibling. This article explains how society has dealt with the word ‘bro’ and different types of ‘bros’ like sports ‘bros,’ money ‘bros,’ and fraternity ‘bros’ exist now, changing what a ‘bro’ is.

Looking at the Data
From the data, people use ‘bro’ in certain situations. People mostly use it at school with classmates and at home with siblings and friends. People use this word to start a relaxed and friendly talk. They mostly use this word when talking to people around the same age, mostly below 30 years old. From watching people, ‘bro’ was mostly used with friends who were the same age and real brothers. In the surveys, ‘bro’ was used when talking to close friends and siblings. Three women and one man used ‘bro’ to talk to males but not females according to the surveys. Some people used ‘bro’ a little when talking to male strangers, people they knew a little, and parents. The 52-year-old woman never used ‘bro,’ and she thought it was mostly used by teenagers. Using slang words to talk to elders or people who are not close might not be nice, so every slang word has its own users and listeners.

In the media, people use slang words when talking to men, and society is learning to accept these words. ‘Bro’ is mostly used by men talking to close male friends. The US President and Snoop Dogg used ‘bro’ to talk to their
