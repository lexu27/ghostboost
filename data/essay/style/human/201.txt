The thesis idea and how it’s planned is told in this part. This piece tries to give sufficient information for other scientists who are doing studies about making the management accounting sector digital. The scholar starts by explaining the plan of the research, which includes giving details about the actual steps of the study. The paper then looks into the methods, discoveries, suggestions, and also mentions the limits and what more research could be done.

Research Plan
The plan for the research is a big picture to address the study's issues. A well-organized plan makes sure the research methods fit the research goals, collect good data, and analyze it properly to answer the research questions using reliable sources. Good plans help researchers make good conclusions. The plan links the research challenge to doable studies. The researcher will use an experimental plan, which asks open questions to get a new view of the subject being looked at. The plan was picked because it was the best to answer these questions:
1. “How will digitalization change the management accounting job?”
2. “What skills will a management accountant need in the future with digitalization?”
An experimental plan is a good way to get a new view or clarify your thoughts on a subject. It helps understand why and how things happen. The researcher uses exploratory research to make ideas clear, set priorities, and make new definitions. The scholar says this field of research is new. Few scientists have looked at these topics. There is research on how digitization affects accounting businesses. But there isn’t much about how accountants feel about how digitalization will affect their jobs. The researcher wants to know how digitalization has changed the management accounting sector. Using this study helps the writer gather new info about the subject. It helps take an open approach to gathering and looking at data.

Info Gathering
Researchers can use both main and other sources to get data. The scholar used main data in the thesis to get material for the study’s challenge. Personal talks were important in getting info from the participants. A talk is a good way to get info and make sure the writer gets more info about the person’s thoughts, wishes, and views on digitalization. The researcher got other info from the accounting businesses’ websites to see how digitalization affected management accounting.

Different Businesses and People
Talks with five accounting firms were the base of the research. The people interviewed were different in their experience, age, and gender. They had worked from 9 months to 25 years. All firms chose who would be asked questions. Talking to the manager let the writer see the whole company’s picture. By talking to a management accountant, the writer got first-hand info and a view of how digitization affected their job and skills to reach company goals. A random picking plan gave each person equal chances to be picked.

Talk Method
As said before, the researcher got data by talking, which was a good way to get info about how digitalization affects things. A talk is a way to get more info about a person’s experience, thoughts, and views on a subject. Talks gave good and consistent data relevant to the research questions. Talks were semi-organized, organized, and not organized. The writer used semi-organized talks to keep the talk in one direction and let the person talk freely and explain things better.

Getting Ready for Talks
A talk guide gave a good plan for the talks. A talk guide listed topics and questions the writer wanted the person to answer. The writer didn’t have to follow the guide exactly, but used it to remember important topics and questions. The talk started with a quick look at the issue and themselves, then asked a series of simple questions. These steps helped the person start talking, like asking about their job and how long they’ve worked in accounting. Questions like “What problems and good things do you see with the digitalization of the accounting business?” and “What skills are needed to use digitalization well?” were asked. These were open questions, so the answers would give more info about the subject.

End of Talks
Good talks can be in person, over the phone, online, or by email. The writer chose in-person talks because they make a good connection and are clear. This way, the writer can focus on the issue and control it. The writer used a voice recorder during the talk, which all participants agreed to, to have a good record of what was said. Voice recorders helped the writer be present during the talk to make sure they talked well.

Data Study
The writer used topic study, which is putting, breaking, putting back, studying, and closing. The writer used codes to show the topics from the data gathering in topic study. The writer used topic study for the thesis because it was a good way to get deep talk data and see more new things during the study. This helped the research, which let the writer see main topics, study key topics, and see new problems that came up during the data gathering and looking at it that the writer didn’t see before.

Results: Digitalization of Management Accounting Job
Digitalization changes the management accounting job a lot. For example, IT tools, like doing things automatically, give more resources because there’s less need for doing the same tasks, letting management accountants help with big decisions. New ways of doing business, a change in what management accountants focus on, and real-time data and responses help make new value-added work. Overall, businesses can get ahead by managing the data and info made available through digitalization. Because of many laws, it’s hard to use all these good things. Doing any big change in a business needs a good plan and way to do it. Making a way to make business work well needs open talk and good feedback. People making changes need to have workers join in. A way of trying new things must be set up, and habits need to change. When things are not as stable and there is more uncertainty, big changes can make things hard.

Digitalization is a big help in letting workers try new things, which is important in dealing with changes in the environment. But it’s hard because it goes against another goal that puts safety first by avoiding mistakes. So, using digitalization in the management accounting job is important to keep workers up to date on new tech, like AI and big business systems, to avoid problems and make sure work gets done fast. Before using any new tech, it’s important to know which actions and jobs are right, then say how good they are. One problem is that setting up good IT systems costs a lot. But good data handling is needed to get the most out of any tech. One big issue is that management accountants need to learn new skills to use digitalization well.

AI
Learning skills, like what’s called machine learning in AI, is a big need. Actually, the name “artificial intelligence” was made in 1956, but it just got talked about a lot because of a few things. Big Data is one of them because when AI has to make new choices, it looks at a lot of good data. The second big thing in digitalization is AI. It shows how new the tech is in the management accounting job. Many smart people say AI is going to be a big part of business in the future. In the future, AI could help give good advice to management accountants, or systems could make choices on their own and make
