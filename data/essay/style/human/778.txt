Application
Rules
The log talks about a day of a woman with family, job, hobbies, and school goals, which lead to work dreams. So, I try to use my time well for all these things, which means being active in different areas at once. This also makes social rules very important in my life since I meet more and more people.
During a walk, rules mean being clean and polite so others feel good. Helping friends is a rule too; if you don't, people think you're bad, no matter why. When shopping, the rule is to wait in line without pushing; online, no hate speech or lies are okay. Even at home, rules like being clean and having fresh breath are important, so we brush our teeth.
Macro and Micro Levels
Rules affect both people's lives and the whole society, as society is made of individuals. A rule exists if people do something, thinking others do it or wanting praise from important people (UNICEF, 2021). So, at a big level, rules make most people act the same way in some places. This makes unwritten but known rules that become part of the culture. On a small level, each person has to follow these rules to be seen as normal.
Concepts
Since the log's day is busy, many concepts apply. Socialization is big for people and society, especially with rules. Ward et al. (2019) say talking helps pass on community rules and lets people see themselves. So, people learn how others see them and change if needed.
Family is important in the log, with nuclear and big family. The first is key as we need to match our daily life with our partner's life. The big family connects the small family to society, which helps teach rules. Families have their own ways, but those shouldn't be more important than outside rules. If they are, people might not accept you.
Interactions and showing yourself are key too, linked because what others think of us matters. Sociologists say people make images to show their good sides and hide bad ones (Grebelsky‐Lichtman et al., 2020). So, I check my clothes and don't tell my big family everything to look better.
Looking Back
From my day, I see I talk to many people and play many roles. In my small family, I'm a wife, but in the big family, I'm a child, grandchild, cousin, and more. So, how I act changes with each group, as I feel different with them. My husband sees me as an adult, so I learn to be responsible. But my parents and other relatives still see me as a kid, which can hurt my confidence.
Outside family, I play different roles based on the place, but no one sees me as special, unlike my family. I'm just one of many walkers or customers; even online, I'm like others. So, I act differently; my goal is to finish tasks, unlike with family where I enjoy talking with them.
Even if things are different, both show how others affect me and I affect them. This makes me want to look good, so I dress well outside and hide problems from family. But my needs and ideas matter too, so others might think about them when they talk to me.
