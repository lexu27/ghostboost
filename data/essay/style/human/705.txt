The health determiners are the things in the place where people stay, learn, work, play, pray, and grow old. I think the place where people stay can change their health. Health results are not only from body things or getting good health care. Things that make life better can really change a group's health. Like good and cheap homes, getting education, safety in public places, having good food, local help in emergencies, and being in a place without harmful things. I also agree with the new idea that it's not just the person's choice to make them healthy, but that things outside can really change it. In the new world, a lot doesn't depend on the person. At first, they can pick what to eat, if they want to move, or when they need to see a doctor. Actually, most of the choices about health are from ads, the government, and what's happening in life. For example, ads tell people what to buy, even if it's not good for health. Needing to work a lot to get money for these things makes people give up on sleep and moving. This line has many parts, but the end is always the same: people's health is not really their choice. Things outside also change health in a different way, like health unfairness. When I read about these unfair things from CDC (2022), I was most shocked by the differences between races and groups. In a time of the world getting closer and more open, racism needs to go away. In health care, treating everyone the same is very important sometimes. That's why I think racism in this area needs to go away first.
