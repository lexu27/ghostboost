Knee accidents are very usual, mainly in sports medicine. They can be severe for the patient, making it hard to move and do daily things. There are four connections between the thigh and shin bones: MCL, LCL, PCL, and ACL. The ACL is in the middle of the knee and holds the shin bone in place behind the thigh bone. When the knee is stretched too much, hit from the side, or stops suddenly, the ACL can get hurt. ACL injuries often need surgery to fix them. The torn edges need a new piece put in to heal. The new piece can be taken from the patientâ€™s body or a donor's body. The most common choice is a piece from the patellar tendon. There can be problems during the surgery, but they are not common. Long-term problems like knee pain can happen after the surgery. Some studies look at ways to reduce these problems.
