Technology can help teachers work together better. Tools like audiobooks, special mice, and speech-to-text can help students with disabilities understand their work. For students with bad eyes or trouble seeing, audiobooks or written lectures can be better than taking notes. This can also help keep records organized for them. To work together well, teachers need to know about each student. They can give different tasks and divide students into groups to help them learn. 
To work together, teachers need to be careful with sharing students’ information. They should only share what’s needed to help the students and not for themselves. Teachers can keep some information private by organizing it into important and not important parts. This way, only useful information is shared.
In the future, I want to try Station teaching. Teachers set up stations to teach and help students. This way, students can get help easily, ask questions, and get different explanations. This helps teachers make a good plan, find good resources, and teach each student the best way for them. For students with eye problems, teachers can find ways to motivate and help them better.
