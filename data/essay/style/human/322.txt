The book tells about the main things done by the group and why they do it. It has info on bank robberies in 1978 and other violent stuff that made the Sri Lankan Civil War happen. Also, it talks about LTTE wanting their own Tamil state because the government was mean to them. The book is good for studying what the group wants and how they made their own state. It helps me with my study of how LTTE started.

Another book talks about Tamil people wanting their own state. They show how the minority groups in Sri Lanka said they deserve their own place and shared their ideas with other countries. This book helps understand the group's ideas and how they affect the world. I used it to explain Tamil nationalism in my work.

A paper looks at the leader of LTTE, Velupillai Prabhakaran. It talks about his role in making the group and how they connect to other bad groups. Knowing the leader's plans and how they affect others is good for studying LTTE well. I checked this paper to see why the group failed to make their own state.

In another paper, they talk about how LTTE did bad things, like taking kids and doing bad stuff. This shows why it's important to stop violence in conflict areas. By learning about the group's scary actions, I could talk about their impact.

A study looks at how LTTE got money and weapons to fight the country and why they lost. It also looks at why LTTE ended and what made it happen. This helps to see how the group worked and why they failed. It helped me understand the issue from the group's side.

A case study looks at if LTTE are terrorists or fighters for freedom. It shows the struggles of LTTE. It talks about different viewpoints on LTTE's fighting.
