Tiredness is a common and serious problem connected to many illnesses like heart problems. However, it hasn't been studied much in people with stable heart disease. So, Eckhardt and others decided to look at how tiredness affects these patients. They wanted to know how tired these patients were and if things like age or feelings affected their tiredness. They also wanted to see if tiredness was linked to how good their life was.
The study had five authors: Ann L. Eckhardt, Holli A. DeVon, Mariann R. Piano, Catherine J. Ryan, and Julie J. Zerwic. They are all experts with PhD and RN titles. Ann L. Eckhardt works at Illinois Wesleyan University, and the others are from the University of Illinois in Chicago.
The researchers described tiredness as feeling very tired all the time with no energy. They compared tiredness to pain because it has many parts and can be caused by physical and emotional things. Tiredness in heart disease patients can make them weak and do less.
The study used a mix of numbers and stories to learn about tiredness. They used a special computer program to help with the numbers. They found that tiredness was linked to things like age and feelings. They also looked at who might feel more tired.
102 patients with stable heart disease took part in the study. They were chosen from two clinics. The researchers checked their records to make sure they could join. The patients couldn't have certain heart problems or other illnesses to take part. The study was approved by special boards, and the patients agreed to take part.
The study looked at many things like age, health, and feelings to see how they affected tiredness. They found that feeling sad was the main reason for being tired. This study was not done in a lab, and no changes were made during it.
This study helps nurses know more about tiredness in heart disease patients. The researchers shared all the important details in their study. They worked on this for many months, gathering and studying information. If I could ask them one question, it would be about what they think should be done based on their findings.
To sum up, Eckhardt and others studied tiredness in people with stable heart disease. They asked 102 patients to join, used a mix of numbers and stories, and found that feeling sad was the main reason for being tired. This study is important, and more research should be done to help these patients have a better life.
