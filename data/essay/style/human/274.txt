The things in the lesson talk about the future of diseases and how they change to face new problems in a new time. A smart person named Brilliant (2006) says we can stop diseases, like infections, if we find them early and act quickly. New stuff like big data can help scientists know more about viruses and diseases and help more people (Khoury & Wei, 2015). So, getting data better and understanding why infections happen will help us find them quicker. Also, things like social media can help scientists watch out for big disease problems all over the world and how they start (Center for Infectious Disease Dynamics, 2016). In the future, we might use new things to deal with diseases and viruses on a big scale. This can help us find them and act quickly, but we can't stop them all.

So, I don't think in the future, even if we get better at diseases, we can stop all of them. But, I think scientists will learn more and use tech to bring down how many people get sick and die. Aylward (2014) says that if we get too comfortable now, that's the biggest problem for diseases. If all diseases go away, we won't be ready for new problems, which will be very bad. So, I think in the future, we might stop big disease problems all around the world, but small ones will still happen.
