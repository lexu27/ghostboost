An amazing story about India talks about its great person, Mahatma Gandhi. Gandhi, also known as Bapu, was India’s first leader after helping the country become free using peaceful actions. Instead of armies, Indians used fasting to make Britons go away, which was very special. Learning about ethics always includes talking about Gandhi. Bapu is almost as respected as Aristotle for being good and needing society to be stable. Being connected to Gandhi makes Indians very happy. Many people and groups in the country aim to raise the first leader’s good standards, with some doing well. However, Gandhi’s ideas on the country’s society, money, and politics are not very good. So, this talk looks at the leader’s beliefs on what’s good, different religions, and long-lasting effects. Discussing the leader’s ideas on these topics helps see what Bapu truly believed versus how people see it now.
