Theodore Roosevelt was a young president in America. He had many new ideas and wanted to change things in society. He wanted to help people who felt unsure and unhappy. He didn’t decide quickly to have these new ideas, he thought it was good to protect how people really rule (Roosevelt, 1912). To be someone with new ideas, a person should want fairness, do good things for everyone, and make the world better for people to grow and learn. Having new ideas means feeling positive about new plans and helping to solve problems. People shouldn’t hide or stay quiet, they should act and care a lot about making changes and improvements.

Even though some people like to support new ideas, there are also people who don’t like changes. Roosevelt (1912) said they are people with small minds and not much kindness. People who don’t like new ideas aren’t affected when others make mistakes (Roosevelt, 1912). People who only think about themselves can’t listen to their conscience. All they do is help the powerful and use rules that only help leaders, not the public. They do things like treat workers badly and support capitalism that stops society from growing and creating new things.

Roosevelt wanted people to believe in his ideas and goals. So, he said progressivism was about supporting the real rules and freedoms of society. It was time to make things fairer and equal by explaining how important power and growth are. By following his ideas, people could achieve a lot, like choosing leaders through fair voting. By focusing on politics, helping society, and making important decisions, supporters of new ideas could be successful, along with Roosevelt as their leader. When people think about their choices, they can create rules and laws to make their lives better in different ways.
