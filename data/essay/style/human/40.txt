American slavery started because people wanted to use other people to work for them. This happened a long time ago. People who were slaves didn't own themselves, which was unfair and bad. Even when they were told they were free, they still needed help to live because they didn't have money or support. It was hard for them to be like everyone else without important papers, money, and help from others. People were not treated the same and were left out because of how they looked or where they came from. 

Slavery ended because there was a big war between some parts of America. They made a new rule in 1865 that said slavery was wrong and against the law. This is seen as a very bad time in America's history. People wonder if those who were slaves should have been given something to say sorry for what happened to them. 

Even if slavery is not allowed now and people are free, it is still hard to live without the things they need. How society treats them also affects how well they can fit in. People who were slaves before have more problems than others in becoming a part of society because they had fewer chances. This means they are still not really free as they need help to live.
