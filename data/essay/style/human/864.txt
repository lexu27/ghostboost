Care ethics theory was much talked about because of the idea of slave morality. Nietzsche had this idea and said that when people are treated badly, they might think that being a servant is good behavior. This makes them think that being caring is not good but actually makes the bad treatment stronger.

Another problem with care ethics is that often the help given is only to people close by. The people who help often choose to help only their family, friends, and people from their own country. People who criticize this say that those who help are selective and only help the rich people nearby.

Understanding care ethics is helped by looking at how reason and emotions are different. Held said that a good moral theory should think about women's experiences as much as men's. Care ethics should include feelings in moral rules, not just logic like Kantian Imperative and Utilitarianism.

Also, care ethics talk about how people should behave in public and private places. Held said that ideas about men and women have made people think about public and private life in the wrong way. We should act the same way in both places and not think that certain behaviors are only for men or women.
