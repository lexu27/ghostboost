Emily Dickinson wrote a poem in 1865 called A narrow Fellow in the Grass about fear and lies. The poem shows a man in the Grass who is very skinny. The man makes the readers think about being scared of things they do not know. When someone is scared of what they do not know, they can be tricked. The snake in the poem is like a trickster because it can be sneaky. The snake comes and goes without warning. The author uses these changes in nature to make us feel fear and worry. The poem talks about being afraid and not knowing who to trust, like how a snake can be dangerous without us knowing.

The author talks about the snake like it is a person, giving it human-like qualities. When the snake is called a fellow, it means it can think and plan things (line 1). The feeling of danger is like a common story. It tells us that the author thinks there is a bigger problem than just being scared of snakes. The snake represents fear and lies, which many people can understand. The snake is like the ones in old stories, like in the Garden of Eden, where snakes are sneaky or trick people.

The speaker remembers a time from their childhood when they met a snake. They were tricked into touching the snake (line 12). The snake is good at hiding who it really is, which scares people into believing its lies. For example, the author remembers a time in their childhood when they thought the snake was a Whip Lash. They tried to touch it, but the snake changed and disappeared (line 13). The fear comes from not knowing what the snake will do next.

The poem talks about how the snake can be both friendly and dangerous, familiar and strange. The speaker's reaction to the snake is normal in the natural world. Humans are like animals, and the poem talks about how life and death are real. In the first part of the poem, the speaker treats the snake like a person. It shows a connection between humans and animals. The encounter between the speaker and the snake shows how vulnerable the speaker was when they were a child. Being barefoot made the speaker defenseless in nature. The poem suggests that people and nature are connected and can be dangerous if not respected.

The last part of the poem shows the snake as a hidden threat in a peaceful place. The poet talks about sharing kindness with animals. The language used compares the snake's danger with the harmony in the Garden of Eden. There is a friendly relationship with the snake, but also a dangerous one because the snake has power over the author. The poem suggests that humans can be separate from animals, but they are still at risk from nature.
