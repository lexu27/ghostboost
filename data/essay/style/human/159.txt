In many thinkings, some main examples can be talked about as the perfect self when living one’s living way. In Confucianism, there is a man called junzi - a good person or a gentleman - which many people want to be (Yu-kit 223). The mix of the best qualities that an ideal human should have is a very hard target, but many people respect this. This essay will talk about the Confucian gentleman and look at this idea with Plato’s idea of a wise king.
This thought from the old Chinese culture still is important for the group. This person is better than bad thoughts, and tries to stop them as much as they can (Yu-kit 225). Also, the good person in Confucianism helps others to do this by sharing knowledge (Yu-kit 223). Yu-kit says that a good person, according to Confucius, should be both a good example and a teacher (224). Good behavior is natural for this person, and they show it every day. The Confucian gentleman is the one who lives with high moral rules and wants to help others reach this goal.
Plato’s wise king is similar to this main job. They both show good moral qualities and face bad ones with clear thinking. He is very humble and always wants to know more for the good of the group (Mark). Plato’s idea is more about teaching than being a good model for others.
In the end, both have some qualities of being a good person with moral values, like being nice, fair, caring for others, and wanting peace. But Plato’s best person is a calm leader who thinks wisdom is most important, while the Confucian gentleman puts moral values first. They both want to help others be better by being kind and caring.
