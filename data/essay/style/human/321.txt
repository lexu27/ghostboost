The chapter talks about how trade between countries made their cultures richer and different. Many rich leaders and sellers started showing how strong they were by getting special art pieces. Ideas and books moved around, and people from different places shared a lot. People started accepting others who were different and knew more about how many types of people existed. Connections between different cultures got stronger because of more and more global connections. European ideas went really far, and the ways of people from the West started to be seen as the best and true (Adelman et al., 2021, p. 597). The main word in that time was Enlightenment, showing a time when people started to trust their own minds. People thought they could understand nature and how people act. The chapter is important because it looks at that time from many angles and sees what each place added.
In the book, it talks about how the big countries in West and South Asia became friends. The writer tells how the leaders in the Ottoman, Safavid, and Mughal families helped their countries grow culturally. China, Japan, the Americas, Africa, and Australia growing are also talked about. It talks a lot about how different cultures mixing helped everyone grow. The 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries saw a big global cultural rebirth because of more money (Adelman et al., 2021, p. 595). More books were read, and many new buildings were made (Adelman et al., 2021, p. 595). The world got very connected because of trade between countries. But not all places wanted to change and only agreed a little bit. Islamic and Chinese areas mostly stayed the same, but America and Oceania couldnâ€™t stop European culture from coming in.
