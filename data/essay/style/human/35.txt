Allergic rhinitis is a sickness that makes your nose feel blocked and itchy, and makes you sneeze a lot. A person who is 35 years old went to the doctor because of a stuffed nose, puffy eyes, red eyes, and nose inflammation. These things showed that she has allergic rhinitis. Doctors say that the first type of reaction that causes this sickness is hypersensitivity.

When the body meets something it doesn't like, it makes special soldiers called antibodies. These soldiers sit on cells and wait for the next time the bad thing comes. When the bad thing comes back, the soldiers wake up and make things that cause the body to react. This makes the body have allergies.

The sick person sneezes a lot, worries about getting sick, and feels better when not at home. Doctors say that the puffy eyes and shiny eyes are because of swollen veins under the eyes. This means the allergies give the eyes inflammation. Also, a runny nose and a fold in the nose show that the nose is always runny. All these signs happening all the time mean that something is always making the body sick.

To find out what makes the body sick, the doctor takes a sample from the nose. After that, the doctor gives medicine to help with the stuffed nose and other problems. The doctor also says it's important to keep the environment clean and wash the nose with water. And it's best to stay away from things that make the body sick, like cats.

If the medicine doesn't work, the doctor can give stronger medicine or do surgery. They can use drugs that don't make you sleepy and can help for a long time. But using drugs that shrink the blood vessels in the nose too much is not good. And wearing masks that make it hard to breathe is also not good.
