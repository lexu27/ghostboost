Introduction
Cooking is important. It makes the food tasty and easy to eat. People long ago didn't cook food, they ate it raw. But then, by accident, a piece of meat fell into the fire and got cooked. The person who ate it liked it a lot. This started the cooking process. Cooking helps with digesting food and makes it look, smell, and taste better. It also helps food last longer.
To cook well, one must know about food and tools and be good at planning and organizing. Old ways of cooking are better and healthier than new ways like using microwaves. There are many ways to cook food, some from long ago. For example, boiling and steaming. Microwaving is new.
Different ways of cooking use different amounts of heat and water and take different times to cook. Some foods are better cooked in certain ways. It's important to choose the right method for the food you are cooking.
