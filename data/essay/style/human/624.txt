History and Influence of Using Women and Minority in Police Work

Police work is about following rules and maintaining public order. In the past, mostly white men did police jobs. But now, more women and different minority groups are told to consider policing jobs to lessen problems like bureaucracy and biases. The first women and African Americans started as police officers in the 1800s. In the 1900s, the Civil Rights Act helped with fairness in public places. Having different races in the police is thought to make people trust them more and improve police relations with minorities. Women in police work also help by reducing conflict and misunderstandings in communities. Even though men are more common in police work, changes and respect are important today.
