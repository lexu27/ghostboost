The reason America and Spain fought was because America helped Cuba against Spain. America went to Cuba when the boat "Maine" sank mysteriously in Havana in 1898. They accused Spain of damaging the boat. This made relations between America and Spain worse before the war. America wanted Cuba for money and power, and they already took other places in the Americas before. America said they fought for Cuba's rights and used this to start the war.
America fought Spain for ten weeks and won. They got control of Cuba in 1898. They stayed on the island and got permission for naval bases. America said they were fair, but really they controlled Cuba in a kinder way. They used the bad things Spain did to Cubans to get support. This made it okay for America to be in Cuba.
