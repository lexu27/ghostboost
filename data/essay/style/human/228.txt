The things about hitting at home and being mean to family are called domestic violence and abuse. It can be hitting, yelling, or making someone feel bad. Many people have this problem. A lot of Americans, like 10 million, are hurt every year by violence and abuse. People who are hurt feel sad and small, and they don't feel good about themselves. Sometimes, the person who hurts them makes them scared to tell anyone. But there are signs that can show if someone is being hurt at home. For example, if a lady comes to the hospital with bruises and says she fell, she might be getting hit by her partner. People who are hurt might also feel very sad and worried, even if they try to hide it. If a kid is too skinny and scared of other adults, that might mean they are being hurt. Kids can also get very scared easily. When old people have bruises, are sad, and don't take medicine like they should, they might be getting hurt. If a caregiver won't leave an old person alone with a nurse, that could be a problem. Sometimes it's because they worry, but if they won't listen to the nurse, that's not good. Nurses who see signs of abuse must tell the right people. If a kid is being hurt, they tell social workers. If an old person is being hurt, they tell adult protection people. And if it's domestic violence, they tell the police. But before telling anyone, they talk to a doctor and check the patient without the person hurting them around.
