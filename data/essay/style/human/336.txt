Neil Foley speak about Mexican Americans in USA history in the book Mexicans in the Making of America. The writer talk about these events in the first part, "The Start of Mexican America," where he show how Mexican Americans come and the quiet fight between two countries. The writer's main idea is that American government make a picture of lazy Mexican people who cross the border to do bad things like kill and sell drugs; this make Mexican Americans also feel bad (Foley 34). But the true was that white people from south states were illegal in Texas in 1830s because they no follow the country's laws (Imery-Garcia 12). Unfairness against Mexican people was start in the 1846-1848 fight and agreement, that take Texas and Mexican people to be part of USA but not give them their rights.  
It was interesting to learn from this part what many people in USA think about Mexico as a place of mean and not smart people. It show that they forget the Aztec Empire, when Mexico stop slavery before USA, and when Texas join USA. The 1846-1848 fight between USA and Mexico was rude, bad action of USA to a weaker neighbor, who have money trouble at that time (Foley 24). The new law after the fight let people go back to Mexico or be USA people with same rights that not really happen (Guti√©rrez 5). So, many want to be seen as Spanish Americans not Mexican to not feel bad. I agree with the writer that this history make a border between neighbors and make them not understand each other later on.  
In short, the first part of Foley's Mexicans in the Making of America talk about how Mexican Americans start. It talk about the war between Mexico and USA for Texas and how this change the relation between these countries. In all, taking Texas make things bad between them, make people see Mexican workers bad, and make Mexican Americans hide where they come from.
