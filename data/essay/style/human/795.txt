Ageism is a big problem where people are treated badly because of how old they are. It makes people think bad things about each other and can make them feel sad. The media often shows older people in a bad way. This paper talks about two bad examples of ageism and one good example of how older people are shown in the media.

Stereotypes in ads about older people make others feel bad because they don't show real life. For instance, there is an ad called "This Is Getting Old" by E-Trade that shows older people doing jobs they don't like because they didn't save enough money for when they stop working (Advertising TV, 2018). This ad is ageist because it makes people have bad thoughts about older workers, those who are struggling with money, and older people in general. Another example is an ad named "Dear Young People, Donâ€™t Vote," where older people tell young ones not to vote (NAIL Communications, 2018). This ad is ageist because it shows older people as selfish and not caring, which is not true. A good example is an ad by DocMorris, where an older man exercises to lift his granddaughter to help her put a star on the Christmas tree (Sport for Business, 2020). This ad is nice and shows that older people can do good things too.

In summary, ageism is bad for how people see older folks. Bad examples in the media make older people look less important. They also make people think aging is not good, even though it is natural. But there are also good examples that don't show ageism. They help people have a better and more supportive view of older folks.
