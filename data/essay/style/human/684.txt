The picture will be in one newspaper page. It will talk about ocean trash to everyone. People care about oceans and know about sea trash and bad things for fish and nature. But not many know about deep-sea digging and bad things for homes and people in oceans and near the beaches. The talk will make people worry about oil companies near water and bad things for people and fish. The idea of the talk is to stop deep-sea digging. I will use a picture and some words to explain clearly without making people confused or asking questions. I want to show the bad things caused by ocean digging, the threats to homes, and life. People feel different about ocean digging, and the newspaper talk should help everyone know more.

The main idea is the bad things from deep-sea digging. The main idea should make people think about humans and nature together. Deep-sea digging has big risks of oil spills that are bad for sea animals and make climate change worse. Using this way a lot can make sea levels rise, animals disappear, and hurt nature and humans. The main idea will show what can happen in the future from a lot of deep-sea digging. The picture will show the idea in one picture and some words. The picture will be nice, clear, and make people interested, with the words.

Using good sizes, colors, and layout will make people look at it quickly. The words should be neat and not messy. Using simple words will help everyone read it better. The words should be big to show the main idea. The colors in the picture should be nice and show the idea well. The colors will have meaning and show what the picture is about. The words will say the main idea clearly. The first letters in each word will be big to make it important.

The picture will show a beach with digging machines and big barrels leaking oil into water and animals covered in oil. The water will be dirty with oil, and people will be dirty too. The picture will make people feel sad and scared. The picture will show how bad oil spills from digging are for people and animals. The animals covered in oil will make people feel bad for them. The people covered in oil will show how bad digging can be for people. By showing big risks, leaders should think about nature more than money from oil. The picture should make everyone stop using oil and use better energy.
