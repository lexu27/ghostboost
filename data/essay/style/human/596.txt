Test reliability is very important for good test quality. It helps to show how well the test can measure the thing we are studying. We check reliability after we look at the test questions and put them together in a final test. We do a special check to see if the test is reliable. A test can be reliable in two ways. First, a test is reliable if it stays the same even if we change things when we give the test. Second, a test is reliable if it is all the same inside and the way we check the answers is right. Test reliability is also connected to a kind of mistake called random error.

Tests, like everything people do, can have mistakes. There are three kinds of mistakes in tests: small mistakes, big mistakes, and random mistakes. Random mistakes happen when we get different answers even if the thing we measure doesn't change. We think that all the changes are because we don't measure right. Sometimes it is hard to tell if a mistake is random or big. Every test has mistakes from both kinds but in different amounts. How much of each mistake type there is depends on how good the test is and the test conditions.

Tests always have mistakes, even if we are very careful. But we can use math to see how big the mistakes are and to see if the test is good. If we don't use math to check how reliable the test is, we can't trust the results. So, test reliability helps us know if the differences between people taking the test are because of them or just random mistakes.
