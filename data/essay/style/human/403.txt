Levels of culture can be seen in different parts and deepness. Edgar Shein and Edward Granter talk about culture levels in organizations. They say there are four levels: top, symbols, talk, and thinking. This paper looks at the levels of culture at Macomb Community College.
At Macomb Community College, things like the logo show they like focus, attention, and duty. The buildings look modern with metal and glass, so maybe they like tech and science. But there is also an old building and a park with trees, making it feel quiet, good for arts and social studies. The college is big on helping each other and being polite, like with the bus that helps students.
Signs at the college show they like things neat and tidy. Teachers here maybe like when students are calm and serious. The college might not want students who are too loud or into pop culture. The website is simple, not flashy, not like selling cookies or going on trips.
So, they checked the culture levels at Macomb Community College. They know what the college stands for with its things and values. But they could be more open and less strict about identities. Being open is key for good relationships in a friendly college community.
