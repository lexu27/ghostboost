The writer is JK McKnight. He made Art of Impact to talk to Gen Z and millennials in a good way, and he made the Forecastle Festival for music, art, and nature. The text came out on December 3, 2021, on Lane Report, a place for business news (McKnight, 2021). The paper wants to talk to bosses who want young workers. McKnight wrote it when people didnâ€™t like their jobs. Also, the virus made people tired and not happy with work (McKnight, 2021). This made many workers, mainly young people, look for jobs that they like.

It is important to say that the text wants to tell bosses what makes young people work for them. McKnight also gives some good tips for hiring. The main idea of the writer is that work is different now, and bosses need to follow new trends to keep workers (McKnight, 2021). The text does a good job of telling bosses what they need to do to make sure workers are happy with their jobs.
