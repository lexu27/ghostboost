Based on the Texas Board of nursing, bad things happen to an RN who drinks and drives. The board in Texas thinks not all problems with nurses are the same. They think nurses who were sick before but got better can help patients again in some cases. The Registered Nurse should expect something called Tex. Occ. Code 301.4521. The board looks at everything about the situation. Sometimes they need drug tests, nice letters, and papers from bosses. Joining a group to help nurses might be a way to fix things. If the nurse messes up again, they may get in trouble and have limits. If the RN does what the board says, it will be okay. But sometimes the decision can change.
A nurse from New York moved to Texas and wants a Texas license. She said she did a bad thing with money before but will finish being watched soon. The board will check this like any other case. If it's a big problem, the board may not let her work with some patients.
