Goals and things we want to achieve and are often used in the same way. But they are different in how they work, when they happen, and how specific they are. Nickels et al. (2019) say goals are big and long-term things that organizations want, while objectives are the specific and short-term plans to reach the goal. For example, the law system uses goals to tell the police, correctional agencies, and the court what to do, like stopping crime, helping people change, punishing bad behavior, fixing things, and keeping bad people away. So, the law system is focused on stopping bad behavior to protect people's rights.

In a time of fast change, many differences, and things being hard to understand, having good leaders and people who can manage things is very important for any group. Also, being able to lead and manage well is very important in the law system. Leaders show the way forward with a plan, while managers make sure things run smoothly to reach the group's goals and objectives (Nickels et al., 2019). Leaders need to take risks and make changes. For example, in the police, leaders need to set high standards for others to follow. Apart from leaders, the law system needs managers to make things run well and achieve good results. Usually, law leaders and managers work together to do things right, considering what's right and what the law says.

Getting a degree in the law field would help me a lot in reaching my long-term goals. I really like making changes as a leader. But I need to use what I learn with my work in the law system to be better at what I do. The law system is getting more complicated and needs more long-lasting changes. So, my other goal is to be better at handling changes. Making big changes with good thinking skills is an important goal by itself. Also, getting good at working with people and helping those from different backgrounds.
