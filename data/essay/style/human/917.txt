The US is good at helping democracy. But some small groups like Chinese and Native Americans had hard times with discrimination. They had to fight for fair treatment next to white Americans. Even with many problems, they stayed to help in World War II. This made the government and society see that working together is important.

Chinese Americans did a lot in WWII by joining the US army. Takaki (2020) said their strong support stopped Japanese lies about Chinese Americans and made China help the US. Even with bad living conditions and white Americans being mean, they used the war to show they love their country.

The Navajo tribe had reasons to not like white Americans. But they agreed to fight together to keep their country safe. They helped with secret codes using their language (Takaki, 2020). A language once not allowed became a big help in winning the war.

It's surprising how much Chinese and Navajo Americans went through, but still fought with white Americans when they needed help. Using the Navajo language in the war was inspiring, turning US diversity into a weapon. We should remember this and help smaller languages and cultures.

It's sad that non-white people have to prove themselves to be accepted by white Americans. Movements like Black Lives Matter show that some groups still face discrimination (Garret, 2018). New immigrants deal with the same intolerance as those before them, having their languages and cultures seen as less valuable, and not getting the same chances for jobs or education.

To finish, Chinese and Navajo Americans did a lot to protect their country in WWII and showed their loyalty. Despite discrimination, they helped and showed the power of working together. Using the Navajo language showed how important diversity is. We should remember these lessons from history.
