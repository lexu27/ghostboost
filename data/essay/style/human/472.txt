Environment-friendly technologies grow as more people understand the problems from using chemicals like pesticides in different industries. Sharma and others (2020) say, “these chemicals go into nature, making it hard for the environment to stay balanced because they build up in living things” (p. 110812). As a result, different ways to protect plants and animals from getting too much of these chemicals are needed (Sharma et al., 2020). Methods like using living things, semi-chemicals, and physical ways to control pests instead of pesticides need more support to make the environment better. Government plans, laws changing, and business ideas that help the environment are important for new things to happen.

There are ways to change how pesticides are used in industries like farming and raising animals. First, people need to know more about how harmful these chemicals can be to humans through health programs or events. Knowing the illnesses that can happen to their families from using pesticides might make them more responsible than just telling them about future problems (Magarey et al., 2019). Second, lawmakers and the government can make programs to help those who want to use fewer pesticides (Sharma et al., 2020). Special taxes, benefits, or rewards can push farmers to try other ways to control pests and not use neonicotinoid insecticides. Lastly, there should be ways to measure how dangerous it is for one industry or company to use pesticides. Magarey and colleagues (2019) say, “being eco-efficient is a good way to manage pests and keep things going for a long time” (p. 3129). Rules and goals that match how things are made can make companies look for better ways to produce things that are good for the environment.
