Chapter I

First chapter talks about women in Neo-Confucian places like China and Japan. Chinese society was strict to women, but both countries didn't treat women well as they were controlled by men. China had laws to protect women, but they limited women's freedom. For example, to prove they were raped, women needed to show evidence. The rules were strict, and widows had to stay in the husbandâ€™s house or remarry. Some Chinese women were painters, like Chen Shu. In Japan, women had more freedom but still had to obey men. They worked early, managed homes, and helped husbands. Rich farmers educated their daughters to serve the wealthy.

Chapter II

Second chapter talks about women in the Ottoman Empire in the 17th century. Men could marry many women, and nobles had harems. One former concubine, Hurrem, became powerful and influenced politics. Harem women, except the sultan's family, were slaves but could socialize and get support. Dynasty marriages were popular, and Turkish princesses married young to increase power. Women outside harems could seek help in court for marriage, property, and other problems. Women could divorce, but had to obey husbands. Men could have many wives, but women could choose their husbands, and forced marriages were rare.
