Chinas Food Culture and Table Etiquette
China is a country that is very polite about food with a long history. In China, it is important to have good manners at the table because guests and locals have specific spots at the table during meals. It is nice that Chinese people take care of older and younger people first during meals. Normally, the main dish, which usually has rice or grains, is put in the middle. Rice is very important in meals because it is special to society. Since China grows a lot of rice, people think it is valuable and important, so they make it the main food in every meal. Older people sit at the front of the table and get served first. Chinese people use both hands to get rice bowls as a sign of respect, no matter how old the person is. So, when you are in China, it is good to enjoy rice and treat it with respect during meals.
Another interesting thing about Chinese food culture is using chopsticks. I think it is cool that Chinese people hold chopsticks differently depending on the meal. I find it hard to eat noodles with chopsticks, but Chinese people make eating rice with chopsticks look easy and nice. It is amazing how they can pick up meat and fish with chopsticks when I don't even know how to hold them right. I learned that chopsticks are special in China and they are believed to bring luck in marriages.
Norms And Values In ‘How Family Works’
The writer talks about family customs and values in a traditional way. In the past, communities used ceremonies and rituals to show their importance socially, culturally, and economically. Passing through different life stages was a normal thing, and people had ceremonies for each stage. Nowadays, families celebrate these stages differently. While people used to have rituals, now they have parties and religious customs for events like birthdays, graduations, and religious ceremonies. Older people passed on traditional knowledge through stories and by following old customs. Families have always been important in keeping traditions, habits, and ceremony places.
Big events like weddings were treated with a lot of respect. In the past, the bride's family received a gift to show the girl's worth and the community's value. During weddings, the couple faced away from their parents to show they were starting their own family. These traditions continue today, where families still follow old customs for generations. Communities also celebrate seasons by sharing and giving thanks. Generosity was a key value, and people exchanged gifts during festivals. People still celebrate seasons with festivals and religious events like Christmas and Thanksgiving.
Comparison With How My Family Works
In my family, we share the same name with our grandfather, and we follow the same traditions. Older people sit at the head of the table during meals and meetings, and they oversee everything. We have special recipes for important events like Turkey and Green Bean Casserole for Thanksgiving and chocolate cake for birthdays under 10 years old. We pass on family traditions through stories and books written by family members. We follow religious beliefs by attending ceremonies and being respectful and honest. We celebrate milestones like birthdays, baptisms, and graduations. People still give a dowry before marriage and weddings.
