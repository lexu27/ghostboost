Black Lives Matter is a big movement that changes how we see race. It wants to stop unfairness in America. This includes when police and courts treat black people badly. Black Lives Matter is in many states in America. The movement started after a young black person was killed. One year later, a court with five white people and one black lady said the police officer was not guilty. This made many black people protest.

Black Lives Matter is not about one person's mistakes but about how the American system treats people unfairly based on skin color and money. The leaders of Black Lives Matter are part of American history. They believe in democracy and equal rights. The COVID-19 situation made things worse for Black Lives Matter. Racial problems got bigger with the virus. More black people got sick compared to others.

Black Lives Matter is about people who don't have the same rights fighting for fairness. Black people have faced unfairness from the government and society. This movement wants to make sure black and white people have equal rights. Black Lives Matter has changed the world a lot. Black people want to meet their needs as members of society.

This movement is known in many countries. People see how bad the racial problems are in America. This makes people think about how to be more accepting of differences. Black Lives Matter helped society grow morally. We need governments to make things more equal, not just protests. People want to have their rights respected. We need to make smart decisions to solve this problem.

Black Lives Matter has made a big impact on society. COVID-19 showed us all the problems like unfairness and inequality. When people feel rejected, they might give more power to certain groups. Racism can be like a defense mechanism. Some people think we can't get rid of racism because humans always want to be better than others. So, we need to keep fighting against inequality in all countries.
