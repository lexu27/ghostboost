I choose these internships because they are for a medical helper. This job is needed in many medical areas. Each program has different focuses on the main jobs of the helper. But all these types of tasks for a medical helper are interesting to me. I want to learn about medical work at a big health place in the first internship. In the second one, I want to be better at checking skills. In the third one, I aim to learn how to find out what is wrong with someone. The fourth one will let me treat patients on my own. The fifth one will show me how to help a doctor closely. I will apply for the first internship to fill in my missing knowledge. The second one will help me get the skills I need for this job. The third one will give me hands-on experience. The fourth one will teach me the right way to help.
