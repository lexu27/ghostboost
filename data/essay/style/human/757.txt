In many recent years, there are more and more programs that give money in poor countries. The writers of When the Money Runs Out talk about how good and not good this is for helping people in the long term (Braid et al.169). The scientists found that giving money helped women to go to school more and have less babies. But when the help went away, good things like less HIV and young marriages also went away (Braid et al. 160). Even if poor people get money without any rules, it helps for a short time with school and being well. 

The research is based on articles that say the help with money can make a big difference in school for a long time. The scientists also see that there are problems with the research, especially about things like skills, jobs, and money, the results are still not clear. The scientists looked at a two-year program that gave money to girls in Malawi (Braid et al. 170). They compared girls who got money with girls who did not get help. After two years, they looked at the data to see what happened after the money stopped (170). The girls had to go get money every month. They also answered questions for the study (Braid et al. 173). One important thing they found was that this help can make girls go back to school. The writers say that giving money can make school better for girls who need help. This study can show why this kind of program is important.
