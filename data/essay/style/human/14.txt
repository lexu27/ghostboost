A change in the genome of an animal or plant is called a mutation. Mutations usually happen when there is a mix-up in the DNA code, making new genes or changing existing ones. In this essay, I want to talk about random mutations. These mutations happen by accident - like if a sheep is born with shorter legs in a group of sheep; such changes can also happen in people. One gene called ADRB1 controls how much sleep a person needs to be okay. Most people need 8 hours of sleep, but around 5% of folks have a different version of this gene. Tests on a mom and daughter with this gene showed they only need 4 to 6 hours of sleep each night. This gene change is a type of mutation that affects how a protein in our bodies works. This type of mutation is common in humans, but we are not sure if it happens in animals too since no studies have been done yet. This mutation is okay for people and does not hurt them. So, it is a helpful change for those who have it. Even though this mutation is strong, it does not spread a lot in the population. I think this case is cool because it shows how our genes can change naturally, giving us new abilities. That's why it's important to study these changes to understand what humans can do better.
