The myth and how it stays in culture for many years is very interesting to smart people. Joseph Campbell's book about the hero with a thousand faces talks about this a lot to show how myths are connected to how people think and feel. In this paper, the first chapter will be talked about a lot.

The main point of this part can be seen in this quote. The writer says that myths can be scary because they challenge the safety we have made for ourselves and our family. But they are also very interesting because they show us things about ourselves we didn't know before (Campbell, 2004, p. 7). This means that people mix myths with dreams to understand themselves better, see how they fit into the world, and deal with changes.

Myths help people go through hard times and put together their thoughts and feelings. Before talking about the quote above, Campbell (2004) talks about how old myths with scary things keep coming in people's dreams today. Things like hate, pride, and wanting what others have mix with love, thankfulness, and other feelings to make people do things. This is tough for people because it shows what's really in their minds, even if it doesn't match what they think or feel when they're awake.

The writer explains this idea more by talking about letters from people who dream about things like myths that show their worries or hidden fights. Campbell (2004) tells a story about a guy dreaming of hurting his dad to get his mom's care, which is a story that comes up a lot in old myths. Also, the writer talks about a woman seeing a half-horse-half-man in her dream even though she never thought about cheating when she was awake. This shows how things from childhood can come back in dreams when people are grown up. This idea helps explain the second part of the quote, which says that by seeing the mixed-up dreams, people can learn about themselves and what makes them feel and act the way they do.
