The fight for freedom in Latin America was super important. People in places that used to belong to Spain and Portugal got their own countries, which was very good for them. The leaders of the fight came from different groups, but mostly from Creole landlords because the other rich people were not so strong. Some Creoles were not happy and they made secret groups to plan things, which is why they led the fight.

In the late 1700s, the rich people in Spain's and Portugal's lands in America got even richer and more focused on other countries to sell things. They were not happy with the rules that stopped them from doing business freely. The poor people, like Indians and mestizos, were treated really badly and they wanted to work on their own lands. The fight for freedom in Spanish America was good for business, which was hard to do because of the rules from the old leaders.

The world situation helped the fight for freedom. Spain was busy fighting with France and England, so the rich people in Spanish America worked harder to be free. They made secret groups to get ready for a fight and to get rid of the old rules. They wanted to stop paying taxes and to trade freely.

The rich Creole business people needed new places to sell their stuff because they were doing so well. They liked the idea of trading freely and they had lots of land to use. They were very into liberal ideas and wanted to be free to do business. They were different from other rich people because they knew what they wanted and were educated.

The fight for freedom in Spanish America helped make things better for business. The old rules were changed, and most countries became republics. In some places, slavery ended, and the church had fewer rights. The native people didn't have to pay some taxes or do forced work anymore. Countries in Latin America could trade with others freely, which was good for business.
