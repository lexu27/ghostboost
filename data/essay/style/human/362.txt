Introduction
Many ideas try to explain how people talk with each other. One thing about relationships is they happen bit by bit in steps. The Six-Stage Plan talks about how relationships go from saying hi to breaking up (DeVito, 2016). The movie He’s Just Not That Into You (2009) looks at six love stories and how they fit into this plan. Each couple goes through different parts of the plan and shows different relationship ideas.

Alex and Gigi: Love Rules Plan
Alex and Gigi meet at a bar. They start by sharing info about each other. Gigi wanted to meet a guy who didn't call her back (Kwapis, 2009). Alex helps her and gives advice about love. Gigi keeps calling Alex for help with dating. This follows the love rules idea that says relationships stick together with rules and fall apart when rules are broken (DeVito, 2016). Gigi thinks Alex likes her, but he doesn't, leading to a fight.

Alex learns he likes Gigi after their fight. He tells her he loves her (Kwapis, 2009). He showed love by being real, spending time, boosting her confidence, and feeling a connection (DeVito, 2016). The last scene shows them as a couple, showing they are in love.

Ben and Janine: Love Fight Plan
Ben and Janine are married, but their love is falling apart. Janine is mad at Ben for not wanting kids and smoking, knowing her dad died from it. Ben is unhappy because he isn't ready for marriage and gets tempted by others. They argue and don't trust each other, leading to a breakup.

Ben cheats on Janine, making their love end. This fits the Love Fight Plan, saying people in love feel mixed emotions and want different things (DeVito, 2016). Ben wants excitement but also stability with Janine. When Janine finds out, she tries to fix things but ends up leaving him.

Ben and Anna: Love Charm Plan
Ben meets Anna at a store, and they hit it off. Ben gives Anna his number even though he's married. They start a secret affair. This shows the Love Charm Plan, saying people get together based on attraction (DeVito, 2016). They like each other's looks and personalities. Their love ends when Anna learns Ben wants to stay with his wife.

Anna and Conor: Love Trade Plan
Anna and Conor's love is fading. Conor wants more than what Anna gives him. This fits the Love Trade Plan, saying people want rewards in love or they get upset (DeVito, 2016). Conor wants more than Anna offers, leading to a breakup.

Beth and Neil: Love Trade Plan
Beth and Neil are married, but Neil won't propose. Beth feels sad and tells Neil she wants to marry him. Neil doesn't believe in marriage but helps Beth when she needs it. They get back together, showing that love is more than just a ring.

Conor and Mary: Love Charm Plan
