Western scholarship has made African culture look strange for a long time. They see it in the wrong way because of the past. African thoughts and ideas have been changed and used like things to be sold. p’Bitek and Marimba talk about African culture, spirit, and thoughts. They say how the Western way has changed them without knowing what they truly mean. The selling of African culture and making it like European ways, mixing up culture with thoughts, and religion with spirit makes it hard for African people to know who they are.

Scholars say African culture is not different from thoughts or the spiritual side of life. European ways are practical and make things to look at, not to be used. p’Bitek says culture changes from "how people live" to "something to buy" ("What is Culture?" 14). So, young Africans, especially in Western places, see their culture as things to keep, not part of their everyday life. They also face Western religions that like being poor and alone (p’Bitek, “Man Born Unfree” 21). Ani says African-Americans feel lost as they are not close to their old African ways but see a gap between them and European ways (49). This makes people lose their connection to their families and history.

The readings tell us that African and European ways are very different, and the European way controls how African ways are seen. So, many people grow far from their culture, forget it, or see it in a wrong way. African culture is about thoughts, spirit, living in the now, and seeing the beauty in life. But now, it is just something tourists look at, and the people are made to see it like strangers, losing their real link to the past and nature.
