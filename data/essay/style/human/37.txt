Amazon is big in US. Many people like it because of fast deliveries and cheap prices. It has many workers and big buildings in the country. Sometimes, there are problems. People talk a lot about how Amazon treats its workers. We need to look closely at the work conditions in Amazon. 
Main Problems: Workers not happy and many leave
Giving $15 per hour is good for people with little money, but not forever. It is better to slowly give more money to motivate workers. When workers think about finding a new job, they work harder. Amazon should think about using old ways to make workers happy and stay longer.
Reason: Workers not motivated enough
Online shopping is very common now, especially during Covid-19. New companies are growing fast. Amazon wants to save money by building in places where the economy is not good. Many workers leave Amazon quickly.
Solution: Use older ways to motivate workers
Amazon's rules make workers scared and not friendly. They need to give more money, bonuses, and change how they watch workers. These things will help Amazon to make workers happy and respected.
