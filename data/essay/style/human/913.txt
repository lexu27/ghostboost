It is not easy to choose the main ideas and make a special order in today's art world, which includes music. Some artists affect young minds, and politicians might use certain tunes during elections. The current situation in art is too unclear to give definite opinions on this matter. Hip-hop artists talk about many big city issues and problems faced by young people: drugs, meanness, violence, and not having clear life rules (Rabinowitch, 2020). The movement for women's rights is important for young people now, and female artists are becoming famous figures in music. One of them is Lady Gaga, who started her career as a unique singer with a strong voice. Singers like her express discrimination and mistreatment in a heartfelt way. Some reviewers see Moby as a key artist who impacted today's cultural scene. He introduced a new music style and made his songs popular, even in the political scene of the U.S.

There is a difficulty in expressing yourself with bold statements in today's culture (cancel culture, hate speech, public shaming). Back then, artists were more daring, but the world and society were different for them. The public sphere is always changing, so artists now need to find new ways to get noticed or talk about different topics (Rabinowitch, 2020). The online world is crowded, especially on the Internet. It's hard to surprise a modern young listener and keep them interested. It seems like this is not just about individual bravery but about big social changes that have happened over many years.
