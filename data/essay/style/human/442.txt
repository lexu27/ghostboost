A new thing in the stores is the electric scooter. It got famous fast because it lets people go quickly from one city place to another. Also, people save time since they do not get stuck in red lights (Hagiu and Wright 1527). But the biggest plus is that it does not hurt nature and needs less power for fixing. These scooters use only a little energy to run, so they are better than cars (Hagiu and Wright 1527). Some electric scooters can get energy from the sun, making them simple and cheap to move fast. So, these good things make people choose electric scooters more, and they become popular soon.

Another thing that will grow in shops is wireless headphones. They are liked because all phone makers make them now. They are small and comfy to use, which is their edge (Hagiu and Wright 1527). Even though they cost more than normal headphones, they last longer and do not break fast. They are getting more known in the shops since they connect to phones without wires, which is handy now. Also, folks who get a phone usually get the headphones from the same brand (Hagiu and Wright 1527). So, these good sides make wireless headphones more and more in the shops and people like them.
