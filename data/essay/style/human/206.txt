There are many kinds of not real news. Some are easy to see like articles that are not true, and some are harder to see. People make big decisions based on what they read in the news, like how to vote or what to do when they are sick. That's why it's important to have news we can trust. When people can't tell what's true and what's not, important problems get mixed up and confused. Some not real news is made to make arguments worse. It's very important to think carefully when you write or read things on social media. Lots of not real news stories are made to make people feel strong emotions like fear or anger. So, it's really important to think and check things before you believe them. 
It's very important to look at a few things when you see wrong information, like finding out if the news is true, knowing if a website is real, and checking before you share or write a comment. First, check where the news comes from. Fake news sites sometimes use names that sound like real news places, but they don't have real stories. If the website looks strange, go to the "About" page and see what it says about the company. Second, look at who wrote the news. Check if they are trustworthy â€“ do they have a good reputation, and do they know a lot about what they write? Also, why they write can be important. Third, checking facts is important because real news will have many facts like numbers, data, and words from experts. If those things are missing, ask why. Sometimes wrong information has wrong dates or times, so it's good to check when the news was written.
