Globalization is big now. People everywhere are connected because of the Internet, even from far away. This makes a big change happen. People from different places and cultures now share a common culture together. But, not all cultures are represented the same. Strong cultures can make weak ones disappear. Some people don't like this and feel very proud of their own culture. This can cause fights between countries. It's important to see globalization as a normal thing in human history. It has good and bad things, but it's real. The world is very connected now. We can know what's happening far away, listen to music from other places, and read books from different countries very quickly. This makes a new culture for everyone. But, extreme nationalism is a big problem that we need to solve together.
