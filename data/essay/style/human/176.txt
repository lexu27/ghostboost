Culture is about how people act and what they believe in a certain group. Some groups are similar, and they make clusters. Leaders are special people who are not the same in all countries. They are also affected by the way people act in their culture. People from different groups have different ideas about time. Some Middle Eastern countries like old things, but Americans like new things and think they can control the future. Barak Obama is an example of a leader who talked about changing things and became famous. 
Leadership is not just about the future. A study by Crede et al. found that leadership changes based on culture. In some places where men and women are not treated equally, leaders who make big changes are more successful. Culture affects how leaders act, so it is important to include this when talking about culture. Culture shows who people are and who has power to make big decisions in society.
