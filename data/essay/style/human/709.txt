The big talk is about the Supreme Court saying no to vaccines and weekly check-ups for businesses due to the coronavirus rule. They said OSHA shouldn't be the boss for companies with 100 workers or more. Instead, the boss should decide how to follow the rule.

Some think COVID is getting worse, and the rule was a good idea from Biden to fight the virus. A report from CNBC using data from Johns Hopkins University showed over 731,000 new infections in seven days, which is 4% more than before. But some said bosses should choose if they want to follow the rule or not.

The main idea is that these rules are too much, and they don't look at all the disease cases. The Supreme Court agrees and thinks this rule is more about public health than just keeping workers safe. They also said COVID is like any other risk we face every day, not just a work problem. Another reason against the rule is that OSHA doesn't have enough experience to try this big thing. So, the court's decision and the talk we had make sense and show more bad things than we see at first.
