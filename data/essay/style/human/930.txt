The crime of asking for too much money needs two things: a bad thing you do and wanting to do the bad thing. The bad thing you do usually means getting things from someone by saying you'll hurt them (Nikolić et al., 2017). You might say you'll hurt their body, their stuff, or say something bad about them. For example, a bad person might tell someone to give them twenty thousand dollars or they'll show private pictures. But, sometimes just saying you'll do something bad is not enough to be the crime of asking for too much money if you don't really want to steal.
Often, the wanting to steal element needed for asking for too much money is wanting to get money or stuff that is not yours. You must have this wanting when you make the threat for it to be asking for too much money. Wanting to do the bad thing and making the threat is enough. This means you don't have to actually steal money or stuff to do the bad thing of asking for too much money. In the example before, if someone asks for money and then threatens to show photos if they don't get it – the wanting to steal element needed for asking for too much money is not there.
One way to say you didn’t do the bad thing of asking for too much money could be to show that the money or stuff taken with the threat is taken fairly, like as payment. So, if a worker doesn't get paid and threatens the boss to get money, it might not be asking for too much money. To protect yourself from these crimes, it could be useful to have programs that teach about cyber risks, protecting personal information, saving digital proof, dealing with cyber threats, and reporting bad things that happen (Vasiu & Vasiu, 2020, p. 24). These plans are important because nowadays, asking for too much money is a big problem online because of lots of digital technologies.
