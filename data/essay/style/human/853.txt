Bobsville town not very safe for people, even though police try hard. Burglaries, fights, breaking things, and car crashes still big problems for safety. Happen many times each year, which a lot for small town with less than 9,500 people. Big problem during town events and sports games, when many tourists come visit. Need plan for when people steal or start fighting, or if car crash happens.
When bad things happen, need to tell people so they can be safe. Put message on website saying what happened and what to do. Maybe box pop up when visit website, say date, time, and what to do. Also put messages on social media before bad things happen. For example, if many thefts or fights expected at sports game, warn people to be careful. If something already happened, use social media to tell people what to do. Can also use TV or radio, but people more likely to use phone. Messages should include rules to stay safe and what to do if something bad happens. For example, if sports fans angry and start causing trouble, tell people to avoid certain places.
Website: "Warning! People causing trouble in Bobsville on January 30. Stay away from downtown and stadium." "Bad car crash on south side, check who got hurt."
Social Media: "Know how to stay safe at event." "Fight happening at festival, leave right away."
TV and Radio: "Sports festival today. Be careful and watch your things." "If trouble or crash, keep emergency numbers handy."
Even though trying to keep town safe, can't fix everything. Gaps in police can lead to problems. Questions like where were police during trouble or why not stop bad things at entrance can come up. Also, what if stuck during fight or crash and can't get out? Need plan for that too. Plus, need to be careful with conflicts in town and tourists drinking too much. Local winery selling lots of alcohol can cause drunk people to act unsafe.
