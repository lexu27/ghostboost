With digital tech, email now very important. Email makes talk easy with friends, family, work people, and others, super fast, no need to talk in person. But it's interesting to see how email has changed talks.

In talking, email made it wider, can talk online, not just face to face. This makes talking easier. Email also changed how we show feelings and body language, as words can't show this well, especially in work emails. We can use emojis and stickers, but not much in emails, more in chats. Email is good because we can talk lots, always be connected. But some problems like needing internet, device, and safety issues.

People make mistakes in emails when they act like talking in real life. Mistakes like not knowing who you talk to, bad manners, mixing writing styles, and writing too much. To avoid mistakes, learn email rules, check messages before sending, use right words for who you talk to, and keep messages short and clear.
