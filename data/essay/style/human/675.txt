"Coronation of Poppea" talks about Poppea, who loves Nero, the fifth Emperor in Rome. Nero says he will make her powerful and his wife, even though he is married to Ottavia and has problems with Seneca (Tommasini 34). Some people may not like the opera because it shows cheating instead of valuing marriage. It tells a story from the past about how a strong man can betray his wife and send her away without getting in trouble.

Arias, recitatives, and choruses are words used in music. An aria is a song for one person to sing, often in an opera. It can be sung alone or with music but is different from regular speaking. Recitatives are like talking with music in operas and can be more like a chat or a nice song. A chorus is a part of a song that repeats and stands out, adding more to the music. It can sound different from the rest of the song and might have more instruments.

In the Baroque time, orchestras used many different instruments to play complex music. They had strings like violins and woodwinds like flutes. They also had continuo instruments like organs that helped make the music rich. Percussion instruments like drums kept the beat, and brass instruments like trumpets were also common.
