Social movements are connected mostly with their leaders, who show the wishes for changes that must happen. To do well, people need charm and good leadership skills to tell their ideas to everyone. This paper compares two leaders, Martin Luther King Jr., who led the black rights movement, and Alicia Garza, the founder of Black Lives Matter.

In Dr. King’s speech, he talks about his idea for the future of black people. He believes everyone should be seen as equals, not just by humans but also by a higher power (Rare Facts, 2017). He dreams of a USA where people of all colors and backgrounds live together as equals, not as oppressed groups. Alicia Garza’s speech talks about what's happening now, not about the future (Center for Constitutional Rights, 2015). She shares facts about how black people, especially women, face discrimination in today’s society dominated by white men, like earning less, dying more, and being put in prisons more. She ends her speech by explaining who BLM is and what they stand for.

When comparing Dr. King and Alicia Garza, we see that King is a better speaker. He is used to talking to bigger crowds and has more experience. His voice is strong and carries weight, with the first part of the speech sounding like an epic tale, and the second part stirring emotions in the listeners (Rare Facts, 2017). Alicia Garza aims to inform the public first. Her speech is full of facts and statistics, and she seems to struggle to remember all the numbers, often needing to check her notes (Center for Constitutional Rights, 2015). Her passion shows in her voice and actions, but overall, she seems like a student giving a presentation. While both speak mainly to black and supportive audiences, King focuses on men, while Garza focuses on women.

Dr. King chose a church at the Lincoln Memorial as the location. It was a meaningful place for many reasons – it felt safe and disciplined because of its religious significance. Also, it tied the message to Lincoln’s fight for freeing slaves and the belief that all men are made equal by God (Greenberg & Page, 2020). Alicia Garza’s location seems more like a TED Talk venue, nothing special. However, she benefits from social media to spread her message, making the location less crucial for gathering people and sharing the message.

Both speeches connect well with their audiences. King’s speech was heard by not only blacks but also whites and Hispanics who shared the same feelings about their struggles. He saw them all as one nation united under God. Alicia Garza’s speech mainly targeted black people (Center for Constitutional Rights, 2015). It educated them on the injustices they face and called for their support in fighting injustice worldwide. In essence, these two speeches had different goals – King’s was a call to unite the nation, while Garza’s was one of many speeches in the ongoing BLM campaign.
