Organizational things are super important in healthcare places. They help make plans work well. Knowing about organizational culture is key for making healthcare better. This study looks at how important culture is for stopping infections, how to change culture, and how leaders play a role.

There isn't one definition that fits all about organizational culture. But one that's good is by Shein. She says it's like the group's shared ideas on how to handle issues inside and outside the group. These ideas are taught to new folks as the right way to think and feel. Different organizations have their own rules and values that make them unique.

Preventing infections in hospitals is a big deal. Following prevention rules helps keep infections low. But it all depends on how the organization is set up and how employees act. How employees act affects how infections are controlled.

There are some theories on changing culture that are important. One theory says culture changes when values are created to deal with new things. Another theory talks about how employees change their behavior. It mentions different ways people learn and act. Lastly, there's a theory that says leaders are super important for changing culture.
