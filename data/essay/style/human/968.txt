An individual's way of solving problems with others is very important for working together. According to the questions I answered, it seems I am okay at handling small arguments between people since I got 15 out of 21 points. This shows that I can manage simple disagreements where people don't agree on everything, but I might need help from a professional when the arguments are more serious. 

I think the questions were quite good at judging how well I can help people in conflicts. Firstly, the results match how I deal with arguments in real situations at work and in my personal life. I find it easy to talk and find solutions that make everyone happy when the problems are not too big, like who does what tasks or when people work differently. But when things get more complicated and need big changes or take a long time to fix, I might not be so good at making everyone agree quickly. The questions in the test were good at figuring out my skills because they looked at my experiences and feelings about conflicts, not just if I had training. Because of this, I think the questions did a good job.

Also, it's helpful to look at my strengths and weaknesses with a SWOT analysis. Some things I'm good at for handling conflicts are my ability to control myself, understand others' feelings, and work with people from different backgrounds. However, I'm not so good at dealing with direct and strong arguments, which could make it hard for me to stand up for myself. Watching experienced people solve problems at work is a good chance for me to get better, but I have to be careful not to copy them without thinking if it will work for me. Looking at my SWOT analysis, I am somewhat ready to face conflicts.
