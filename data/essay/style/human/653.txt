Program History
Head Start is very important for children, families, and towns. It started in 1965 as a big program for kids (Administration for Children & Families, 2021). For many years, it helped many poor kids and families in the United States. It stayed strong because it always tried to be better and meet the needs of the community.
Because of Head Start's good work, other programs like Henry Booth House were made. This program in Chicago helps families with education and healthcare. It started long ago by a group in Chicago. They wanted to help kids, teach those who need it, and make life better.
Henry Booth House has been around for a long time, more than a hundred years (Cause IQ, 2021). They have learned a lot and now offer many services like learning for kids, healthcare, and help for families. They focus on helping kids from before they are born until they are five years old.
Kids who are three to five years old can join Head Start at Henry Booth House. Babies and kids up to three years old can join Early Head Start. Families who are homeless, in foster care, or get help from the government can also join. The program also helps families who don't have a lot of money.
The program in Near South is open five days a week from early morning to late afternoon. It is checked by the city to make sure it is safe and good for kids. The people who work there must have good qualifications to teach kids. There are rules about how much space each child needs to play and learn. Each classroom can have a certain number of kids based on the space.
The team at HBH Head Start is very qualified to help kids and meet the rules. They have different levels of education from teaching to kids. They have three teachers for each group of kids, so they can give each child attention. The program is known for its high-quality care for kids and families.
