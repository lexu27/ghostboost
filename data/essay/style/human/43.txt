The essay looks at a book about how to use a dishwasher made by Bosch. One good thing about this book is that it has many pictures to help understand how to use the dishwasher. For example, the book shows how to put rinse aid, set dishes in the dishwasher, and take out baskets (Bosch, n.d.). This book is made for people who might not know much about using a dishwasher. Also, the part about setting up the machine is not very detailed and just has basic ideas. So, the people who made the book think professionals will set it up. Another reason showing that this book is for people is that most of the text is in lists. This makes it simple for a user to find all the needed info quickly. The book is helpful, clear, and convincing because it talks about exact problems users might have. For instance, it says how to pick the right program for different dishes and leftovers, stop or change the program, and check the machine's condition.
Even if the text does not use difficult words, the book still seems professional. This is because it gives answers to many specific questions. The book has info on how to use the dishwasher, look after it, set it up, throw away garbage, and what to do if something goes wrong. Like mentioned before, the book is focused on design. It has many pictures, plans, and lists that make it simple to read. Also, near the parts with warnings, there is a sign. An exclamation mark in a red triangle gets the reader's attention and makes them focus on that part. The book is also organized well: the first part talks about what's in the dishwasher; the second part tells how to put dishes in it. After that, it explains how to add softener, salt, and rinse aid. Finally, it talks about looking after the device and what to do if there is a problem.
