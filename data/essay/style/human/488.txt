In the past ten years, Chinese internet companies have grown very fast. This is important because, in China, the internet is famous for being blocked by a big wall. But there is another part of this issue that people haven't looked at much: the three big Chinese internet companies are also connected to the global economies in how they get money, who owns them, and who controls them (Jia & Winseck, 2018). China's government wants to make the country's communication network better and has a lot of power, which has made the internet grow quickly in China. But the latest growth of the internet in China is because of three things: the government, internet companies, and foreign money. These things are really changing the Chinese internet, but not many people have studied them enough. The word "financialization" talks about how important finance, financial markets, and investment companies are in the economy. Financialization affects the big economic conditions and changes how financial markets work, how companies act, and economic policies. Also, financialization makes the financial sector make more money than other parts of the economy. When there are financial crises, it can cause a lot of lost money, hurt poor people, and make more people jobless.
