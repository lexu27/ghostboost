Kantian ethics is a clear example of non-consequential ideas in philosophy and law. Many people who support this idea also like utilitarianism. In Kant's philosophy, he talks about non-consequential ethics a lot with his idea called the categorical imperative. This idea is about how people should behave morally. The imperative tells people how to make moral choices in a rational way. Kant thinks that moral principles should be specific and not change based on the situation. He believes in universal and absolute morality, not based on personal interests. According to him, true morality is not flexible or based on the situation. This creates a conflict between universal moral laws and individual actions. People might not always follow universal morality and might make their own rules. In this case, the categorical imperative might just be an idea and not something people follow.
