Data science is the study of digital data from start to use in different fields. It involves looking at a lot of information and aims to get practical results. Os Keyes thinks data science is about counting people, which is different from the usual idea. She might mean everything can be measured because data science deals with countable things and numbers. Some think data science systems want to measure everything, even human life, and turn it into numbers. When decisions are made, these systems don't consider humans, making it seem cold.
Tests often use a system where people can't share their thoughts. They usually have questions with multiple answers, and one wrong choice means no turning back. This shows that only correct data is accepted, not allowing for mistakes. So people are used to giving the right answers and fear saying something wrong.
On the other hand, data science is crucial in places where errors are dangerous. In healthcare, electronic systems help professionals choose the right treatment and its dose. Mistakes in medication happen because of human mistakes, like forgetting to check if a drug is expired. The system can suggest the best medicine for the patient and make sure it's not expired.
