A lot of old happenings have special names. The renaissance, the enlightenment, the stone age – all named for a specific reason to tell them apart. A big example is the industrial revolution. It was a part of history and a big step in technology and society. It was fast, lasting less than 100 years. The word “revolution” is to show it was a big and quick change in society. It had many effects on people and their lives. It changed how work was done and understood, shifting how people saw the economy, labor, and the world. For people starting businesses, the industrialization was a main focus and income, replacing manual work. It brought new ways to make things on a big scale. Complex machines changed how workers did their jobs, needing more education and skill. It made some lose jobs, but others found work in cities. Cities grew because of the industrialization, becoming places for people to meet. Making things in large amounts helped countries grow their economies, trade more, and connect with neighbors. Despite its good and bad, the industrialization era is important for the society today.
