Yelling was strong and powerful before, now it looks mean and aggressive. It is connected to being too proud and taking unfair advantage. People on the internet reacted strongly to a video of a man yelling at a woman in American politics. This made it clear how people see yelling today. Shouting is now linked to men being too masculine and having anger problems. If someone shouts and loses control, they make others feel surprised and embarrassed. It's not good if you want others to respect you. 
This change is partly because people are moving away from being abusive and favoring men. Even though there's no proof that men shout more than women, a man yelling is usually scarier and more harmful. This change might also be because of how younger people act now, maybe because of the internet. Nowadays, there's less need to shout when you can hurt others through different ways of communication. 
I find it very interesting how people's views on shouting have changed. The meaning of behaviors can change over time, depending on how society is. As people start being more respectful to each other, shouting might not be needed anymore. I hope that people can learn to express emotions without shouting, instead of keeping them inside for a long time.
