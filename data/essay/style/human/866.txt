I want to thank my future generation that they don’t forget my work. This story about love forever is maybe important in your time, so there are a lot of movies and versions of ‘Romeo and Juliet’. The new movie of my play was a bit controversial: the actors seem right for their parts, but the main idea of the play maybe not understood deeply. 

Carlo Carlea’s ‘Romeo and Juliet’ (2013) was recorded in old places and houses in different cities in Italy with few mistakes about history. Some actors did well: Hayley Steinfeld showed that Juliet was like a young girl now, not yet a woman. They changed some parts of the story to help young people understand it better. They also changed some details and cut some lines to keep the strong emotions that people today like. At the beginning of the movie, it’s clear that they changed the prologue. Romeo doesn’t show much love or romance, but he seems more manly in his way of talking, acting, and fighting than in the past. I ask myself if the director and the producers really understood the main ideas of the play. 

They made a movie that, in my opinion, talks about the good and bad parts of people when it comes to love and desire. But when the characters start acting very differently, with strange dialogues and ignoring or changing important topics, the movie stops being an adaptation and becomes more like a joke. It seems like the new version doesn’t deal fully with the challenges in the original play.
