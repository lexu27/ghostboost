The article talks a lot about how COVID-19 affected students in Saudi Arabia. The writers want to show how anxiety is connected to the pandemic. They used online surveys to gather information. They used a questionnaire about anxiety by Zung, which gives different anxiety levels that can be studied along with gender, age, and year of study. This article is very helpful for the research topic because it tells us how the pandemic impacts university students even if they don't get sick. The study's main problem is that they only looked at one university, so the data might not be true for other schools.

COVID-19 was a very bad time not just because of the virus, but also because it made people more anxious and stressed in Saudi Arabia. I won't use this article as the main part of my research, but it will be an important source for information about anxiety.
