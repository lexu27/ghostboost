In article titles and content, we can know what field of science they are about. For example, humanities article talks about how people communicate and feel (Willoughby et al. 1631). These ideas are not exact and relate more to how people see things than exact numbers. Social sciences article already looks at connections between things, explaining how things affect each other (Geist 1). Researchers here use more graphs and numbers and focus on society and money. A natural sciences article doesn't use numbers but studies things through systems and models. For example, Schacht and Kramer look at how human mating affects evolution (2). These articles use experiments to study how humans develop globally.

Different fields of science have different features. Humanities focus on how people see things and ask people questions. Social sciences look for connections between things and use numbers and patterns. Natural sciences need experiments to describe nature or humans.

Articles have different structures based on their field. Humanities articles start with background info, methods, results, and discussion. Social sciences articles have info, data, results, discussion, and a conclusion. Natural sciences articles focus on concepts like monogamy and evolution.

Looking closely at articles can teach us how to write better. Willoughby et al. use their research to test existing ideas about marriage. This helps make the paper more based on evidence. We can learn from this technique to write better papers.

The main difference between articles is their purpose based on the field. Humanities articles explore relationships and feelings about marriage. Social sciences look at marriage in society and how it changes over time. Natural sciences study mating patterns in humans. Each article offers a different view on marriage at different levels - from individual to society.
