Brand name: Glumetza. First, it is given at 500mg every day with food and later changed to 1000mg, 500mg XR, or 1000mg XR. It works by stopping the making of sugar in the liver and lessening sugar absorption in the small stomach, lowering insulin resistance. Common bad effects: feeling full, lactic acid build-up, feeling sick, tummy trouble, losing weight, and not having enough vitamin B12. Also, starting metformin is linked to getting a blood problem called hemolytic anemia (Miller & Fortun, 2018). It should be carefully given to pregnant and drinking patients. In cases like kidney issues, the medicine stays in the body more, causing harm.

To lower tummy issues at the start of treatment, metformin should be taken with food. Once treatment begins with metformin, it should not be stopped unless the patient can't use it anymore (Miller & Fortun, 2018). For people with kidney issues, heart attacks, very high blood sugar, and heart problems, metformin should not be started or stopped if these happen while on the treatment. Metformin should not be given to people with low kidney function. People with better kidney function can safely use metformin (Miller & Fortun, 2018). So, people with lower kidney function should be watched closely when on this medicine. Also, the doctor should check if the good of the drug is more than the risk for people with low kidney function. Checking the kidneys is very important. It is a top treatment along with changing the way of life. When starting insulin, metformin should also be used for body benefits.

Grouped into:
  * Basic: drugs in this group are neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) that starts working in 2-4 hours and works for about ten to sixteen hours. It's strongest at 4-10 hours. It makes night low blood sugar more likely (Gupta, 2022). Another group is glargine, detemir, and degludec, which start in one to four hours and work up to twenty-four hours. They have less chance of night low blood sugar than NPH. Basic insulin stops the liver from making sugar. Basic with meals: includes Regular U 500. It starts in about half an hour, getting strongest after two to three hours. It should be given thirty minutes before eating (Gupta, 2022). These drugs work for a long time. Basic with meals is best for people with a lot of insulin resistance.
  * With meals: includes regular human insulin, which works for up to 8 hours and starts working after an hour. It should be given thirty minutes before eating or there's a bigger chance of low blood sugar. Another drug is aspart, glulisine, and lispro. These insulins work fast. They have less chance of low blood sugar after eating than regular insulin. Human insulin can be fast, middle, or mixed. Fast insulin includes human R and Novolin R (Gupta, 2022). They start working in thirty minutes to an hour and are strongest at two to four hours. The middle insulin works for 12-16 hours and starts in one to three hours. Examples are Humulin N and Novolin N. Mixed insulin has different strengths but starts working from 30 minutes to one hour.
