The paper talks about Walmart, Amazon, and Apple. Walmart is a big American store that likes to help the world. It does things to help nature and give to people who need it. Amazon is also big and helps with things like food and education. Some people say Amazon isn't good to its workers. Apple is another big company that helps with the environment and gives back to the community. People have said Apple isn't always good to its workers too.

Walmart is all about being good and respectful. They say they check any problems that people have. But some workers feel like they are just machines and can lose their jobs easily. Amazon wants its workers to be safe and happy. But some say they work too much. Apple tries to do things right, but there have been complaints about how they do business.

All three companies have different kinds of people working for them. They say they don't care about things like race or gender. They want to have a mix of people from everywhere.
