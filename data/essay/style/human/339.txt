The airplane business has been hit hard by Covid 19. The virus made most countries put rules on traveling (Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Aviation, 2022). These rules made the airplane companies lose money, change how they do business, and how they operate. Passengers didn't want to fly because of tests, less things to use, and not needing to fly for work. The rules also wanted to decrease Covid-19 cases with quarantines. Because fewer people wanted to fly, the companies lost a lot of money ($372 bn), which was a big change for them (Economic impacts of covid-19 on Civil Aviation, 2021).
Flights got canceled, and workers lost jobs because not many people were flying. The companies faced big money problems because of all the bad things Covid-19 did to the airplane business. There were fewer seats available (-50%), and fewer people flew (-2,7 bn) (Economic impacts of covid-19 on Civil Aviation, 2021). But cargo flights were not as affected and sometimes even increased because they carried medical supplies (Nižetić, 2020, p. 10953).
Now, with vaccines and fewer rules, things are getting better in 2021. More chances came because of easier rules, vaccines, and other good things. In the written stuff about this, the lost money in 2021 was a bit less ($324 Bn). Even though these numbers don't look good, 2021 was a bit better, and the future years should be even better.
