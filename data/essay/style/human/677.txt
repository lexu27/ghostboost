This week, we learn about people and culture from the book. Culture is like a map for life and affects how people live. It changes how we act, think, dress, like things, dislike things, deal with society and politics, and talk to others. Knowing this will help me understand and connect with people at work and in social places since cultures make people act differently.

Understanding why students behave a certain way in class is important. The book says that how students act, behave, and react is because of their culture. What is fine for one student might not be okay for another or the teacher. Children start learning their culture when they are born, mostly from family members. This knowledge will help me know my students better and make good plans for them in class.

Even though culture is shared in a community, people in the same culture can still be different. In class, each student shows their unique way of speaking and reacting to things. So, even in families or communities, people can act differently from each other. These differences come from how they grow up and what makes them special. After studying this chapter, I will see each student as special and from a different culture to give them the best help and guidance in class.
