When many people talk together, especially in learning, it can lead to fights and arguments. People who talk a lot or are negative can make the group feel bad (Jacobs et al., 2016). It seems like those who try to show off can make everyone feel upset because they want to impress the leader and talk a lot, which can bother others. This happens because they want attention, maybe because they feel unsure about themselves. That's why they answer all questions, even if not for them. Also, they ask questions that don't make sense to get noticed by the leader.

Talking too much can stop learning well because people get annoyed and don't learn anything useful. Show-offs keep interrupting, making others dislike their behavior (Forsyth, 2019). They can stop the group from achieving their goal by being silly and getting too involved. In general, these people can make it hard for the group to learn well because they want all the attention for themselves and don't let others show what they can do.
