The Persians and Greeks were different in many ways. In Persia, they were okay with various religions and languages, so people from other places could keep their own customs without problems (Brooks, 2019). On the other hand, the Greeks were not as nice to different religions and cultures, making others follow Greek ways (Brooks, 2019).

Another big difference was how the people felt about the king. Persians were happy to help the King and stayed loyal (Brooks, 2019). But in Greece, they liked democracy more and didn't like one person having power over others, with most rich people supporting democracy for fair power sharing.

The governments in Persia and Greece were very different too. Persia had a strong government that could control areas well and leaders with a lot of power like governors and generals (Brooks, 2019). But Greek democracy was not equal and hard to control in faraway places (Brooks, 2019). Persians didnâ€™t tax much, only when they needed money for war. Greeks had a complicated tax system and depended a lot on allies for money.

Athens losing in the Peloponnesian war was a big deal. Athens was like the boss of many places, and when they gave up to Sparta, Greece lost most power, especially in Athens (Brooks, 2019). Some say this made Athens weaker and stopped them from growing bigger, affecting the power balance and how much other Greek cities listened to Athens.
