Organizational structure is a plan that shows how a company's tasks work together to reach its goals. Joseph and Gaba (2020) said these tasks could be rules, jobs, and duties. Also, the chart of management affects how news moves between different parts of the business. In a central system, choices come from the top, but power to make decisions is shared in a decentralized setup. Business layout helps companies be efficient and focused. A growth plan helps companies grow by adding new places, getting new customers, and making more products. So, how a company grows depends on its industry and main customers. This paper talks about how Adidas Company is set up, including its ownership, who runs it, and how it works. Also, it talks about ways Adidas can get bigger by looking at three things outside the company.

Description of the Company
Adidas, or Adidas AG, is a German company that makes sports shoes, sports gear, and other things. The company shortens the name of its founder, Adolf (Adi) Dassler, to get the name Adidas (Adidas, 2022). It was the biggest sports gear maker in Europe and second biggest worldwide in the 2000s, after Nike. Historically, Adidas items have three stripes, seen in the company's logos. Adidas became very successful in the 1950s when soccer players started using the company's light shoes with cleats (Adidas, 2022). In 1963, Adidas started making soccer balls. Adidas was the top brand in sports shoes for many years, but it faced more competition in the 1970s, especially from smaller companies like Nike (Schmid et al., 2018). Adidas' goal is to be the best sports gear maker globally by offering a wide range of products, from sports clothes to luxury fashion, to meet all customer needs and grow the customer base (Adidas, 2022). Adidas AG's main office is in Herzogenaurach, Germany.

Company Structure
The Adidas Group's setup is based on a matrix design. Adidas organizes its staff and resources based on their job and the product they work on. So, people in different departments might have two managers. After finishing a project, the staff will work with other groups. A matrix structure lets different parts of the company work together, get new ideas from each other, and get new skills and tasks in the management team (Jin and Cedrola, 2019). There are three main groups in the Adidas setup: the yearly meeting, the board that supervises, and the top management. The top management controls the company, plans how it works, watches for problems, and follows the rules. The board picks and removes top managers and checks what the top management does.

Ownership Type
Adidas AG Company is owned by the public. That means it is a company anyone can buy shares in. People who own Adidas shares get some of the company's stuff and money. By selling shares on trading platforms, the control of a public company is shared among many people (Silitonga, 2020). Silitonga (2020) said an initial public offering (IPO) is when a private company sells its shares to the public for the first time. If the IPO sells to many investors, big or small, it's called public distribution.

Company Hierarchy
At the top of the company is the CEO, who is in charge of everything and takes responsibility for the whole company. The finance team looks after money and accounting jobs, like making financial statements and giving reports to management. The human resources team hires new staff and makes sure they know their jobs well. The sales team makes sure the company makes money by turning customer interest into long-term business growth. The brand team finds, creates, and sells the company's sports and lifestyle goods by making new products and special moments. The IT and mechanical engineering teams have different jobs. One works on the website and IT, while the other works on machines and operations. They help Adidas make new technologies to be more profitable and efficient. The operations team deals with making products, schedules, getting things, and delivery. They aim to make the distribution chain work better and keep high standards for product quality, reliability, and delivery.

Business Model
Adidas focuses on making new, customer-focused products. Instead of paying for ads, the company wants to show its worth by making a top brand lineup that suits professionals and shoppers (Shah, 2018). It speeds up making products by improving technology, processes, and tools. It also cuts down on different products, organizes the storage, and gives the same service everywhere. The goal is to offer the best brand experience for all customers. New ways of selling products faster have made more people buy Adidas shares, and the company has kept growing every year (Shah, 2018). Being owned by the public has been key to the company's long-term success.

External Factors for Growth
Competition
Adidas faces tough competition from Nike in sports gear, affecting its growth chances. Nike's brand is worth a lot more than Adidas (Ennis, 2020). Nike's way of pricing and offering better products makes Adidas work harder to get loyal customers. Nike makes different products for men, women, and kids, and also makes non-sports items like school supplies. This strategy is better than Adidas' focus on new ideas and products to compete.

Political Issues
Adidas faces problems from changing trade policies and politics in different countries. The company has to deal with these issues to stay global and successful. Trade restrictions and taxes from the US hurt Adidas, a big exporter from Germany. These issues can affect Adidas' sales, money, and brand image.

E-Commerce Growth
Adidas is growing its online sales to reach more customers. The growth in online sales shows in the money earned by online stores. The top online sellers, adidas.com, adidas.co.uk, and reebok.com, have all made more money than before. By mixing online and offline sales into an app, Adidas is growing its direct sales by using new strategies. Studies show this new online-offline plan is working well.

In conclusion, a good company structure helps firms be efficient and focused. A growth strategy helps them expand by adding new places, getting new customers, and making more products. Adidas' structure is based on a matrix design where people and resources are grouped by their job and product. Adidas is owned by the public and run by a CEO who looks after everything. The company's success comes from making innovative products for customers. Competition, politics, and e-commerce are key factors affecting Adidas' growth.
