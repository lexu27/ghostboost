Religion is very important in many countries and cultures. There are lots of different religions in the world with many differences. It is hard to give one definition of religion that fits everyone. Most religions focus on supernatural power, rituals, and moral rules. Some religions are known everywhere, while others are only in one area. For example, Shinto is a Japanese religion that many Japanese people follow. Even though Shinto is from Japan, the story about the gods creating the islands and rulers is like stories in Jewish and Christian religions.
