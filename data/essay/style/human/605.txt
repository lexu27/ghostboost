"Bang Bang Baby" is a movie that mixes science fiction and music. I was surprised by the lively music and the characters in the movie. The main person is Stephy, a girl who wants to be a singer, but her dad doesn't like it. The story happens in 1963 in a small town in Canada and looks like the 1950s-1960s American music style. The clothes, hair, and decorations show the teddy-boy trend from the 1950s.

The movie was not what I expected. Themes in the movie are deeper than they seem. The director made a magical vibe by making Stephy question reality in her dreams. Sleep is very important in the movie - Stephy is bothered when she sleeps. One time she wakes up with a man in her house, and the next time she wakes up, her life is different, and she is going to have a baby. She gives up her dream of being a singer because of tough situations.

The movie has funny dialogues, especially from Bobby Shore, a famous singer. He looks like Billie Joe Armstrong and Elvis Presley. He is clever but seems unclear. One funny thing he says is about casinos and gamblers.

The music in the movie is crucial. There is sad music when Stephy sings at a gas station after she knows her life is not good. The purple fumes from the plant make everything magical. People change in a weird way, like in a dream.

The camera work is special, like in old movies from the 1940s-1950s.
