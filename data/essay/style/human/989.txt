In order to understand how society works, we need to learn many sociological ideas made by different scientists. For instance, Emile Durkheim, a French sociologist, shared his thoughts on society in the functionalism theory. He believed that all parts of society are connected and work together, like a big living thing. He thought that society needs all its parts to work well to stay alive. Durkheim also said that collective and individual behaviors are different, and there is a common conscience that guides how people act.
But not all sociologists agree on this. Karl Marx, for example, made the conflict theory. This theory sees society as always having a struggle between different classes, like the workers and the rich. The main reason for this struggle is the unfair sharing of resources. While functionalism talks about working together and following rules, Marx talks about being independent and feeling separated from society.
Functionalism and conflict theory have very different ideas and goals. Functionalism wants to keep society stable and working well, while conflict theory wants to make changes for society to survive. It's hard to see how these ideas could work together.
