The fun song Debit Credit Theory by Colin Dodds is a good way to remember where debit and credit are. This song also explains what these words mean. It helps me not get confused. The DEAL/CLIP trick by Heather McNellis helps too. This trick explains debit and credit. Debit has Drawings, Expenses, Assets, and Losses. Credit has Capital, Liabilities, Income, and Profits. These two things help me remember accounting basics. They are fun and easy to understand. I think other students will like them too.
