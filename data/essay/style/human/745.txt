This essay will talk about how women are seen in Islam and Christianity. One big worry is how people are treated in the name of religion. Religion is used to hurt women in both Islam and Christianity. I will talk about the differences between them. 

First, I will look at why women are treated badly according to the holy books. Some parts of the Hadith and Quran say it's okay to treat women badly because of Allah (Moore, 2017). This is different from the Bible, which is not as mean to women as Islam. People use texts from holy books to talk about how they treat men, kids, or women.

I will talk about how women are seen in church and mosques. Some Muslims see women as less important, while others see them as equals. In Christian churches, women are often seen as equals or even leaders (Ali, 2018). Women in Islam don't have a big role in their worship places.

I will talk about how women are seen in marriage in both religions. In Islam, men can marry more than one woman if they are fair to all of them. In Christianity, most churches say men should only marry one woman (Lassen, 2021). I will also talk about the roles women play in their families.

Lastly, I will talk about how women are told to submit in Islam and Christianity. In Islam, they say God is a man, so women should listen to men. In Christianity, they say men are the leaders of the family, so women should listen to them. 

Religion can make women suffer. I will try to answer if women are treated badly in both Islam and Christianity. Education and feminists are helping to make things better for women in both religions.
