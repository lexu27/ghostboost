Country I choose for assignment is France. In United States, there are many French consulates. To take remains to "homeland," need to contact special consulate general in California, Los Angeles. Mourner should arrange meeting with specialist two days before to talk about details for sending remains and sealing urn. French Consulate General in Los Angeles is good place to ask for help with "remnants."

I need to give family certain things in future. First, need to prepare package of specific papers like death certificate, medical report, and cremation certificate. Also need paper saying no extra things with urn, no diseases from deceased, and permit to bring remains. Need person's permission for repatriation and French translation of death and cremation papers. Second, family needs urn with ashes in airtight container.

Rules for transporting urn in France are not too hard. Must go to French consulate in US and prepare papers mentioned before. Some airlines transport ashes, Air France-KLM is one of the best. Flight time usually depends on agreement between US and destination country's funeral companies.

Person I talked to in consulate is Julie Duhaut-Bedos. Consulate helps with flight booking. Depending on distance, need to book direct or connecting flight. Each airline has own rules for transporting special cargo. Urn with ashes will be sealed and put in strong box. Can only transport loved one in plane's luggage compartment.
