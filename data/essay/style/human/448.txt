Nurse need to find out Alyssa's health story and results from the body check to suggest right help. Alyssa was told she has a hole in her heart, which might make other heart problems more likely. The girl feels her heart beating fast, dizzy, looks pale, and sweats a lot. She had these same issues before, which means her trouble might come back again. Nurse must check how well the heart works by looking at the heart rate, heart sounds, and calcium level. The body check may show if she has got a heart issue like fast heart rate. This issue's main sign is the heart beating fast. The info from the body check will help decide what help Alyssa needs.

Nurse must help Alyssa and watch her closely. First, nurse needs to check the heart rate and blood pressure. This is important to watch to know if her heart is working well. Second, nurse needs to check an ECG to see how the heart beats. This can show if there are any problems with the heart rate. Third, nurse should let Alyssa rest to help her heart and body. These are three big things the nurse must do for Alyssa.

Giving the right drug - adenosine - is important too. Adenosine helps with heart rhythm issues. It slows down the heart, giving it a break. It only works for a short time and may cause a few small issues like headache or feeling short of breath. Usually, kids don't get this drug unless they had heart surgery or were born with heart issues like Alyssa. Nurse must watch Alyssa after giving her the drug to make sure she's okay.

Nurse needs to tell Alyssa and her family about the medicine before she leaves. They need to know what the drug does, its side effects, how much to take, and if it's safe with other drugs. The medicine, digoxin, helps make the heart beat stronger. It slows down the heart and helps it work better. Alyssa's parents should tell the healthcare provider about any changes in her food or drugs to avoid problems. They shouldn't mix digoxin with certain drugs like St. John's wort or rifampin. Before giving the medicine, the heart rate must be checked and the dose should not be given with food. The dose of digoxin must be right because it's not safe to give too much, especially to kids. So, Alyssa's parents must follow the nurse's advice on how to give it properly.
