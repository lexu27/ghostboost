Consequentialism is a belief about what is right or wrong based on what happens after. Some people agree with letting patients choose to end their lives with help, while others do not. They say it is not good for patients. But others say it is important to let patients decide. 

Some say it is good to let patients choose because it gives them freedom. But a study says many healthcare workers do not think it is right (Dickinson et al., 2002). Others think people do not understand why freedom is important (Sjöstrand et al., 2011). They say if freedom is valued, then helping patients end their lives is not good.

Sjöstran et al. talk about how freedom is important. They look at two ways to think about it in healthcare at the end of life. Some say helping patients end their lives may not be good for them, while others think it is a way to respect freedom (Sjöstrand et al., 2011). They say neither way of thinking is always right since sometimes the bad things that can happen are more important.

Weinstock talks about how to reduce harm without looking at other ideas. This idea has become more important in different areas of policy (Weinstock, 2020). He says reducing harm can be a good way to think about some important ideas and limits. He focuses on what happens after an action rather than arguing about what is right or wrong.

However, some say only looking at what happens after an action can hurt people's rights. Smith talks about a slippery slope argument that says one action will lead to a bad result (Smith, 2005). Some think this argument is not true since there is no proof. Smith says using this argument to stop patients from choosing to end their lives is not fair.

In conclusion, the idea of consequentialism when thinking about euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide is about what happens after. Some say these actions are bad and must be controlled, while others say it is important to respect people's freedom and wishes.
