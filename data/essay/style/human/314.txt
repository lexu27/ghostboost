In the article "The influence of peers during adolescence: Does homophobic name-calling by peers change gender identity?" the authors say that mean names from friends can make people think differently about what gender they are. First, this happens because bad experiences with people of the same gender make someone want to be like people of the other gender. Second, when teenagers are growing up, they are still figuring out who they are. So, they keep thinking about if they are becoming the right person. DeLay et al. (2018) say that being mean to people for being gay can happen to anyone, not just gay people. This may be because the point is to make someone feel bad, not to show real problems.
Figuring out who you are in terms of gender is very important when you're a teenager (DeLay et al., 2018). Since saying mean things because someone is different is a bad thing, schools should not allow it. Ioverno et al. (2021) say that "bullying GNCV might be a way for bullies to show that they are like everyone else" (p. 215). So, it's important to work with bullies in a good way and with a psychologist's help.
Ioverno et al. (2021) also say that this is especially true for boy bullies. That's because they might pick on people who are different like them (p. 216). Understanding how people react to each other is key to stopping gender bullying. Also, bullying teenagers, whether they are gay, trans, or straight, can make them feel very bad and do bad things like use drugs (Valido et al., p. 602). This is a good reason to stop drug use among teenagers. It's also important to see drug use as a problem that comes from their minds.
