A business plan is a big plan that connects a company’s goals and future dreams. After looking at SWOT results, my team made a big plan to help DIVERSICARE HEALTHCARE with money management. We saw the income statement and found out the business needed help with money to avoid problems. We decided to cut costs to make more money. Also, we thought of ways to make more sales. By saving money on labor, insurance, and utilities, we planned to earn more and spend less. This would help the business grow.

Our budget shows how we plan to make these changes. If we follow these plans, we will make a profit of $6500 this year. We checked old and new financial papers to understand the business’s money status. Income and balance sheets help us see how the business is doing. By studying these papers, we can make good money decisions. Financial statements show a clear picture of a business’s money. They help manage income and expenses. The balance sheet shows a business’s equity. The income statement shows how much money a business makes and spends. Looking at all three statements helps us understand a business’s money situation. Analysts should use this data to make good choices for the business.
