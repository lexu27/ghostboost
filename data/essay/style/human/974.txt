In the new world, many people no longer watch news on TV or read newspapers. They prefer social media for news. About half of Americans use social media for news (Walker & Matsa, 2021). Facebook is the most popular for news, then YouTube, Twitter, and Instagram (Walker & Matsa, 2021). People don't trust big news like CNN or FOX. Most Americans think journalists lie or exaggerate (Meek, 2021). So, they look for news from other places. But, online news has problems. It can be biased, and false news spreads fast. Social media news doesn't have many consequences when wrong. It can be worse than big news. 

In your message, you talked about good and bad things about lobbyists helping special groups. They impact voters and decision makers with info and ads (Wolton, 2019). It's important to use these tools well for good results. I agree that lobbyists are useful for groups and can affect new ideas. But, they can also make things unfair, as you said. It's a hard subject, and your post explains it well.
