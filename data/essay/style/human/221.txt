The social networks are getting bigger and making traditional media come second. Twitter is very important for knowing things now and talking about different stuff. But tweets can be different and not always change things in the world. This text looks at Bill Shorten, an Australian politician, and what he said on Twitter about the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS). He talks about a happy thing but also feels bad about the rules limiting NDIS help. His tweet wants to share info and show sadness. He says a girl got help from NDIS but wishes it didn't need public attention to happen. Shorten is not happy with how NDIS can't help many people because of the government's rules. His tweet has both good and bad parts, but it can make a good difference. When a big politician like him says something bad, it can make people and the government notice and fix the problem.

This tweet is important because it got lots of retweets, comments, and likes, which shows it had an impact. But not many people talked about this topic, so its influence is limited. Shorten, as a politician, knows a lot about this topic and cares, so his opinion is important. This tweet can make people talk about NDIS, but maybe not in the whole country.
