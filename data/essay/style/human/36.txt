In not much time, Amazon has changed how people think about buying things online. Before Prime started in 2005, getting things in two days was not common. But now, many people use this service. At first, the best thing about Prime was the free two-day shipping. But as Amazon grew, the free two-day shipping had some rules. For example, the company doesn’t send small things like razors or hair ties on their own. Instead, you need to buy $25 of stuff before Amazon sends them. Customers are unhappy about this. Del Valle (2019) says that Prime is like a trick that makes shoppers feel safe until they see a later delivery date at checkout. This helps the company save money on delivery. To know why, we need to look at Amazon’s warehouses. With the pandemic, more people shop online. Waddell and Singh (2021) say that from 2015 to 2019, Amazon opened about 75 new warehouses each year, from big ones to small ones. In 2020, they opened nearly 300 new places to cut the waiting time for items. Also, we need to think about the quality. According to Organized chaos: Behind the scenes of Amazon’s inventory management system, Amazon made a smart warehouse system that makes delivery faster. Stuff in the warehouse is put not by type but where there is space. This makes placing and picking orders faster. Robots are also used to speed things up. Consumer Reports looked at Amazon’s warehouses and found that most are in areas with many people of color. Also, many are in places with low-income people. This way, Amazon saves money, opens more stores, and meets more people's needs. But some problems come with this warehouse plan. Waddell and Singh (2021) say that people of color and low-income folks have a hard time because of Amazon warehouses. There is more air pollution from trucks and vans, unsafe roads for kids, and other issues like traffic and noise. Amazon is building big warehouses in many places, making existing problems worse.
