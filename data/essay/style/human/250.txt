The study finded that looking at evidence from reviews and studies can help nurses and policies a lot. This can be done by using reviews to make new programs (Benton et al., 2020). The collected studies can be used by nurses to get stronger with evidence for making changes in healthcare. This information can help nurses use good resources when making changes to rules. I believe nursing can get much better with good databases that have research in them. This is because a database can show where we lack knowledge in nursing topics (Houser, 2016). It can also help in areas like nurse education, care for old people, emergency care, and more. 
Right now, it's hard for nurses to get all the information they need because of some reasons. To give nurses more helpful info, we need to make the process easier and use technology. Technology can help share info fast and cheap, which is good for nursing. Evidence-based research can show where we lack info in nursing areas. I think it's important to make this knowledge easy to get and clear to help nursing care and work better.
