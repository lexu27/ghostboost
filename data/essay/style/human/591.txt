Despite team strongness or focus, good support from the boss is important for success. According to Savu (2019), team success needs working together, good leader, and motivation. A study checked how boss support affects work and found a strong connection (Wassem et al., 2019). They said boss help makes workers stay longer and work better (Wassem et al., 2019). The paper will talk about a local soccer team and check how boss talks and leader style affect players’ success. Mr. Albert, the boss, made Eagles United Soccer Club successful by changing the team and helping each player improve.

The club started on January 29, 2017, and has worked for five years. The team has two boards, three staff (the boss, the assistant boss, and the training boss), and twenty-five players. Boards help with risks, money, and choosing the CEO and bosses (Cheng et al., 2021).

In the Eagles club, boards give direction. The bosses teach, lead, and motivate the team. There is a trainer and a food expert to help players get stronger and avoid injuries.

In the first year, Mr. Jones was the boss as the club looked for a new boss. Mr. Jones was good and helped the team start well. In the second year, Mr. Albert became the boss and did a great job. He wanted the team to win a big trophy in two years. He fixed problems in the team and made sure everyone had goals. Mr. Albert was good at solving issues and talking to people.

Mr. Albert gave tasks to each player and told them what he wanted. He gave info to all and liked feedback. He was firm in his decisions.

He left after three years, but he was a good boss who helped the team succeed.

Teams can help a company do better. Good boss communication and feedback are key. A good boss motivates and guides the team to reach goals. Team success needs everyone to work together.
