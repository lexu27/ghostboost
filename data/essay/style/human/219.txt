The project wants to study about why people like different sexes and what makes them like that. Some say you can choose who you like, others say where you live doesn't make you like someone. The second group believes who you like is decided by nature and is a part of who you are, which should be kept safe by the government (Sheldon et al., 2017). To learn more about what people think, the project asks: does where you live change who you like?
While looking into the research, they found two important things about the topic using the GSS database. One is called sexort, which shows who the person likes. The question is: who do you like? This was picked because it helps see the environment around the person. The other thing is called sexbirth, which tells what sex you were when you were born. The GSS question is: what sex were you when you were born (like on your birth paper)? The sexbirth thing was picked because it helps find out about people who like the same sex for the research. These two things are connected and can help with the project. Who people like really matters in their lives. For example, what's around a boy and a girl can be very different. So, these differences in the environment can change how people see who they like.
