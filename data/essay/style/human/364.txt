One of Edward Said’s main ideas in orientalism is that we learn about the East through ideas we make up in our heads, not from real facts. Said’s idea of orientalism shows that Western countries think they are better than Eastern countries (Said 1981). Said notices that how people see the Muslim community worldwide is a lot due to newspapers, mainly from the United States, which show orientalist ideas (Said 1981). This study looks at if Said is right that orientalism is big in newspapers or not. The study answers the question; Was Said right that orientalism is big in the newspapers? The newspapers might be using orientalism to make people buy them.
