Transportation is very important in moving things around the world. Right now, there is a big change happening because of computers in this area. This is going faster because of the sickness that is happening in the world. Using computers is making things faster and giving new chances in transportation like going faster, changing how the business works, and offering more services. Things are changing so fast that transportation cannot keep up and is causing problems in moving things. Transport companies are always moving things. To keep the world moving, we need to use computers for the five ways of moving things we already have. It is hard to think about a totally new way to move things soon, but new technologies like AI are making many new chances in transportation.

New technologies like machine learning, AI, big data, and the Internet of Things are making a new way to manage moving things - Supply Chain 4.0. AI is helping companies make better plans for moving things. The way things move involves many steps like getting parts, making things, moving things, storing things, delivering things, and selling things. Everyone in this process needs to share information quickly and accurately. With Supply Chain 4.0, companies can plan better using facts instead of just what people think. AI can find connections in data that people cannot see because there is so much data.

One good example of using AI in moving things is systems that predict what will happen. Normally, planning routes is based on a few things that do not change much and do not consider what is happening now. AI can include things like traffic, weather, how long it takes to load and unload at different places, and how people affect delivery speed. By using real-time data, this model can plan the best route more accurately and figure out the best delivery time. This helps save money and time and makes customers happy.

Right now, the world market is mostly using a special way of selling things that combines online and offline stores. This makes it hard for customers to tell the difference between buying online or in a store. Because of this, there are more small orders and stores are changing to be both a place to buy things and a place to keep things. So, transportation companies need to make sure things are delivered on time, the supply chain is clear, the product's life is known, and services are good. To do this, they use new technologies like drones and AI. This helps customers track deliveries from home and trust the company.

Using new ways to move things is also making it possible to send things farther. Drones can fly and carry things without needing a pilot, so they can go over borders easily. This helps increase how far things can be sent. Smart roads also help by using different technologies to manage land transport, making deliveries safer and faster.

Using computers for transportation is also saving money. Robots are doing more work like delivering goods and managing supply chains, which means less money is spent on salaries. Even though it costs money to keep up these new technologies, the profit made from using them covers these costs.

Changing the ways we move things around the world is causing a big change in global trade. Making the ways we move things better will help move more things and help everyone involved in moving things. New technologies are being used to make moving things easier and better for customers. So, the ways we move things will be more efficient with the help of AI in the future.
