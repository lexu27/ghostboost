Chapter 5 of book talks about native women in past when Europeans came to America. Many men from Europe met people from Algonquian tribes. These tribes changed a lot after meeting Europeans (Hughes & Hughes, 1997). Before, men and women shared work equally. But after Europeans came, men's work like hunting became more important. Also, trade with Europeans made some women's work less needed. Catholic Jesuits came to make tribe men Christian. Many women didn't want to change religion, but their family punished them.
In New Mexico, Spanish made Indian women slaves for money. In Barbados, black female slaves worked in fields and suffered different types of abuse. In New Spain, Spanish made rules for women to be pure. They often hurt native women to keep Spanish culture. Local people followed Spanish ideas, leading to more harm to native women.
Chapter 6 talks about African women in 17th century. A pastor visited Fetu people and saw how women dressed based on wealth. Rich women wore silk, poor women didn't cover their chests (Hughes & Hughes, 1997). During weddings, men had to show their kindness. Men could marry many times, but first wife was most important. Bakongo tribe had rules for women to be wives or sisters. Wives had children, then became sisters. Sisters had freedom in family matters. Slaves were only wives without freedom.
The chapter also tells about queen Njinga, who fought Portuguese in Kongo. To be queen, she became like a man. She had many husbands who wore women's clothes. Njinga won battles against Portuguese. Book also talks about Eur-African women who were born to European fathers and African mothers. They were not accepted by African people, so they leaned towards European side. They married Europeans and gained power in slave trade.
