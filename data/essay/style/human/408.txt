Marx talk about how people think things are very good because someone work hard on them. This make things more important than people. It also affect how people talk when they buy and sell things. They don't really think about what they need or want. It is important to know that the word "fetishism" does not mean anything about sex; it just means people really like these ideas.

Today, we really like new technology, like how Marx say. For example, Apple things are very popular because they are seen as good and easy to use. The people who make these things work a lot, even if it is not always fair, and this makes the brand look good. Many workers help make the things, and this makes them more valuable no matter how good they really are. The things become valuable because people really like them and because of how they are sold, not because of what they are really worth. The workers also become like things that are sold, just like in the Manifesto of the Communist Party. So, even if they are not really connected, all the important parts of society don't really show how much they are worth.

Marx did not talk about how things get valuable just from how much work is put into them. This is a big problem with his ideas because it doesn't show how to change how much people care about money and things. Marx also didn't say why some things are more liked than others. But, the Manifesto of the Communist Party and Marx's ideas are good to help understand how we relate to money and things today.
