The building industry is changing fast, making better tools for building houses. People are now building houses in a more eco-friendly way, trying to balance nature and money. This is seen a lot in the cladding industry, which helps protect buildings and make them look nice. There are different materials used for cladding, but we don't know which is the best for the environment and easy to use. In 2020, UK experts suggested testing cladding to find the most eco-friendly type. They looked at academic sources, interviewed industry experts, and did surveys to find the best material to use.

They compared different cladding materials based on durability, cost, water and heat retention, how easily they catch fire, and harmful things they release into the air. They got information from official statistics and academic sources. The trends nowadays in cladding include using vinyl siding, sandwich panels, thermopanels, and clinker. Each has its pros and cons, like vinyl is cheap but can crack in hot places, while clinker is strong but expensive. Thermopanels are a mix of vinyl and clinker, being durable and eco-friendly. 

The study showed that wood is the best material for cladding, being eco-friendly and not expensive. Wood is easy to transport, renewable, and meets the green building principles. The construction industry is changing to be more eco-friendly, with houses being built in a greener way. Companies are trying to find a balance between being eco-friendly and making money. Green building is a new trend that focuses on reducing the negative impact on the environment. The UK is a good example of a country following this trend. 

The research project's goal is to find the most eco-friendly and cost-effective cladding material for the UK. They aim to do a detailed review of academic sources, evaluate and compare the literature, and identify the best material for cladding. They want to understand the environmental and economic benefits of different materials and find the one that fits both criteria. 

In general, wood is the best material for cladding, being eco-friendly and cost-effective. It has good properties for building, is renewable, and has low environmental impact. Wood is a valuable resource for building, meeting the needs of eco-conscious communities. Wood has good sound and heat insulation properties, making it a good choice for building houses. Although wood has some drawbacks like being affected by climate and pests, there are ways to treat it to overcome these issues.

Overall, wood is considered the best material for cladding in terms of environmental friendliness and cost-effectiveness. The study showed that wood has unique properties that make it a valuable choice for building houses.
