The story talk about two old ladies, Ruth and Janice, who love each other and live together for 42 years in a small town in the South. But Ruth got very sick from a car crash and now they have many problems in life. Ruth needs a lot of help from doctors and money is a big problem for them. They also have trouble because people don't understand that they are a couple of two women who love each other and have different skin colors. 
After surgeries, Ruth went to a place to be taken care of, but there were problems. The workers there didn't understand that Ruth and Janice were together and the papers didn't have an option for their relationship. So, Janice couldn't be seen as Ruth's family. They had to hide their relationship from others. Janice visited Ruth every day, but the nurses didn't like it. 
Another problem was about money and the house they lived in. They couldn't get married, so if one of them died, the other could lose the house. They had to find a way to keep the house safe. This story shows how hard it is for people who are not like most others. Ruth and Janice had to deal with many problems, but a man named Joseph helped them.
