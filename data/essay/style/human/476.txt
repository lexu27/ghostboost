A plan for danger starts with a pack for danger that must have water to drink for each person, food for a few days, a radio to hear news. It is important to have a light and more batteries if the danger lasts long. Also, the pack should have a mask for dust and a whistle for help. If we can't turn off the water and electricity, we need to have tools to open the food. 
When getting ready for danger, there are other things that affect our actions. There is a person who can't move in the family, so it is very important to have a bed on wheels if we need to leave the house. If we can't use the bed, we need special wraps to carry the person on our back. Also, the pack should have all the things for first aid like wraps, pain medicine, and things for wounds. With these, we can help with different kinds of injuries. One person in the family has a problem with breathing, so we need many pumps in the pack. If they break, we need to use baking powder when they can't breathe well. We put one spoon of powder in one bottle of water; we breathe in the steam for 5-7 minutes. This helps clear the lungs, remove the sticky stuff, and make the breath better when coughing. 
Also, it is important not to get scared, because being calm is the line between life and death. If we lose calmness, we start to do things that are not smart and can cause death. We start the plan by checking the water and food. Also, I need to check that everyone is okay. After that, I will turn on the radio to hear messages from people who help in danger. If we can't talk, it is important to stay calm and use the whistle for help. If we can handle different situations calmly, the plan is working well.
