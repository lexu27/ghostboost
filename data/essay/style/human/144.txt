In his writing, Daniel Spanjer say Christian view has big effect on Liberal Arts. He talk about science and how people come from world - they have feelings and thoughts, which are not just from nature (Spanjer 3). He say why we learn about people and say smart people can answer many questions, logical or not real. These people make a word "worldview" to show all learning, study, experience, and knowledge (Spanjer 15). Sometimes they not agree on answers, but time help them see what wrong.
Another text by Brad Green talk about words and faith together. He say when big ideas and goals mix with language, it good, but when big ideas gone, language not good anymore (Green). God send word to save people; He show people in words (Green). So people should follow God's rules in Bible because His words true. If words have no meaning, talking is not useful.
The last text by Dockery talk about how Christian faith change learning. People told to think in Christian way to make thoughts and beliefs good (Dockery 4). It important to ask God for help and follow His words to help society (Dockery 8). Smart believers needed to make faith-based schools better because only they can do good things. So, Christian view important for good education and learning.
