The problem of companies becoming international is something that many researchers in management have been interested in for a long time. In the last ten years, people have started to look more at how international companies do their work and grow, instead of just thinking about the good and bad things about going global. But we should not forget that the whole world being connected makes a special environment for companies worldwide, with lots of changes and risks and things always moving. 

The main reason why companies want to go global is to get more chances to sell their stuff, make more things, and trade with more people. This also brings good things like making the company bigger, saving money, learning new things, and finding new places to work. Many companies from places like China, India, and Taiwan are part of the big tech world market (Stallkamp & Schotter, 2019).

But this also means that there are many problems for companies in those places. For example, in countries that are still growing, the rules and watching from the government are not strong enough, and this can make big companies do bad things when they trade. For example, some companies use people in poor countries to work for very little money to make things cheaper for people in other countries (Mashan, 2021). This is really bad and will cause big problems for the company later.

Even though going global can be good, some companies choose not to do it for different reasons. One of the main reasons is that they don't want to sell things outside their own country (Paul & Mas, 2019). This means they are afraid of the risks of going global or they only think about their home market. Another reason is that they might know about the problems they would face in other countries, like how people there live, what they believe, and what they do. So, going global has good and bad things that can make companies think twice before doing it.
