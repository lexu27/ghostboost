Introduction
Humans keep healthy by doing good things like eating right. Mothers who have babies in their belly need to eat well not just for them, but for their babies too. Before a baby is born, it's called the antepartum time, and moms are told to eat good food for the baby to grow well. Doctors say eating right is a big part of having a good delivery. Clark (2020) says eating well gives good stuff for both mom and baby. But some women don't eat right because of money, knowing things, or being sick. This essay talks about problems like age, culture, how you live, money stuff, and food issues during pregnancy.

Nutrition Problems
Age Issue: Teenagers
How old a mom is can really affect how she eats. Young girls, especially under 20, don't eat well (Nana & Zema, 2018). Stickler says teen moms have more problems than older ones. Moms-to-be need lots of vitamins and minerals for their bodies and their babies. Teens like snacks and starchy foods like fries, which don't give them all they need. It's hard for a teen to stick to a diet plan compared to a 30-year-old woman. Since our bodies don't make nutrients on their own, we get them from what we eat. If we don't get enough, that's a problem (Nana & Zema, 2018). Teens who are moms face risks like having small babies and early births because they don't eat well before giving birth.
