Ethical egoism is a theory that says it is good to do things that benefit yourself. It does not say you must hurt others to make good choices. Ethical egoism believes actions that help you are right. Another way to think about this is to look at existentialism and hedonism.

When we look at Nora and her choice to copy a friend's work, it might seem like something an ethical egoist would do because it helps her. But ethical egoism does not mean you should always do what you want, especially if it could hurt you later. Nora's choice could lead to bad things like losing trust and a bad grade. So, she must think about what will cause her the least trouble.

Other theories like existentialism also have ideas about Nora's choice. It's hard to say what is right in this situation because the outcome is unknown. Nora could tell the truth or ask for help, but the pleasure of lying might be tempting.

Using drones in war raises ethical questions. While drones keep pilots safe, they can still face mental harm. Making war too easy to start and justifying harm for goals are concerns. Even with drones, wars still have risks and consequences for many people.

Utilitarianism says actions should bring happiness. But it ignores the moral value of actions and focuses only on results. It also assumes everyone's happiness is the same, which is not always true. Utilitarianism also does not consider long-term effects or minority opinions.

Ahmed's actions show how different theories view his choices. Some say it's wrong to share personal data, while others say it's fine if it leads to happiness. But in the end, the consequences might not be worth it.
