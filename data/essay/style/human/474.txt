The using of bug-killing sprays can be very bad for nature and the world because they can hurt health, animals, plants, and where people live. The danger to bees from these sprays shows that too much can really cause problems for plants making seeds and food. People who study this and groups like The Environmental Protection Agency tell the government and companies to stop using bug-killing sprays to keep bugs from going away forever. Changing nature too much can cause really big problems like bad weather, not enough food, and dirty water. So, we need to do things to fix this, like controlling bugs or using smart ways to manage them. Bug-killing sprays are a big problem around the world, so the United Nations, World Health Organization, and World Wide Fund for Nature should do something about it. They can tell people to use smart ways to control bugs so we don't need to use so much spray. It's a good idea to check if we really need bug-killing sprays for farming and find nicer ways to take care of plants. Managing bugs can help the environment, and we need to teach people better ways to do it through studying and programs to show how important bugs are. Some studies have found that a chemical called methoprene can hurt animals it's not meant for. People need to know about these dangers so companies will use less bug-killing spray.
