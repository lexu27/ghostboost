Globalization is when different countries share information, money, trade, and ideas. It helps managers work all around the world, hire people from different places, get materials from good places, and sell things in different markets. Even though this way of working gives many chances to managers, it can also bring problems like keeping information safe and dealing with cultural differences.

Having a global mindset means that managers know how to work with people from different backgrounds. This is very important for companies that work internationally because managers meet people with many different ideas. To work well together, managers need to understand these ideas instead of just thinking about their own country.

The world of business is changing because countries like China, India, and Brazil are becoming more important. For example, China gets a lot of investments from other countries and has many big companies. China makes things, while India does well in services, software, and engineering.

A big company that makes money mostly from other countries is called a multinational corporation (MNC). MNCs work closely with other companies in different places and have one main group making decisions. Managers in MNCs see the whole world as one big market.

Outsourcing is when companies do some work in places with cheap materials and workers. Exporting is when a company sells things made in its home country in other countries. Licensing is when a company lets other companies in different countries use its technology or brand to make and sell products. Direct investing is when a company runs its own factories in another country.
