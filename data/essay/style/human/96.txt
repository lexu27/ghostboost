Introduction
The movie 'Before Night Falls' talks about the sad life of the famous Cuban poet Reinaldo Arenas. He grew up poor and supported the Cuban rebels who liked his writing. He also told everyone about his different feelings. But then his friends, including Fidel Castro, made a law against being gay and put him in jail. After two years, he left and went to America. He found love but got sick. We need to know if Reinaldo chose his feelings or if other things affected him.

Factors Influencing Feelings
In the past, people thought being gay was wrong. Freud said that things in life could make someone like their own gender. Reinaldo had a hard life without a dad. When a teacher praised him, his grandpa got mad. He saw men naked and felt something new. Problems at home might have made him feel this way. Freud thought that social things could change how someone felt too.

Reinaldo's Fight for Rights
Even in prison, he believed he could be free and help gay people. Writers wanted gay rights too. Reinaldo wrote about the government fighting against gay people. He felt treated badly because of his books. His love for justice and equality made his life hard.

Reinaldo's Choice
He knew he might get in trouble but still wrote and talked about being gay. He went to gay places with friends. This was risky but he kept going. Some religions say being gay is bad. Reinaldo had many partners and got sick. This shows he chose this life. Some people say that the Bible talks about gay love.

Conclusion
Freud said that how you grow up can affect who you like. Reinaldo's tough life made him gay, and his writing made him fight for his beliefs. He died young because of all the suffering. Some say being gay is a choice, but others think differently. Reinaldo's life shows how different things can make someone gay and how it can affect their life.
