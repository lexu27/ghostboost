The tough justice system is where the laws are for everyone. It thinks one is innocent till the other side proves it without any doubt. If there is any doubt, it's better for the person accused. They can stay quiet and don't have to answer. 
This system has some moral issues because most of the rules help the accused. The accused gets rights like appeal, to stay quiet, to have a lawyer, and to be safe from wrong searches and arrests. The accused's rights make it hard for the other side, the prosecution, to prove the case. This is not fair to the prosecution and makes its job hard. The system makes the people involved in a case fight each other to win. This makes it easy for tricks and not using facts to solve cases. This can be fixed by letting both sides show facts before deciding to be fair.
If a black man and a white woman do the same bad thing, the black man is more likely to get caught. This happens because of racism in the American system and unfair policing. Also, the black man is more likely to be punished than the white woman for the same crime. A report from the United States Sentencing Commission says a black man can get 20% more time in jail for the same crime as a white man. These differences are because of racism and unfairness in the American justice system.
