It is known that Beowulf is a very old and important poem from Europe. People argue about where it comes from, but many say it is a Danish poem in a type of old English language. The poem talks about a hero named Beowulf who does great things to help people. He helps King Hrothgar of the Danes by defeating a monster called Grendel and its mother. Later, when Beowulf becomes the king himself, he fights a dragon that causes trouble in his kingdom. Even though he defeats the dragon, Beowulf dies because he is badly hurt.

In my opinion, this poem tells us important things about life. One thing is about identity - in Beowulf, people think a lot about their family history. They believe that their worth comes from their ancestors. Beowulf wants to be famous and respected, so he does brave deeds. Another important idea in the poem is about growing up and being responsible. At first, Beowulf only wants to be famous and takes risks. But when he becomes a king, he learns that he must be wise and take care of his people. Also, the poem talks about the clash between personal beliefs and the rules of being a hero, and between Christian and old beliefs. It shows that people can be complex and not always follow strict rules.
