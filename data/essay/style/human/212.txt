Gendered behavior shows how people learn to act like boys or girls when they grow up. I learned when I was young that women usually cook at home. I learned to cook for my family when I was a kid, unlike most boys. The movies also often show women cooking.
One role I learned quickly as a child was that women are good at taking care of others. Women are kind and help others at home and in society. Many people think jobs like nursing and teaching are best for women because they need to care for others.
I liked the idea that women are caring and kind. I believed that women can help make the world a better place by being kind. Even though this role is nice, it can make it hard for women to get certain jobs like pilots or doctors, which pay more. Society often thinks women should only do jobs like nursing or teaching. Many people assume women in hospitals are nurses, not doctors. This can make it tough for women to choose their careers.
