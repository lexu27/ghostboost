On the right side, looking at new information can help make the company better by growing it, making things work well, and aiding good causes. Big information, which is new data, is very important in how the company can stay ahead by guessing what it might need in the future (Khine, 2019). Right now, new data is very important in health care because it helps cut costs and find better ways to work. But to get even better, data can help the company fight diseases, avoid harm, stop infections, and get the best information from what they have.

To make things better at the company, three steps can be used. The PDCA, or Deming cycle, is a way to make things better by finding problems and thinking of good solutions (Hamm, 2016). The Kaizen process helps the company keep getting better by making it a habit for everyone to improve. The Six Sigma process helps get rid of errors and make the business better (Hamm, 2016). Looking at data can help find where doctors are doing well and copy that success. Also, by looking at data, the company can see where doctors need help and use that to make better decisions (Hamm, 2016). In simple words, data can help the business see what works well in treating patients and reduce risks.

The best way to talk to important people about a plan is to have a plan that says why they should be involved. Having a plan helps talk to them and know what might happen. Also, a plan is important because it guides every step from what to say to what could happen (Winter, 2019). But getting everyone to agree might not be easy. Some common problems include different decision-makers, too many things to do, not enough resources, and different ideas and information.

To solve these problems, it's important to think about how to get everyone to agree. This can be done by finding out what everyone wants, listening to them, meeting with them, and seeing what makes them want to help (Bakken, 2018). Also, with help from top managers, it's possible to see how things are going by sharing thoughts with the group and fixing problems.
