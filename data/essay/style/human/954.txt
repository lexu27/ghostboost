The patient's death rate in the special care room is worrying for doctors. There are many reasons for a patient's death even before they go to the special room. Doctors say that putting a tube correctly during saving someone helps the blood move well. We do not know if a nurse knowing about capnography affects using it in the special care rooms. This project wants to see how much nurses know about capnography and if they use it in the heart care rooms. This work will give us good information about why capnography is or isn't used, which helps fill the holes in the books. The plan will teach nurses about capnography and check if they use it in the special rooms. After teaching and checking, the aim is to make using capnography easier in the chosen special room. The plan will also help put tubes correctly to help blood flow during saving, make sure care is good, and help patients get better in the special rooms. The work will ask nurses from a heart care room in Central Jersey to join. This place was picked because many nurses there don't want to use capnography when saving someone. The work will take twenty-four weeks. Only nurses who fit the rules will join, and their test results will be secret and only used to check their capnography knowledge. This project will help make sure people get better by showing proof that capnography should be used when saving someone.
