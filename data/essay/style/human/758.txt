One can say story "Where Are You Going, Where Have You Been?" ends well, shows things happening to Connie in a special way. It shows she might have been killed, as "she felt her breath start jerking back and forth in her lungs as if it were something Arnold Friend was stabbing her with again and again with no tenderness" (Oates). But when Connie wakes up, she feels like she is outside her body.
It is clear she is dead and going to the afterlife, but many questions come up at the end about who Arnold Friend really is, how he knows everything and is so strong? It could be a dream since she went outside and might have fallen asleep because she likes to daydream. The story ends without showing what happens to Connie next, if she is going to paradise, or just a fake paradise made by her killer. Connie seems different spiritually, but we don't get all the details.
One smart thought by Samantha Conover says Connie might have been taken away and something bad might have happened to her. The story doesn't say this directly but hints at it with special words and other writing techniques to show this rich, powerful man who followed her might have been bad. The story is based on a real serial killer who did bad things to young girls before he was caught, showing a pattern of bad behavior when doing bad things to his victims. Connie's story is like many other women who faced bad things, she knew the bad person but not well, she was alone when it happened, even in the daytime when bad things shouldn't happen. Lastly, her weakness and feeling outside her body might mean she was so scared she lost touch with herself (Conover 125). It's a scary, but sadly true story shown through pictures and comparisons in Oates' story, showing it might not be a myth, but a sad reality.
