It is known that many things decide how healthy you are when you buy food. Money and the way you live are two of them, and they affect what kind of food you buy. So, families with not much money like to get cheap canned veggies instead of fresh ones because they don't have a lot of money. Also, people who are into being healthy or doing sports have to buy more natural and pricier food.

Actually, there are many things that can change how you buy food and eat, and this affects how healthy you are. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services says that things like money, education, health care, the place you live, and your community can all affect how healthy you are (Healthy People 2030, n.d.). Looking at this list, we can guess that how much you know can also change what you buy. For example, someone who knows about food and how bad snacks, sugar, and canned food are for you will try hard not to eat them, no matter how much money they have.
