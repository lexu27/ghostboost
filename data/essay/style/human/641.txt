The Alabama State constitution tries to give and protect many citizens' rights. Some of these rights are the same in the American Bill of Rights. The Alabama State constitution is very detailed and has different parts to help and protect citizens. One important part is the freedom to talk. In the Bill of Rights, the first rule protects the freedom to talk. This lets people talk and protest. The Alabama State constitution also supports this and prevents laws that would stop people from talking freely.

The Fourteenth Amendment and Equal Rights Amendment are about stopping discrimination. The Fourteenth Amendment stops discrimination against former slaves. Black people who were once slaves were given equal rights under the law. The Equal Rights Amendment is like an extension of the Fourteenth Amendment. It says all American citizens should be treated the same no matter their gender. When it was written, women had fewer rights than men. So, while both amendments are against discrimination, they focus on different groups - one on race and the other on gender.
