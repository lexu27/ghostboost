In general, many different types of thinking exist and are used, but not all are very important for decisions about patient care. The ways of thinking can be put into groups based on if they go from small details to big ideas or from big ideas to small details, using examples or guessing, breaking things down or combining evidence, and more. In the healthcare area, relying on strong evidence is what tells the professional group how to think about clinical decisions, because just ideas and too much trying new things can be risky for patients. Especially, a kind of thinking that looks at how often things happen is very common in healthcare, especially when making rules, and it needs doctors to use numbers to make decisions (Wieringa et al., 2018). This way of thinking has many good points, like helping to not depend on unsure ideas and making sure all decisions match what is known worldwide in healthcare.

To make clear what the rules for thinking are and to decide how good they are, important questions need to be asked. When making these questions, it might be important to see the difference between thinking that is based on science and thinking that is based on what is right. From a science view, asking questions about how clear the thinking is, if it matches what others found before, and how much it fits with facts about the patient is important to show how good the thinking is. Questions about the good and bad parts of decisions can also help show how good the rules for thinking are. These questions might think about what the patient sees as good in decisions or what the patientâ€™s life and feelings are like when finding an answer. In the same way, how much the important values in healthcare affect the thinking process can show how good the rules for thinking are.
