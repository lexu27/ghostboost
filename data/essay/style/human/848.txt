The colors of skin are very important in the stories of America and Canada. They are still affecting the lives of Black people in both places. Reynolds (2016) says that skin color is not only a big part of the past and culture, but it also decides how history is written and read. That’s why Canada’s rule of having many cultures led to having Black History Month, which started in the United States and is in February. During this time, people are told to join in celebrations and activities to honor Black people and their groups.

In Canada, Black History Month has helped schools talk about being different and the history of African cultures. Prince (2009) says it is very important – but having just one special month is not enough. She remembers going to schools every February to read stories to children, giving them a Black view of their past. Prince (2009) thinks this is just a small thing offered to Black people to be satisfied with and not ask for more. This makes the history of Black people seem like it is in separate parts, which just makes the power of those in control stronger and keeps Black people hidden. For example, once a librarian told Prince to read stories of Anansi instead of her own book because none of the kids were Black, and the librarian thought Anansi was easier. Prince said no, feeling upset because this was an attempt to hide the special stories she wanted to share.

So, having a school plan that includes everyone is not just something to think about – it is very necessary. Instead of talking about the Black view for only twenty-eight days and then forgetting about it, the government should make sure to teach about the world’s past all the time. This will help get rid of bad stories and help people understand how things are connected. It will also make Black children feel like they are seen. For a country that says it likes having many cultures, all of this is really important.
