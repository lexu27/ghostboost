Conflict management at the job is very important. People will argue at work, especially in hospitals. If people don't fix the arguments fast, it can make everyone work worse and feel bad. This can also make patients not get good care. So, it's important to solve arguments quickly. To do this well, we need to know what makes arguments happen.

There are three main reasons why arguments happen at work: because of one person, between people, or because of how work is organized. For example, how a healthcare worker feels about themselves, how they deal with feelings, and how they talk can affect how often and how bad arguments are. Also, things like how old someone is or how much experience they have can change how they act during arguments. Arguments between people happen when there is no trust, when someone is mean, or when talking is not good. Arguments because of work happen when the rules and how work is set up are not clear. This can make people unhappy and argue. 

I have been in arguments because of these reasons. For example, I have a friend who is nice but only thinks about themselves. This makes it hard to share opinions, and we argue when I get tired of it. Also, I noticed that I argue with my family and friends because I can't control my feelings well. Once, I argued with classmates because we didn't talk about who does what before starting a project together.
