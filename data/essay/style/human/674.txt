The stories by Edgar Allan Poe are very interesting and make you think a lot. In his story "Murders in the Rue Morgue," a strange murderer shows how there are problems in solving crimes. The story tells us that paying attention to details is very important. The mystery in the story makes us ask many questions about the confusing evidence and strange things that happened. The main character, Dupin, is like a smart person who can solve puzzles.
When people look at a crime scene, they usually look for evidence. Poe makes it more complicated by giving different facts and clues. He compares this to playing chess, saying that thinking carefully is important in detective stories. Dupin says we should pay attention to small details, like how someone talks or where they stand in a room.
Even though there is no clear reason for the crime, the police still want to catch someone. Dupin thinks it's better to think more and not rush to judgment. Most criminals have a reason for what they do, but this case doesn't have a clear reason.
In the end, when they look at the bodies of the victims, they see strange injuries that don't seem human. The police are confused, but Dupin is calm and thinks clearly about the case. It's like the last move in a chess game to find the real answer.
The murders in Poe's stories are like a special signature. He talks about criminals and detectives in a surprising way. By looking at confusing evidence and strange things, Dupin can solve the mystery. Even though others don't understand how he does it, readers can see that thinking carefully and not rushing can help find the truth.
