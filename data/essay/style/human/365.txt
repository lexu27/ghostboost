Net Present Value (NPV) shows how much money an investor or funder thinks they will get from a project after all costs are paid. This number is like the total profit for the investor when they start getting paid back. NPV helps to see if a project is good to invest in by looking at possible costs and risks. NPV is better than other ways to decide on investments. The rules for NPV include using common sense and thinking about if the investment makes sense. Since NPV looks at time, it is better than just looking at things at one point in time. One good thing about NPV is that it's connected to expected value, which is less than when you first invest. NPV knows that money's value can change, so it uses discount rates to figure things out. By guessing how much money will cost, NPV helps to plan how to make a project profitable. Another good thing about NPV is that it's flexible and lets you think about all projects or just one. NPV also looks at how much money is being put into the project. This shows that NPV is a simple way to guess how likely it is to make money based on the money coming in. In conclusion, NPV is better than other ways to decide on investments. First, it looks at the value of money now to see cash flow. Second, it's flexible and looks at money cost and if the investment is good. Third, NPV is a simple way to look at all investments.
