Imbalances and Excesses Water The food amount was good on the first day, but the nutrients were not spread well. Water should be drunk regularly, at least eight glasses daily. Water helps clean the body, keeps us hydrated, and helps us lose weight (Knight 1). Water is important for digestion and is in all body fluids. No water was included in the diets for the three days. Proteins The proteins eaten on the first day, like cheeseburgers, eggs, and yogurt, were high in calories but well spread. The proteins on the second day, like milk and chicken, also had calories. The proteins on the third day had a lot of calories, which is not good. Proteins are important because they help build cells. The body needs protein to heal and make new cells. Protein sources should not have lots of calories as they can make us gain weight and be unhealthy. Eating more calories than we use makes us gain weight. Gaining weight can lead to health problems. We should eat fewer calories or exercise more to stay healthy (Villegas 30). Few protein sources like chicken and yogurt were eaten in two days. Potassium Potassium is needed by all body cells. It helps with cell actions and is important for muscles and heart. Vitamins A and E Vitamins are low in the diet because fruits and veggies were not eaten much. Vitamins help prevent diseases and boost the immune system. Fruits before meals can help increase appetite. Iron Cereals on the second day are the only iron source in the diet. Iron is important for making blood and is in red blood cells and muscles. Calories Calories were too high, and it’s good to exercise to use them up. Junk food has lots of calories. Calories give us energy, but we should have them in the right amount. Zinc Zinc is important for the body and can be found in foods like chicken and red meat. Proper Diet Recommendations Avoid canned foods, eat fresh foods, and whole grains. Breakfast is important for a good start. A balanced breakfast with eggs, milk, whole wheat bread, fruits, and coffee is good. The rest of the meals should have calcium, potassium, Iron, and vitamins. Iron sources include liver, beans, and red meat. Calcium is important for bones and teeth, found in dairy and fortified products. Potassium and sodium are needed, but in different amounts. Sources of potassium include vegetables and fruits. Summary A healthy diet keeps us healthy and prevents sickness. Eating a variety of foods is important. Healthy habits from a young age help in adulthood. Nutrition education is crucial for food safety and reducing hunger. It’s important to test canned foods to keep consumers safe.
