The story happened in the Bronx in 1977. At first look, it may seem like a story about a young boy named Zeke trying to impress the girl he likes, Mylene. But Mylene doesn't notice Zeke because she loves singing a lot. But even the first episode can make people think about the problems in American society in the middle of the 20th century. It shows the hard things that people in poor areas faced, like not having much money or jobs and lots of crime. Also, the first episode shows how young people and their parents think differently. This is seen in the fight between Mylene, who wants to be a famous pop singer, and her dad, who only likes religious songs. The fight gets worse when Mylene goes to a club to show her music to a music boss, even though her dad said no.
The episode's name, "Where there is ruin, there is hope for a treasure," makes you think about what kind of treasure might be hidden in ruins. The main characters in the series, Zeke, Mylene, Shaolin, and others, are very talented. Zeke writes nice words, Mylene sings beautifully, and Shaolin is a good leader who can bring people together. But it will be tough for them to make it in the music world because they are from a poor place and don't have connections there.
