Main difference between different ideas about men and women is how they explain why men and women act differently. Some say men act badly because they are made that way, while others say it's because of how they learn and copy behaviors from others. One idea says men are naturally aggressive and competitive, but many now agree that how we are raised plays a bigger role in causing bad behavior. Another idea says men act the way they do because Western cultures teach them to be aggressive. The key point is where these ideas look for answers.
Knowing and understanding these ideas about men and women is important for teaching. It's hard to help with bad behavior if we don't know why it happens. Also, some old ideas that are not popular in science can still influence how people think. For example, some still believe in old ideas that link men's behavior to their biology, even though many criticize these ideas. So, knowing more about these ideas is important to understand why people act the way they do.
