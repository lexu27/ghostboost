Reliance on internet and mobile phones for business makes E-commerce. The term is not very old, starting in the 2000s after the internet changed things. E-commerce is a big deal now and will be in the future because it has many good things. For example, it helps to avoid expensive traditional stores, which is good for many investors. Also, E-commerce has special things like easy entry and many online customers, which people like. This came at a good time because people are busy, and local producers can't keep up with the demand.

Many people like E-commerce because they don't have to go out to buy things anymore. Especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, people had to rely on the internet for everything. Businesses had to go online to survive, and people depended on technology for everything. This made people like E-commerce even more, even though it can have bad effects on the environment.

E-commerce helps the environment in some ways. It reduces the need for big offices and less travel, which is good for the environment. Also, it saves paper waste and uses digital storage instead of big warehouses. But E-commerce can harm the environment too, like with too many delivery vehicles causing pollution and lots of packaging waste.

So, E-commerce has good and bad effects on the environment. It is important to find a balance to protect the environment while still using E-commerce for business.
