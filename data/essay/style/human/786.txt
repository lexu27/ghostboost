Global organization is not always safe because it is in one country and has places in other countries. Global groups are less affected by small problems than groups in one country. Groups in a few countries have many clients, so they can earn money. But, global companies have many dangers that can hurt business. Programs for local markets might not work well for big companies.
Clients are strongly affected by culture. When a group goes to a new market, plans should change to fit local ways and habits. For example, products, prices, and ads should change. If local ways don't guide plans, foreign groups may fail. Costs in foreign markets can be very high.
Translating is important for businesses going global. Applying global programs can be bad. Success needs thinking globally and locally. Glocalization mixes global ways and local ways. Global ways are the same everywhere, while local ways fit specific markets. It knows that money is limited by stubborn cultures. Limitation projects are common, translating lots of text into different languages for worldwide use.
A big risk for global companies is underestimating new markets due to their own experiences. New markets have less information and more sales changes, leading to failures. Success needs understanding local customs. Without this, new players can struggle.
Cultures see family and business differently. In the US, hiring family might be wrong, but in Latin America, it's normal. Small US companies may not hire family, but global companies in Latin America and the US might. From finances in South America to resources in Asia, global business has many risks.
Global managers must understand cultural differences to make good business decisions. To help partners well, local businesses need smart strategies. A good program may use efficient ways, good work conditions, skilled workers, and smart marketing.
