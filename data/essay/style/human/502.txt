The HOPES (Homicide Outreach Project Empowering Survivors) is very useful for people who experience attacks. Karmen says victims have a profile and might get attacked again if they don't make a protection plan. People in big cities are more likely to face violence like robbery or homicide than those living further away. Programs like HOPES help answer why these cases happen a lot in their area. They show how safe a place is by looking at things like drug problems and police presence. This helps possible victims decide on where to live and how to avoid violence.

The writer says the law doesn't always protect victims from more attacks. It's important to know that women are usually seen as rape victims. Studies like the one by Kopel in 1987 (Karmen, 2020) don't talk much about men who are victims, showing a problem with the system. Even though men are also victims, they aren't counted in the data. It's also crucial to know that black people are more likely to be victims of crime than white people (Karmen, 2020). Knowing this helps programs like HOPES focus on certain communities and give them help.
