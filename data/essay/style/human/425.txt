"The Passing of Traditional Societies" is about things learned from talking and visiting places like Turkey, Lebanon, Syria, Egypt, Jordan, and Iran for ten years. The writer thought that as countries change to be more modern, they follow a path set by Western countries that modernized first. This way of life, called the "Western model" by the writer, is actually worldwide, not just Western. The North Atlantic countries were the first to become more secular, urban, and industrial. In his study of how lifestyles change with time, the writer focused on how people move more, learn to read, and use mass media.
The writer also talked about things that stop modernization. One big problem he mentioned was ethnocentrism. He said, "The West influenced the Middle East by changing its traditional ways to become more modern and work better" (Lerner 47). The writer compared different societies and said that focusing too much on culture can slow down progress.
I think this idea of modernization, made to help move from old ways to new ways, was made after World War II. The modernization theory, though, is too simple and sees history as one straight line with no other options (Dunmire 23). The writer's idea doesn't explain how countries like China, Russia, or Cuba develop, so it's not so useful today.
