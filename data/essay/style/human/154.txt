In history, computer is very important invention. Many people use computer in home and office. Some say computer is good for us, but others say it make life hard. I think computer give us many good things like fast talk and easy find information.

Computer help us talk quickly. Now, world is very connected and computer help with that. Before, people use mail for talk (Grudin, 2017). If a business person go to different country, sending information take very long. This is bad for business because time is very important. Internet make it so we can send messages fast. Workers can send emails or messages to boss anywhere in world (Grudin, 2017). This make business work better and give more chances.

For me, computer is very important and fun. Computer is good for fun times. Watching movies and shows on computer is easy and nice. Also, my job make money and I need computer for that. Computer is not only for fun, but also for work.

Doctors use computer for many things. Computer help with diagnosis and treatment (Farinella & Marco, 2018). Machines like computed tomography give clear pictures of inside body (Farinella & Marco, 2018). Ultrasound show images of organs. Computer help make diagnosis and treatment easier.
