The Zulaika (2022) article talks about how COVID-19 lockdowns in Kenya affected teenage pregnancy and school dropout among secondary school girls. Teenage pregnancies increased when schools closed from March 2020 to January 2021. Zulaika (2022) studied how the pandemic affected the health of young people in Rarieda subcounty. Health leaders didn’t focus much on helping pregnant school girls. Teenagers don’t know much about sex and ways to stay safe. It’s important for health leaders to care about this issue because early pregnancies can harm girls and cause problems later on. If more girls get pregnant young, there will be fewer educated women in Kenya. Pregnant teens feel a lot of stress which can make them sick mentally and physically. Zulaika (2022) suggests teaching girls in school about sexual health and its effects. The article warns that diseases can spread fast if girls don’t understand how important contraceptives are. It’s necessary to educate students and parents about these issues. COVID-19 has worsened teenage pregnancies, creating more problems for the girls, their families, and the whole country.
