In Plato's book, there are three ideas about what piety is. Euthyphro starts with a small sense of being good. But Socrates, who likes to look at things broadly, says piety is more about being good in life, not just following rules. The first idea shows Euthyphro thinks piety is doing what he's doing now, blaming his dad for a crime. He says being pious means doing what makes gods happy.
On the other hand, what makes gods unhappy and they don't like is not pious. Socrates doesn't agree with what Euthyphro is doing because it's just one example of being pious, not the real reason behind being good. It's important to know that gods have different opinions. So, they like and dislike different things at the same time.
Euthyphro gets surprised at one point, so Socrates reminds him of the things he said before. He said gods like something because it's pious, which means they like it because it's good. Socrates thinks gods liking something is just part of the feeling, not the main thing. So, Euthyphro really wants to know what piety is, but Socrates doesn't agree with what he says. After trying many times, Euthyphro leaves without finding the answer.
