The clothes business has many companies that compete. They make similar things but try to be different with their branding and ads to be better than others. They use designs, materials, and prices to be special. In ads, they show different colors, designs, stretchiness, and sizes to stand out (Davis and Özgür, 7). They also say things like getting money back, being good quality, free shipping, and lasting long in their ads.
Steel making is an example of a market where a few big companies rule over others. They set the trends and prices and work together to do well (Ritz 185). They make better products, change prices, and talk about what makes their products special. In this market, if one big company makes prices lower, the others don't copy but make their products better instead (Ritz 187). They keep the industry tough to get into by making the best products, selling them for more, and making a lot of them (Ritz 189). This way, new or small companies are scared to compete with them, so they don't join the market easily.
