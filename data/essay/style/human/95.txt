World history is like a big book full of smart lessons for people now. Many things to learn about old times are available all the time for everyone. One thing to watch is a video called "BBC Ancient Greece: The Greatest Show on Earth – Democrats – 1/3" (Maximus, 2013). The person in the video talks about why plays were important for people in old Athens. At the start of the video, the speaker says we need to know about old Greeks to know about us. This means history happens again and again, and we have same issues as those who lived long ago. History repeats, just like fashion. So, by learning about old Greeks, lots of people today can see themselves in them.

The video says theater's meaning was very different then than now. Today, plays are for fun and relax. Long ago, Athens used plays to share news. The city made theater a key part of its democracy – people played out politics on stage (Maximus, 2013). For Athenians, theater wasn't just a picture of their time; it was where they made politics real. Athens' story is about surviving in a tough world that always changes. The video tells the exciting story of how theater began and how plays helped Athenians understand their tough life.

From this, we learn that old times are like our own. Like Athenians, we also follow news from political talks and debates. Our democracy shows up when we watch, just like before. This shows that history repeats, making us think about where we fit in the big world of politics.
