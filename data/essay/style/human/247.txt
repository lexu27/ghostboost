The Europe people took big parts of world, like Caribbean. In 15th century, Europeans said they own region after Spanish made places to live and beat Aztec and Inca empires (Horne, 2018). Because of the beat, Spanish could get into Mexico and Peru by exploring in important spots in Caribbean area. After Spanish got into Caribbean in 17th century, other Europe people such as British and French started living in important spots like Tortuga and later went to Jamaica (Horne, 2018). By middle of century, many people from different places started colonies and places to trade in Caribbean islands.

The making money in wealth made conquest in Caribbean area grow. First, it was easy to get gold, which was very important in this area. Christopher Columbus showed how to make colonies in this area (Horne, 2018). Second, many people from Africa were made slaves to work in industries in that place.

When Spanish power went down in that area because less people were there, other Europe people increased their presence in places Columbus went to. For example, Francis Drake from England attacked many Spanish places (Horne, 2018). French, British, and Dutch working together made Europe people conquer big part of Caribbean. When colonies started to compete, big wars started and islands in Caribbean couldn't get together to fight Europe people (Horne, 2018). Because farming started, many Africans worked for Europe people in Caribbean, making their power there stronger and conquering the area a lot.
