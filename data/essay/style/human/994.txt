Unfortunately, old women might face a problem with menopause. So, it is important to think about what things could make this problem worse. The person who wrote the post says that their patient with too much weight and a chance of breast cancer should use Metoprolol instead of Norvasc to help with the signs of early menopause. Also, it is good to eat well and stop smoking. These ideas should work well because they match what the patient needs.

When a woman goes through menopause, doctors check her hormone levels and BMI to see if there could be a serious problem. Recent studies say that after menopause, the hormones in a woman's body might make her more likely to have heart problems later in life. So, it makes sense to stop taking Norvasc because it can cause heart issues in the future by making the patient less active. Metoprolol, which is a beta-blocker, seems like the right choice in this case.

But before deciding on a diet, it's better to think again about the patient's weight. Banack and their group studied this and found that using a BMI of 30 kg/m2 might not be the best way to know if a woman is truly obese after menopause. This means losing weight quickly might not be helpful and could even be harmful. The same goes for using HRT because the patient might have a chance of getting cancer. Doctors say that using SSRIs/SNRIs might be better for reducing hot flashes and are safer than HRT for women who want to avoid its risks. So, it's not a good idea to use HRT because it might raise the risk of cancer.

In conclusion, the suggestions in the post could help treat the early menopause symptoms well. Switching from Norvasc to Metoprolol seems like a good idea. When it comes to HRT, it's really important to lower the risk of cancer. That's why using SSRIs/SNRIs might be the best way to treat hot flashes. Still, it's important to rethink the diet plan based on new information.
