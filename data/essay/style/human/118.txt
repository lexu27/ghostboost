Every business must be managed very carefully, and every small thing must get much attention. In healthcare, places like hospitals need even more attention because they help people stay healthy. Doing these jobs can be hard, costly, and need a lot of thinking. As a Chief Nursing Officer, you will deal with important rules like being honest, managing money, and helping workers stay happy in the job.

First, healthcare places must keep being honest. It's clear that in any job, talking well is important, so honesty is very needed. In my workplace, all doctors follow rules about being good, like keeping patient secrets. Also, doctors and nurses talk openly with patients. For example, I tell patients the truth about their health and answer all their questions.

Another big rule is managing money well. Hospitals need new things and repairs often, so they must manage money carefully. It's crucial to make changes quickly to keep patients safe and healthy. For instance, I had to organize getting new power generators as a CNO. Thanks to that, staff could work during a storm and power cut without problems.

The last rule is taking care of workers and making them feel happy in their job. In a hospital, it's vital to reward workers and show appreciation for their hard work. Workers get extra time off and gift cards in my workplace. This helps them feel supported and listened to. If not, nurses and doctors can get very tired and stop doing good work.

So, these rules were picked because they help workers and patients a lot. By following these rules, good things happen and everyone is happy. These rules matter to me because I think healthcare should be based on them. Otherwise, hospitals won't treat patients well, and there won't be trust between workers and patients.
