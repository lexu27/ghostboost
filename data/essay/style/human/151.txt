Commitment to health theory is a special idea to find out the different steps of growing up and how people change what they do. This idea thinks that inside, a person grows and wants to live in a healthy way even if some things make it hard. Also, with this idea, we can know how healthy a person is at a specific time. The theory also says that things like being a man or woman, or being from different places, don't matter when making choices to live healthy. In her study, Kelly (2008) uses the ideas of the Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change. The main reason for this is to show the steps of how people change. Also, the model gives a list of things to do to be healthy. So, the Commitment to Health Theory uses ideas like steps of change, making important decisions, and believing in yourself (Prochaska & Velicer,1997). Because of this, Kelly uses the basic ideas of this theory, and they are all connected.
When it comes to doing advanced nursing work, this idea can help check some things about patients. So, this plan will help know the goals a patient needs to want to live in a healthy way. In real life, this idea will also help see how a patient changes and how to act with them (Kelly, 2008). For example, in the first step, the job is to make the patient feel sure and show why it's important to change. In the next step, ways are used to make the patient want to be healthier. The last step is the end, and it should teach the habits someone needs to stay healthy. So, people who work in health care can use the steps of change and how much someone wants to change to make treatment just for them by using special ways to make changes and encouraging good talks.
