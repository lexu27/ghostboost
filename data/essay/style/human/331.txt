With the paper telling things about HP, it could help an investor to think well about important risks and money signs before deciding. HP has two big risks now, Covid-19 and depending a lot on other suppliers (HP Inc., 2022). For investors, knowing risks is key because changes can mess up things like getting stuff and sending them out. 

Money Situation
Compared to last year, HP got 12.1% more money from selling laptops and supplies. Look at the 10K Form from HP Inc. (2022), you'll see the big money part went up by 2.7%, thanks to good foreign money and many HP workers doing work from home. The profit part is 10.24% ($6,503 million profit; $63,487 million total money). With how things are now, this 10% is very good, as small companies might not do as good in the pandemic. Getting money from angel investors seems like a good idea because they know many people and have good links with other people (Di Pietro, 2021). But getting help from angel investors might be tough for HP and keep a good friendship with them. Getting money from selling stocks looks good too, as it helps against prices going up and gives more money from profits and price going up (Singh, 2021). But HP might lose its way of getting stuff and have to battle against pros and big investors. 

Stock
Look at Figure 1. HP Inc. stock price over six months.
From Figure 1, you see HP Inc. stock price went up in December 2021. The main reasons for this are a big PC market and a stable money part. This happened because of the pandemic and the need for good hardware for workers all over.
