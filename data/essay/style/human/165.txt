It is clear to people now and in the old days in the 1930s that the Second World War had to happen. Some think America could stop the war, but it was hard for some reasons. The U.S. government at that time only cared about America and did not want to get involved in other countries' problems. This time was tough because all countries had money problems. Americans wanted to focus on their own issues, like stopping ideas they didn’t like. It is important to note that America was not very powerful back then, so it couldn’t do much in Europe. America was not rich enough to make a big difference. Also, America alone could not stop the war because it started because of fights between European countries. The Treaty of Versailles made things worse, and everyone was unhappy. Germany got ready for war and joined with other bad countries, so no one could stop the fighting. All the new leaders in Europe were ready for war, so it was going to happen no matter what. So, even if America had tried to help, the war would have started anyway. But America did a lot to help end the war and make a new world order.
