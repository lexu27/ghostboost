God is like a big boss who watches people and gives prizes or fixes things if they talk to him and believe. Some people say God is not real because bad things happen, like wars and attacks where innocent people die. They say this does not match with what is written in holy books. It can be argued that God is like a supervisor; if someone doubts this boss exists, they might do bad things.
But Godâ€™s court is not the only court that can punish someone. So, even if God was not there, people would still follow other rules. Both heavenly and earthly punishments stop people from doing bad stuff. It is important to talk about different religions, like Christianity and Polytheism, where good and bad are seen differently. For example, using magic is not allowed by God, but it is okay in some other religions. Christianity has the same rules for everyone, but Polytheism gives special treatment to some and is controlled by the gods, which is not fair.
