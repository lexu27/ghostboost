It is very usual for companies to grow in different ways, so there are many ways that companies can change. It often depends on the boss, the business type, goals, and what the boss sees. These different types have their good things, bad things, and things that are hard. For example, many companies have problems when they give work and then make sure all the work is together right after they give jobs to groups of workers. The first thing is called differentiation, and the second is called integration, and both are very important for the company's structure.

First, differentiation is when a company separates into parts like groups or sections. This is usual in big companies because when a company gets bigger, it is harder for one boss to control everything. So, companies that are very different let groups do their work alone, which makes it easier to make everything work well. Sometimes, the company's atmosphere and culture can be very different in different groups, which can cause more problems. Companies like Amazon and Apple do this well and have many different parts.

Also, when companies do differentiation, they still need to do all the work well, so integration is also important. Integration is when all the different parts work together well. So, a company that is very integrated can have many different groups that are still close together and not very independent. For example, McDonald’s is a very controlled company, and most important decisions are made by a small group of bosses. Both integration and differentiation are very important and should be in all companies to work well and be better than other companies.

When it comes to integration, it is important that companies choose between two options. Their choices should depend on the business type, how different they are, how good the bosses are, and other important things. Companies can make groups and individuals work together in two ways: up and sideways. The first is very strict, while the second is more relaxed, simple, and flexible.

Up integration is when the bosses at the top use rules, power, and planning to make sure all the workers do their job right. For example, the bosses have to make sure that what the workers do is what the company wants. They make choices, solve problems, check work, and reward or punish workers. They also make rules, policies, and plans so that the workers know what to do. As said before, everything at McDonald’s is decided by a small group of bosses, so we can say that this company uses this type of coordination.

Sideways integration uses meetings, groups, and networks to make sure all the groups work well together. Groups meet to talk and help each other with their work. Informal meetings let workers from different groups talk about things. Also, groups of workers with different skills work together when they need to solve a problem fast. The animation company Pixar is a good example of a company that does this well: the informal link between workers lets them have more ideas and solve problems quickly.
