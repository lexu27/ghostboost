The nursing idea is about making things better all the time. To do this, we need to follow the health trends that match with what people need. One way to make sure we give good care is to look at the latest smart findings and change how we care for patients at work. This is called evidence-based practice (EBP) (Wilson & Austria, 2021). Right now, nurses are not using EBP a lot for a few reasons.

First, many nurses are too busy to learn and use EBP. McArthur et al. (2021) say that having the right tools helps nurses use EBP. These tools include things like “cost and lack of stuff, bad communication, staff changes, and not enough guidelines” (McArthur et al., 2021, p. 20). Because of this, bosses make rules based on what's happening now, not what could happen later. Another big problem is not having good teamwork and support at work (McArthur et al., 2021). Since these are just a few of the many problems, we need to help nurses use EBP.

One way to help is to have leaders who show how to use EBP and give training. Another important thing is to give nurses access to good sources like databases, Internet, and good publications at work. This way, using smart research will be easier and less stressful for nurses.
