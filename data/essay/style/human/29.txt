To study what the rules are about the opioid problem, show examples of the problem, and offer ideas to help fix it for the group in the area. A group of people in the area, including local leaders and citizens. America has a big problem with people using opioids too much. In just one year, in 2019, opioids made 50,000 Americans die, and the money trouble from this problem is about $78.5 billion every year (National Institute on Drug Abuse, 2021). This issue worries many people, from the community and medical staff to policymakers and people from different groups like the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) or the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). Even though different groups and businesses are trying hard to stop the problem, communities can also help a lot to fix it. Everyone here can learn and do more than now, and then the community will save more lives. Today, I will show a talk and study of rules against the opioid problem, think about examples of the problem, and suggest a few things that communities can do in this fight.

It is important to say that there are some main ways to do political things in the fight against the opioid problem. Important people like the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and National Institutes of Health (NIH) focus on things like:
  * Making it easier to get treatment, stop problems, and get better;
  * Tell people about drugs that stop overdoses and make sure people use them;
  * Watch health quickly so that we can see what is happening and understand better;
  * Help with studies to know about pain and safe ways to handle it;
  * Say yes to different ways to reduce pain (Collins, 2017; NIDA, 2021).
Most groups fighting the problem are working on these things. Groups include Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), CDC, Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and others. Some groups have their own ideas; for example, the Healthcare Fraud Prevention Partnership (HFPP) also wants to find and stop cheating and other bad things with opioids (Healthcare Fraud Prevention Partnership, 2017). Programs in the States watch drug prescriptions and how pain doctors work (CDC, 2019). So, all the things are meant to make it less likely for people to use opioids too much and keep the country healthy.

The talk is about understanding and looking at how well the rules work to help make good choices for new rules and actions. By looking at the rules we have now, we see some good things. Some good things are:
  * State programs in Ohio, Kentucky, Florida, New York, Tennessee, and other states helped make fewer people use opioids and die (CDC, 2019);
  * SAMHSA gives training money and Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT) for people who are at risk;
  * The CDC does and helps with studies that give new knowledge on things that make risks and other important things and offer answers.
But we see that the problem is still there. In some cases, the rules make people use other drugs that are not opioids because they do not pay enough attention to why people use too many drugs (Lee et al., 2021). So, the fight against opioids should be big and have plans to make social things better and help the community more.

Let us think about some times when the opioid problem showed up, which can help us make rules to fight it. Times are:
  * The opioid problem started in the late 20th century when drug companies told people that painkillers with opioids would not make them want more and gave them a lot (NIDA, 2021);
  * About 21-29% of people with prescriptions for opioids because of long-lasting pain use them wrong, and 4-6% of them later use heroin (NIDA, 2021).
  * 8-12% of those who get opioids from a doctor have a problem with using opioids too much (NIDA, 2021);
Things that make you more likely to get addicted to opioids are using drugs in the wrong way or for too long, not having money, not having a job, having a history of using drugs in your family or yourself, doing risky things, meeting people who are not good, being stressed, and other things (Mayo Clinic Staff, 2018).
By knowing about risks, reasons, and things that make the opioid problem worse, we can say some things that communities can do. Things to do are:
  * Work together to tell people about the dangers of opioids, rules to fight the problem, ways to help, and how to help if someone takes too many drugs;
  * Make a group or team that can help people who have a problem, especially by saying where to get help, giving drugs that stop too many drugs from hurting you, and other things;
  * Make groups to help in different places for people who have a problem, people who have a lot of pain, and other things that make you more likely to get addicted.
Things to look at when seeing if the rules we suggest are good include:
  * People knowing about the dangers of opioids, rules for the problem, and people able to help and do things;
  * Helping people who have a problem with using opioids too much;
  * Having drugs that stop too many drugs from hurting you and giving them to people who need them;
  * Groups that help with things that make you more likely to get addicted and help you feel better.
In the end, we have to know that the opioid problem is very dangerous for Americans. It started because people were told wrong things about drugs with opioids not making you want more. But using these drugs can make you addicted and have other problems. Many groups and people have done a lot to fight the problem. Important things are making sure people do not get too many drugs, finding other ways to help with pain, and other things like that. Communities can help a lot by telling people things, helping those who have a problem with drugs or a lot of pain, and doing other things. So, everyone here can do things to help and save lives.
