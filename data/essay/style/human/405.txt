The heater and pump use electricity from a generator to keep the oil warm in a tank. When not used for a long time, they work to prevent the oil from getting cold. The pump moves the oil from the tank through a heater and back again, keeping it warm. The heater warms the oil in the tank, so it doesn't get cold.
