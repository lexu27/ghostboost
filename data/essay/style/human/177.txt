The idea of culture is very important for people. It affects how we do things and how we talk to each other every day. Roseberry says that culture is made by society and is a big part of everything we do. This means that things like power, money, and history are all part of culture. Culture also affects how we make decisions in politics and history. It even affects how we do business and manage money, based on the beliefs of the culture we belong to. By knowing about history and politics, we can understand culture better. 

Roseberry also thinks that culture is made by society, so many cultures have similar beliefs and values. In my culture, me and my friends have similar ways of thinking because we live in the same place. But in the world, people from different places have different beliefs and ways of making choices. This is because culture is social and special. It involves different views shared by people from the same area and changes how they think. So, we can say that culture is made by society and affects how we interact and do things every day.
