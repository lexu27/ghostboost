English is a simple way to talk with people from different places. Many people keep their accent even after learning English for a long time. This can make some people treat others unfairly, especially native speakers. They start changing how they talk to be more unique, especially in creative things. Accents are hard to get rid of when speaking another language because our ears are used to hearing certain sounds when we are little. It is important to know that having an accent is normal and not a reason to be mean to someone. It can actually help them get better at the language.

Multiculturalism means different cultures living together, but some people push for everyone to only speak English. They want one way for white and African American people to speak. Efforts to stop racism in the country have not worked well. In today's study of language and society, they look at how language shows power between different groups of people.

Feeling like you don't belong in American society can create problems between immigrants and Americans. Things like skin color, eye size, and nose shape can keep immigrants separate from everyone else. Even though things have gotten better recently, there are still problems with language discrimination, especially for people from places like Russia, Latin America, and the Middle East. Their languages are hard to learn perfectly, making it tough for them to be understood in English.

Some people in the USA use other cultures' language and ideas without giving credit. They ignore the history and keep stereotypes about immigrants. Immigrants' languages often get criticized, leading to discrimination. People link the language immigrants speak with their education and intelligence, not their background.

Things are getting better though, mostly because of creativity. Many famous musicians in the USA are immigrants. They succeed by changing how they talk or sing, not just by using bad words. This shows that it's okay to talk differently, no matter where you are from.

The relationship between Americans and immigrants shows up in how they talk. Even if your English isn't perfect, people will try to understand you, not just in the USA but all over the world. Don't be afraid to talk or write in English, even online. Understanding this is important for language freedom in the USA.
