The tale of King Uruk, also known as Gilgamesh, is very famous for telling how people and gods are connected. Basically, The Epic of Gilgamesh is the first story about gods and humans. Specifically, this story talks mostly about how King Uruk changes from being a bad ruler to a good one when he learns about death. 
In this story, the main person is the King of Uruk, who shows us that in old times, people felt like us. According to Anneberg Learner (2021), this writing is older than the Bible, being “four thousand years old at least.” So, The Epic of Gilgamesh talks about the life of Uruk’s leader, who was very special, being “two-thirds god and one-third human” (Anneberg Learner, 2021). But when the gods saw that Gilgamesh was too proud, they sent his friend Enkidu. Finally, the King of Uruk understood how important it is to have friends, saying it was “great to be close to another person” (Anneberg Learner, 2021). It is important to mention that Enkidu started like Adam and then became more like a normal person with the help of a woman sent by the gods. However, a mistake made by Enkidu and Gilgamesh led to Enkidu’s death, making Gilgamesh look for a way to live forever. 
Overall, the story says that only gods can live forever, while humans will always die. In the end, Gilgamesh loses his chance to live forever because of a snake, but he finds value in his city and his memories. At the end of the story, the city lives on even after its ruler is gone, showing why people remember this story for so long.
