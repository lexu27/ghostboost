For the politics and laws to work well, all parts must match. U.S. states have some freedom and their own rules, but they must not go against the main U.S. rules, which also have the first ten changes - the Bill of Rights. One set says what each power branch should do and the other says the basic rights people have. If the state rules go against the main ones, it might mean there is not enough togetherness and fairness in the country. This essay looks at Article I of the Florida rules, to see if they match the U.S. rules, in particular, the Bill of Rights.

Each part of the Florida rules talks about different legal things. Part I talks about the rights that all people in Florida have and is divided into 27 parts. This study will focus on three: religious freedom, rights of the accused and crime victims, and the right to privacy. Each of them is in its own part of Article I.

Religious freedom is a big right that helps democracy. It is in Section 3 of Article I in the Florida rules, which says no law should make people follow a religion or stop them from practicing freely. It is similar to Amendment I of the Bill of Rights. The Florida rules also say “religious freedom should not support actions that go against public morals, peace, or safety.” So, in terms of religious freedom, the Florida rules match the Bill of Rights and add an important note.

The rights of the accused and crime victims talk about the rights of people involved in criminal cases. They are listed in Section 16 of Article I. First, it says the accused must know what they are accused of, have the right to bring witnesses, face those against them, and have a fast, public, and fair trial. This matches Amendment VI of the U.S. rules. Section 16 was changed recently to stress and make sure victims have rights too. Now, it makes sure victims are safe, private, respected, and protected from the accused and all kinds of harm. Surprisingly, the U.S. rules do not talk about this.

Another important right for democracy is the right to privacy. It is in Section 23 of the Florida rules, which gives all people the right to be left alone and free from the government getting into their private life, unless stated otherwise. This right was added to the Florida rules in 1980. It was used to help the Death with Dignity Act, which supports assisted suicide. The U.S. rules do not have this part, and other states may have different laws about it.

To end, the Florida rules mostly match the U.S. rules and the Bill of Rights, showing that the state and all Americans believe in the same basic democratic values. They cover religious freedom and the rights of the accused during a criminal case. However, like other state rules, they have more rights and rules just for their people. For example, they have a long list of rights for crime victims and a clear right to privacy, not in the U.S. rules.
