The job to make things safe during bad times is called emergency management. Doing practice, making pretend situations, checking tools, and working together in a crisis are very important for getting ready for emergencies. Fires in forests, shaking ground, big winds, accidents, explosions, dangerous chemicals, heavy snow, and lots of water are some bad things that emergency management helps with. Making things better before, during, and after bad things happen is what emergency management does. 

To be fast in a crisis, planning, leading, working together, training, getting ready, checking, fixing, and doing better are all part of getting ready. When something bad happens, getting all the help needed and planning for people who help first is important. Knowing what is needed and how to use it well is key here. After something bad, fixing the place and helping people get better is the aim.

Help for a town in New Hampshire after a big fire was the first time the government gave money to help after a local disaster. Laws were made in 1803 to help with this. In the 1930s, the government gave money to fix things like roads and buildings after disasters. The TVA came to make electricity and stop floods. Laws were made so the Army could help with floods all over the country. These things helped start more programs to manage emergencies in the United States.

Difference Between Emergency Management and Civil Defense
Civil defense is about keeping people safe and fixing things after a bad attack. It helps protect people from natural disasters. It uses plans to stop bad things, get ready, react, move people, and bring them back safely. Protecting people from natural disasters is called disaster defense.

Emergency management is about keeping people, places, and governments safe from any danger. Plans to stay safe started back in the 1920s when war and bombings were big worries. Later on, when nuclear weapons were scary, plans changed to cover all kinds of threats. Now, the focus is on helping after big disasters and keeping everyone safe. New terms like crisis help, stopping disasters, getting ready, recovery plans, helping people, and public safety are used now.
