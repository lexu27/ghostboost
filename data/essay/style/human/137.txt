Throughout the journey, Odysseus meets many different people who have their own stories and ways to talk to Odysseus. The stories of these people and how they are important to Odysseus are very needed to understand the poem. In the big poem The Odyssey by Homer, Odysseus meets Athena, Poseidon, and Polyphemus. They all have their own stories and are important in Odysseus’ journey.
Athena and Poseidon are gods, but Polyphemus is a Cyclops that Odysseus meets. Athena and Poseidon have special powers because they are gods, but Polyphemus is known for being a leader and the son of Poseidon. Odysseus first sees Athena as a girl, but Poseidon gets angry at Odysseus for hurting Polyphemus.
Even though Odysseus meets many gods, Athena is very important because she protects Odysseus on his journey. When Odysseus talks to Athena, he asks her for help and says he can fight a lot of men with her help.
Another god Odysseus meets is Poseidon, who is the god of the seas. Poseidon is very angry at Odysseus for hurting his son and tries to make Odysseus’ journey hard.
Polyphemus tries to hurt Odysseus, but Odysseus tricks him instead. Polyphemus can’t get help because Odysseus tricks him, showing how smart Odysseus is.
