Confusion about Art Deco and Depression styles is very common even among smart people who don't see the big differences in the art ways. Art Deco is a French style that comes from Lalique, Art Noveau, and Picasso's works. On the other hand, Depression style shows the problems of sad feelings of workers and wants them to feel better through art. Even though sometimes people mix these art ways, they are quite different and mean different things to society.
To explain more, these styles are different in their main parts like materials, colors, and shapes. Art Deco is more exciting with bright colors and pretty decorations like triangles, zigzags, and trapezoids. This way is strong and catches your eye because the art is a bit messy with many different ideas and influences, but still very impressive. Also, Art Deco uses materials that are made by people for sculptures and buildings, like you can see in Radio City Music Hall at Rockefeller Center.
In contrast, Depression art is about sad or gloomy feelings, like you can see in the design of Hotel Ambassador in Bucharest. Also, this art is simple and not as exciting as Art Deco because it doesn't have lots of colors or shapes. Actually, the person who started Depression style, Raymond Loewy, says that the style is in the middle between not too much and too many details. In short, Art Deco and Depression are different in how they look and what they mean because they tell different things to the people who see them.
