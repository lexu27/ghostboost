The life in South Sudan really thinks bulls are important; they use them in many services and kill them to feed the whole family. Grey Bull is a movie that shows how important bulls are to the people in South Sudan. Grey Bull, made by Eddie Bell, is a short 15-minute movie about the fight between Martin, a man from South Sudan, and the owner of the cow slaughterhouse.

Bell's story goes back to the 1800s when a new person arrived in Australia and wanted to be in history books. "I wanted to make a new story like Ned Kelly," the director said in an interview.

Grey Bull has good ideas, but it's the story and the acting that really catch people's attention. It's easy to see why director Bell got praise for this movie. When immigration is a big topic worldwide, it's nice to see a story about a migrant that shows a positive side of the journey.

A story about leaving your past to focus on the future. Grey Bull makes you think like the main character and asks important questions about moving to a new place.

The movie doesn't have heroes or big plots, it's just about a man's struggles. But the simple visuals and themes make it interesting to watch again. The scenes are well shot and make the story clear.

The colors in the movie are nice and pleasing to the eye; each frame looks good without any special effects needed. Apart from the camera work, Grey Bull has a feeling that affects the audience's emotions.

The weather and lighting play a big role in each scene, making the calm movie more intense. But this adds to the excitement of the movie. The story deals with conflicts in a real way.

The movie tells a simple story and leaves room for interpretation. The ending makes you think and discuss the movie for a long time.

Overall, Grey Bull gets a strong 9/10, almost perfect. It's a movie for everyone to watch and think about. I recommend watching it and giving it some thought. Grey Bull is a unique movie that captures the minds and emotions of the audience, leaving them to think and come up with their own ideas.
