Introduction
There are many ways to find mental health problems. The Rorschach test is a popular test used in many countries. Many people know about this test from movies and TV. Some think it is good for finding mental problems, but others disagree.

Nowadays, the test involves looking at 10 cards and talking about them. The cards are black and white, and some are colored. Scientists have argued about how to understand the results of the test for a long time. There are different tools to help with this, like the RPAS and CS systems. Even though some don't like this test, it is still a good way to find issues like schizophrenia.

History
Rorschach was not the first to use pictures to find mental problems. He got the idea from a game called Blotto. When schizophrenia became a big problem, Rorschach looked at art made by mental patients. He made 15 cards to test people's mental health. After testing with 400 patients, a book was published. Sadly, Rorschach died soon after.

Uses
To use the test, each person looks at 10 cards one by one. They can hold the cards in any way they want. They can say a few words or many words about the pictures. The person giving the test can ask more questions if needed.

Assessment
The results are studied in two steps, looking at how people describe the pictures and then understanding what it means. If someone talks about the pictures in a strange way, it might show a problem. The time taken to answer the questions is also important.

Criticisms
Some people think one system to understand the test is too hard and makes mistakes. A new system called R-PAS is better. This system is used in many countries and is more reliable.

Conclusion
The Rorschach test is important for finding mental issues. Even though it is old, it is still useful. People are working to make it better in the future.
