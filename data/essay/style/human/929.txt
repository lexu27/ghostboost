Creationism is a belief about how the world was made from the Bible. Some think it is like science, but it does not follow science rules. Scientists need proof, not just faith. Creationists don't mind this. I want to talk about one article that tries to disprove evolution and says life was made by smart beings. I will show why this is wrong using science. The article's first mistake is saying humans never changed into other creatures. This is not true because things were different long ago. The author forgets that changes take a long time. Humans changed slowly, like how our bodies are different now. The second mistake is saying simple life forms can't become complex ones. But we see this happening without any help. The last mistake is saying there are no fossils showing evolution. Evolution happens fast when there is a need to change. This is why we don't see many in-between forms in fossils. In the end, creationist arguments have many problems. They need to look at other scientific views to make their ideas better.
