Ethics is very important in the justice system. It helps decide what is a crime and the right punishment. Judges, juries, police, and lawyers use ethics to make good choices. Following ethics means treating everyone fairly and protecting their rights. This essay talks about public corruption from different points of view.

Public corruption is when a person in power misuses it for personal gain. Some thinkers like Immanuel Kant and John Rawls say that being good means having goodwill and following important rules. Public corruption happens when people break the rules everyone should follow.

Public corruption can happen because of one person, a group, or society. For example, some say that a bad police officer is like a bad apple, not like the whole bunch. People who work in corrupt places might not know how to make good choices because of their work environment.

In the movie Leon: The Professional, corrupt police officers cause trouble for a girl named Mathilda. They wanted to profit from selling drugs that Mathilda's father knew about. This shows how individual corruption can hurt others.

Organizational corruption happens when a group's culture doesn't follow ethics. Sometimes, mistrust and lack of teamwork can lead to corruption. In The Green Mile, prison workers help a sick boss by breaking the rules. They did this because they cared for each other, even if it was wrong.

Society can also cause corruption by not punishing bad behavior. People might ignore crimes if it benefits them. The documentary The Seven Five shows how society's tolerance for crime can lead to corruption.

To stop corruption, we need to pay officials better, train them well, and have good leaders. We also need to work together to change society's views on corruption. It won't be easy, but it's important to teach people to make good choices and not take bribes.
