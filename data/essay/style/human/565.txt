The study says that making it illegal for ladies who are having a baby and use drugs is not good for them or the baby. It talks about how punishing moms-to-be for using drugs instead of giving them good therapy or care can be bad (Thomas et al., 2018). The results suggest that making it a crime for pregnant ladies to use drugs is not a good idea and can lead to bad health for both moms and babies (Weber et al., 2021). Also, the rules are often unfair, and methods to reduce harm make sure that pregnant ladies get the help they need.

This is why making it against the law for pregnant ladies to use drugs is not good for moms and babies. Moms-to-be who use drugs might be very scared of getting caught, put in jail, or locked up if they try to get prenatal care or help for their drug problem. Also, making a lady's actions during pregnancy a crime goes against her basic rights, especially her right to keep things private and be treated fairly under the law (Carroll et al., 2021). It says it takes away a woman's freedom to have kids and keep her body safe. It punishes ladies who want to continue their pregnancy and makes them think about not getting in trouble by ending their pregnancy. So, it's important to remember that some rules may support ending a pregnancy (Carroll et al., 2021). Also, it treats women unfairly in general because it doesn't punish dads who do things that could hurt an unborn child.
