The Coptic religious group has been in Egypt for a very long time. The troubles started when Egypt was taken over by the Arabs and they still continue now. Coptic Christians are often picked on, sometimes leading to scary events or deaths. In normal life, Coptic Christians face opposition from the people in Egypt, regular Muslims (Sherwood, 2018). On a spiritual and big level, Copts are in danger from bad groups like ISIS. They were made to leave Iraq and Syria and went to Egypt secretly. 
The problems for Copts are all over Egypt, showing that their religion is mentioned on Egyptians' IDs. This lets Muslim Egyptians say no to Copts for jobs, making it hard for their small businesses to grow. In daily life, Copts say they are treated badly in hospitals, schools, and colleges (Sherwood, 2018). Bad groups often grab Coptic women and make them marry Muslims (Sherwood, 2018). This kind of marriage means a Muslim doesn't want to marry a non-Muslim woman. Before they marry, a Christian woman must change to her husband's religion. Apart from kidnappings, extreme Muslims hurt church leaders and blow up cars and buildings where Copts might be. 
The text doesn't talk about help from nearby countries or others who want to help Coptic Christians. Even so, Copts have a big community made up of Catholics, Orthodox Christians, and other groups (Sherwood, 2018). People might think countries don't get involved in the problem because bad groups like ISIS are already in it. After many people in the world were hurt by bad groups, no government wants to get involved. Another reason for the lack of help is the long history of the problem. The history of the war explains why it started, and many outsiders see the mistreatment of the Copts as something that makes sense.
