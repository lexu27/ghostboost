Counseling for people with HIV/AIDS has many feelings problems. One big worry is how they feel when they know about it. Some people may feel very calm, but others can feel upset, angry, or worried for a long time. So, the main advice for people who help those with HIV/AIDS is to give time for the news to be understood. After being shocked, people might need to share their feelings, which can be very stressful. So, the important advice for counselors is to stay calm and let the person take their time instead of acting quickly.

Another tip is to focus on ways to cope better. The counselor should help the person plan their care and get support from others. It's also important to work with the person's partner, friends, and family to get the best results. The therapist should know they can't always be there, but the person's loved ones can step in when needed most. This will help the person keep living normally. It's important to help the person see past all the wrong ideas about the disease and know that life keeps going after the news. These ways can help the person feel better emotionally.
