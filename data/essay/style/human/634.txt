The play shows lies when Abigail tells other girls to not say the truth about what they did in the forest. The people in the village accuse each other of doing witchcraft which makes them hate each other. Abigail and her friend Tituba blame villagers for working with the devil. Not having enough information causes unfairness for the accusers. It is important to get information from different people to show who is lying.
