The video "Eye of the Storm" is very interesting. It shows how people can think differently about race in school. Jane Elliott made some kids with blue eyes and other kids with brown eyes. She told the kids with brown eyes that they were better. This doesn't really mean anything. It just shows how much dark skin color they have. But the kids thought it was important. So, Elliott made race a big deal by saying one group was better. She used eye colors to show who belonged to which group.

The kids started acting differently because of this. The kids with brown eyes felt more sure of themselves and started acting like they were better than the kids with blue eyes. On the other hand, the blue-eyed kids became more shy and quiet. They felt scared because of the other group. Their grades went down, and they didn't get along with the brown-eyed kids anymore. By the end, it was clear that there was a big difference between the two groups. They would fight a lot. Both groups were affected in a bad way because of this new race thing.

What I found most interesting was how quickly the kids changed their behavior. They were friends before, but as soon as they were split into groups, they stopped being friends. They learned the new rules very fast. This shows that kids can easily learn and follow new rules. Teachers and adults need to be very careful when teaching kids. Bad things can happen if kids learn the wrong things.
