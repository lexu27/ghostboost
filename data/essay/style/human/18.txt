In his picture book, Spiegelman uses a fancy tool called anthropomorphism to show the differences between different groups like Americans, Germans, and Jews. This tool makes the big problem seem easier to understand, so readers pay more attention to the ideas from the writer. In Maus, Spiegelman shows the bad things that happened during the holocaust and reminds readers that the people in the holocaust had their own lives and dreams too.

The first part we talk about is Chapter 1 - "The Sheik." Here, the main person Artie asks his dad Vladek to tell him about his life during the war. Instead of talking about the bad things Vladek saw during the holocaust, he likes to talk to his son about his happy times in 1935 (Spiegelman, 1980, pp. 13-23). This shows that the people from the war like to remember the good times.

The second part is Chapter 3 - "Prisoner of War." Here, Vladek talks about the first things he saw as a soldier. It's interesting that Vladek remembers the name of a soldier he killed, and this shows that even during bad times, people remember small things (Spiegelman, 1980, p. 50). Finally, Vladek says that meeting his family again was more important than what happened to him as a prisoner of war.

The third part to talk about is Chapter 5 - "Mouse Holes." This part shows that for many mice, war means making hard choices to try to survive (Spiegelman, 1980). Even when parents hear about their children dying, they have to stay calm to avoid the cats.

In the end, we can say that this picture book is a special story about World War II. In these comics, Spiegelman shows the bad things from the holocaust and the small but important things that gave hope to some people. Even though the war was full of violence, the author shows that the Germans are like animals who think they are better than others.
