The early rock music was finished because of two things. Firstly, in the late 1950s, rock and roll lost some important people. Little Richard stopped music and became a priest, Elvis Presley went to the army, and Chuck Berry got in trouble with the law (Covach and Flory 105). Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valence, and the Big Bopper had a bad accident and died on February 3, 1959. Many famous artists gone made the rock and roll not strong anymore.

Also, people liked rock and roll a lot, and this made big music companies worried. Before 1950, big companies made the most famous pop songs (Covach and Flory 106). But then, rock and roll stars started making songs with small companies and paid the radio DJs to play them. This made some people angry. The big companies did not like that rock and roll took their place. Then, there was a problem with money in the music business. Alan Freed, a DJ who helped rock and roll, lost his job because he took gifts.

So, the rock music changed a lot in the 1960s. People who stopped the first rock music saw that young people and rock could make money. They made the music clean and safe, and they only showed artists who were not too different (Kot). Big companies made music for young people, and no big names came until the Beatles and the British Invasion.
