In Mesopotamia and Egypt, first kings worked with priests and needed their help. But Egyptian kings, called pharaohs, were seen as kings of the whole area and were higher than priests, while Mesopotamian kings worked closely with them. Another big difference is where the rulers came from, as Mesopotamian kings were also fighters who led their people in fights with others, while Egyptian pharaohs were believed to be god-kings. Egypt was one unit, unlike Mesopotamia, which showed itself as many states.

Also, they had different ideas about gods making people. Mesopotamians thought gods were mean and believed people were not meant to have fun and could make gods angry. Unlike Egyptians, they didn't believe in life after death, maybe because gods didn't like people. In Egypt, each person followed a religious and moral code approved by gods. This is why life after death was so important in their beliefs - it was a way to judge how good they were in life.

Religion and farming growth led to the progress of the countries. The Middle Kingdom of Egypt is famous for using papyrus, ink, and makeup. Mummification was a key part of their religious beliefs. In contrast, Mesopotamia focused on war and trade, which led them to invent the wheel and improve their buildings and sciences. It's possible that religion played a big role in Egypt's important inventions. Overall, the main differences between the regions came from their different religious and political systems.
