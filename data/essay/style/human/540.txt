Plato wrote Gorgias. It is a talk between Socrates and smart people. They talk about good behavior and talking well. Gorgias says, “A good talker can win any fight with words, and make people believe anything” (Dodds, 1990). He thinks talking well is for making ideas sound good.

Socrates says that talkers in Athens want to win, not tell the truth. He says, "A talker doesn't need to know the truth; he just needs to look smart to the not-smart people" (Dodds, 1990). He doesn't like this because talking well can be learned and used by anyone, even if they know nothing.

In the book "Thank You for Smoking," Nick Naylor is a talker for a tobacco company. He can win any talk with his clever words. For instance, in Congress, he asked, "Who thinks cigarettes are safe?" even though he knows they are not and no one talks in Congress (Buckley 2010). He uses three ways to talk well: Ethos for being trusted; Logos for making sense, and Pathos for feelings. So, even if what he says is not true, people will probably believe him after he talks.
