When heart stops pump blood, person fall asleep and no blood or air come out. If not help fast, person can die. In Australia, many people die each year from heart stoppage. Most people who have heart stoppage die because of it. Heart stoppage can happen to anyone, not only old or sick people. Important to help fast with CPR and defibrillation to save life and keep brain working. 

To save someone, need to do CPR right and work together with medical team. Nurse in video show how to do CPR and use defibrillator. First, nurse see patient not moving on bed, so nurse call for help. If patient not respond to touch or talk, nurse need help from others. Australian guideline say team should help in heart stoppage. 

Before start CPR, need to check patient's airway to see if need CPR. Clear airway by opening mouth and lower head to let things out. Use fingers to remove stuff from mouth carefully. If airway blocked during CPR, turn patient on side. After clear airway, check if patient breathing normally. Nurse in video listen for air in nose and mouth to see if breathing. 

During CPR, can give breaths in different ways. Nurse in video use bag mask for breaths. Bag mask help give oxygen to patient. Need to give breaths properly to avoid stomach problem. Two people should do CPR together, one hold mask and other squeeze bag. Bag mask should have oxygen to give good oxygen to patient. 

Compress chest important in CPR. Video show compressions at right speed and depth. Do 30 compressions then two breaths every two minutes. If compressions not deep enough, survival chances lower. Need to switch people doing compressions every two minutes to avoid tiredness. 

Defibrillation important with CPR. Use AED on people not breathing and unconscious. Timing of shock important for survival. Place pads correctly on chest for shock to work. Leader in team guide others when to shock. 

When heart stop, help with CPR and defibrillation to save life. Teamwork and right actions can save life during heart stoppage. Check airway, do CPR correctly, and use AED to help person survive.
