When teaching students who need special help with language, like those who speak two languages (DLLs), it's important to talk in a way that makes them want to join in conversations. DLLs are really good at switching between different rules while doing tasks (Sandhofer & Uchikoshi, 2013). So, to help kids talk more and use language better, I can plan activities and games in class where we switch languages quickly, translate ideas from pictures into another language, and more.

Another way to make sure teachers don't talk too much is to not give too many hints or ask too many leading questions during class discussions. Encouraging DLLs to ask and answer questions while reading helps them get better at speaking (Halgunseth et al., 2013). But, to make sure kids want to join in and share their thoughts, I can pay attention to how I ask questions and use gestures instead of unnecessary words. For example, instead of giving the answer when kids don't know, I can use gestures and clues to help them think and talk in groups. This will make them more likely to talk and practice speaking out loud.
