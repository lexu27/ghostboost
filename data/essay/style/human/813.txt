The country I talk about is Mexico, as shown by its famous citizen - Mexican poet and writer Octavio Paz. He talks about Mexican life and culture in his important essay The Labyrinth of Solitude. This review will focus on Chapter 3 of the essay about parties in general and the Day of the Dead in particular, which show the national traits of Mexicans.

Parties or celebrations are very important for Mexicans. Paz (1961) says their "calendar is full of parties" (p.47). Some may say every culture has celebrations, so Mexicans having them is not special. But Paz sees some differences in how his fellow Mexicans celebrate and see their parties compared to people from other countries. The author also talks about why Mexicans love big celebrations and parties.

Life experiences can affect artists' works, and Paz is no different. His family suffered a lot during the Mexican Civil War and was poor. However, Paz had access to his grandfather's big library where he learned a lot and later got an education and started publishing his poems. What's important is that Paz traveled and worked in different countries like Spain, France, and the US. This helped him see his country from inside as a citizen and from outside as someone who met foreigners and learned about different ways of life. You understand your culture better when you see others. That's why Paz's view on Mexican culture is so precise.

In Chapter 3 of The Labyrinth of Solitude, Paz talks about why Mexicans love big celebrations and parties. He also explains some paradoxes about how Mexicans view holidays that confuse foreigners. For example, why Mexico spends so much money on what seems like useless celebrations. Another paradox is how Mexicans celebrate the Day of the Dead so cheerfully.

Paz explains the importance of the present moment in Mexican parties. During parties, time stops and becomes the present, where past and future meet. Parties let Mexicans enjoy what they have now instead of worrying about the future. It may sound impractical, as one should still plan for the future, but it's important to enjoy the present too.

Another thing Paz mentions is that parties might help Mexicans avoid loneliness. Mexican celebrations always have many people. In places like Paris or New York, gatherings may be big too, but there is something special about Mexican parties forming a community. This way, no one feels lonely.

Mexican parties are noisy and energetic, showing Mexicans' need to release their emotions. Everything is amplified during parties, with people singing, shooting fireworks, and even firing guns. By doing this, Mexicans feel like their souls are free. Although violent actions during parties are not good, how Mexicans release their feelings is interesting.

Foreigners are surprised by how much money Mexicans spend on parties and the festive atmosphere during death-related rituals. Paz explains that both these cultural practices attract their opposites. So, for Mexicans, spending money attracts more money, and celebrating death brings new life.

Mexican parties are chaotic, but Mexicans like this chaos. It helps them escape social rules and be free. They can forget their identities and be someone else. As hierarchies disappear during parties, everyone is equal and free. This way, people from different social levels can feel closer.

In summary, Octavio Paz's The Labyrinth of Solitude shows us a bit about Mexican culture and beliefs. Mexicans' views on parties teach us to enjoy the present, value companionship, and express emotions freely. Mexicans see a magical link between opposite life events and use it in their rituals: spending money to attract more and celebrating death to start anew. Parties can be seen as a small rebellion against rules: participants lose their statuses but feel equal and connected, which is hard to find in other situations.
