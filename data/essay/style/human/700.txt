The people we looked at were Americans from all 50 states and the District of Columbia who are 18 years old or older. There were around 1038 random American people who can vote and help make laws. So, any American who can vote and lives in the USA is who we are studying.

We picked the group randomly. The researchers chose some phone numbers from the list for landlines. They also picked cellphone numbers using a random-digit-dial method. People in a house were chosen based on their birthday, and the person with the latest birthday was the one who took part.

Each group had at least 400 people with cellphones and 600 with landlines out of every 1000 adults. The researchers talked to a total of 1038 adults in the USA.

They called the subjects on landlines and cellphones. Since the people were picked randomly, some interviews were done in Spanish for those who speak Spanish.

The study happened in December 2012. The researchers talked on the phone with American citizens from December 19 to December 22. They looked at the data and official reports from 2011 after the interviews.

The study looked at the differences in the results because of mistakes in the questions and other challenges in surveys. These things can lead to errors or wrong results in opinion polls.

My guess about the error margin is backed up in section f. In this test, we will see if taking ant venom pills for a week can reduce swelling in people with arthritis.
