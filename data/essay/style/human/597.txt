The 13th Change in the U.S. Lawbook came in the second part of the 1800s, making slavery go away in all the land. As per the words, everyone in the U.S. cannot make people be slaves or be slaves themselves by other U.S. folks, no matter if they are a man or woman, of any race, young or old (U.S. Const. change 13, ยง 1). Stopping slavery in the state has affected U.S. history and the lives of all Americans, starting the return of personal freedom and nation-wide choice. Now, this Change doesn't have a big effect on the daily life of Americans, but its words limit human freedom in a way. It says that forced work is stopped except for when punishing criminals, and the lack of more talk about this saying now brings about lots of people from different races being put in jail a lot in the U.S.

The 15th Change in the U.S. Lawbook gives the right to vote to every American, no matter their race (U.S. Const. change 15, ยง 1). Made official back in 1870, this Change started a country-wide move toward fairness and the end of racism in the laws. Today, about 15% of people in the U.S. are Black, and making sure they can vote changes the daily life of all Americans, because 15% of 300 million Americans means enough votes to fully change a country's politics. Also, the 15th Change has helped to get rid of racism not just in the laws but in how people relate to each other.
