The Metamorphosis by Franz Kafka is a big story about a young man who changes into a bug and gets stuck in his room because of apples thrown at him. Georg Samka wakes up in a strange dream world and nobody is nice to him, even though he gave up his dreams so his sister could study music. His family's reactions and how they act towards him show their true feelings.

Gregor’s family used to be kind to him, but after he turned into a bug, they became mean. They were okay with him before because he worked and supported them. They didn't have a strong bond, but they respected him. When they thought he might be late for work, they checked on him. His dad tried to wake him up even if he wasn’t working, but he sounded serious.

His sister, Grete, was the only one who helped him, asking if he was sick and trying to make him feel better. She brought him food he might like, like old veggies and cheese. His mom was sad about his change and tried to help, but she couldn't look at him. His dad was not nice and got angry because Gregor couldn't work anymore.

After the change, his family mistreated him. His dad hurt him with fruit, making him sick. Since Gregor couldn't work, his family got jobs to help. Grete also stopped caring for him and wanted him to leave. Gregor realized it was best for him to die.

In the end, Gregor's transformation shows how his family really felt about him. He wanted to be free from his duties, his job, and his family's dependence on him. His change revealed his anger towards his family for using him and not helping with money.
