The project rules are very important for every company because they help people work together better and reach goals. So, the good plan is to make a map for the project. This means setting goals along the way and one big goal in the end (Kerzner, 2017). The rules should make teamwork better, help team members talk, and make sure everyone works well together to get good results. The first rule is really important because teams need to work together well for the company to grow. People should get tools to make great teams and talk and decide together. For example, Basecamp is a good app to help workers talk about their tasks and share things (Biafore, 2020). Putting them in groups will make tasks shared well and meet the goals. Also, teamwork can be organized by making clear lists of what needs to be done and showing them to teams. Giving them info about goals and tasks will make them know more and share jobs better, which is important for meeting new rules and good results. So, the plan says we need to make teamwork better and follow rules like working together and helping each other using tools like Basecamp. This way, people can talk about their work, share info about goals, and make teams based on what's needed (Kerzner, 2017). If we follow this plan, we can get better at work and help the company reach new goals.
