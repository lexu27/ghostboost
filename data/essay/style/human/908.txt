Several ways are used to compare how intervention works in different jobs. Ways to do this include interest-based methods, generalist intervention model in social work, and traditional adversarial model in law. This paper will talk a lot about the change of roles in these jobs, like skills and strategies, when moving from one job to another when there is a conflict between different people.

Three jobs are looked at - mediation, social work, and law. To show this, I use an interest-based model for mediation, a generalist model for social work, and a traditional adversarial law model. It’s important to note that some laws and social work people might see mediation as a role they could do. There are big differences in how these three models work, their values, and techniques, as said by Barsky in 2017. A lawyer is usually someone who fights for one side in a fight. Social workers often fight for specific clients or causes. But if they want to be a mediator, they need to be neutral. Clients can use mediators to talk for them.

Mediators help both sides talk, they don’t take any sides. It’s hard for people used to fighting for someone to be neutral. All three jobs think customers should make their own decisions based on their values. They value individualism and self-worth. Some think the law takes away people's right to decide. Disputes are usually best fixed by talking, not going to court. Only when talks can't work, do people go to court.

For example, if there’s a fight between an employer and employee, using the interest-based method in mediation, as a mediator, I listen to both sides. I listen to both sides to stay neutral, as a mediator, I carefully look at the problem and make sure they understand it and can't agree.

So, if that doesn't work, I’d use the generalist intervention model in social work, where both sides work together to solve the problem. If that fails, I’d use the traditional adversarial law model where each side has someone to speak for them in court if they can't agree. The lawyer has to listen to their client and act accordingly. Overall, the goal of intervention is to help the parties with the problem to have a better relationship.
