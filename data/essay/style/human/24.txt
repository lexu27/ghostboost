An Information Systems Report explains that stakeholders are people who care about how well the business is doing. In this case, stakeholders include the people who invested their money in the business, the managers who make decisions, and the workers who help the business run smoothly. Vendors are also important as they provide goods and services to customers. Lastly, lenders give money to people or businesses expecting to get it back with some extra money.

In this story, the boss tells Zoe, who manages the money records, to make the company look like it's making more money than it actually is.
