The lady, G. B., is 50 years old and has a sickness called COPD. She came to the clinic with lots of coughing, feeling like she can't breathe, tiredness, and too much spit. She said she smoked for 20 years and sometimes her heart beats a bit fast. She has high blood pressure but takes Lisinopril for it. She doesn't like hospitals and thinks she doesn't need medicine all the time. She is alone because her husband passed away, and her kids live in another country. She doesn't want to bother them but wants to check her health alone. She feels lonely since her husband died. She has some friends who visit her, but she doesn't have one person to talk to regularly about her problems.
Sickness Explanation
COPD is a common problem for adults who smoke. It's a big reason why many people get sick or die today. That's why it's important to teach people about it early and take care of it. People with COPD cough a lot, feel tired, and their life isn't as good. When people smoke, they might have trouble breathing and doctors check how much air they can breathe in and out. When the lungs get infected, they swell and make it hard to breathe. If it's not treated, the airways can get blocked, making it painful to breathe.
With time, people with COPD get new problems like swelling and noisy breathing. They don't want to eat, feel tired, and dizzy. Older people with COPD might also get heart issues, pneumonia, or other bad infections. So, it's important for people who smoke to take care of themselves.
Check-Up
When G. B. came to the clinic, a doctor asked her questions to know more about her sickness. They checked how bad her symptoms were and how long she had them. They also checked her blood pressure, pulse, breathing, weight, and oxygen levels. Her head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat looked normal, but her mouth and throat were wet. The doctor listened to her heart and lungs and heard some sounds. They ordered a chest X-ray to see if she has problems like emphysema. They also did a test to check her breathing. Her result showed that her COPD was moderate, and it could get worse if not treated.
G. B. was worried about her health and didn't have anyone to talk to. She didn't know much about COPD risks for smokers. The doctor told her to join a group for people with lung problems. They also taught her how to relax and breathe better. She learned to change her lifestyle, rest more, and get help at home. She got antibiotics to stop infections. After the treatment, she felt better. Her breathing was not as bad, no infections were found, and she thought about joining a support group. She needs to keep learning about COPD and quit smoking to avoid more lung and heart problems in the future.
