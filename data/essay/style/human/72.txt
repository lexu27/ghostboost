In Liu and Asimov’s short stories, they talk about people and robots. Liu Ken, who wrote The Algorithms for Love, says people are too young to know everything about the world. People seem to want to do things on their own. Asimov’s Liar is special because it looks at how technology and morals clash in today’s world. Liu and Asimov talk about robots and people in different ways, but they think robots and people think alike.

Liu Ken asks where the line is between robot and human minds. He wonders if a robot that learns can be like a person. After all, both robots and people make decisions based on what they know. Ken also asks if people are like robots with artificial minds. Ken makes readers think about who made people act this way.

Ken’s story is about Elena, who makes robots for a toy company. She creates a smart robot that can talk like a person. But Elena knows the robot is smart because of how she programmed it. She worries that people might just be following a program too. Ken Liu mixes science fiction with human feelings in his story, making readers think about what makes us human.

Among Asimov’s works, I, Robot stands out. This book shows Asimov’s thoughts on society and philosophy. In the story Liar, a robot named Herbie talks about how he cares more about people’s emotions than science. Asimov likes discussing society and feelings in his stories.

Both authors have similar themes in their stories, even though they focus on different things. Asimov thinks the best robot is one that acts like a person. Liu warns about what might happen if we treat robots like people. They both try to explain what it means to be human and the good and bad parts of being human.
