Studying old stories can help us know how people thought about society long ago. This essay looks at a book by Franz Kafka called "Metamorphoses." The paper says this book is still important today in different ways. The main point is about how lonely people feel, even when they want a happy life.

Before we talk about why this book is important today, we need to know what it is about. "Metamorphoses" tells us about a man called Gregor Samsa who turns into a big bug one day. The story is about how he tries to live like this. His family puts him in a room and feeds him, but he dies later.

This book can be related to today’s world easily. Studies show that it doesn’t just talk about people’s thoughts, but looks at their problems inside (Balaban 235). One big problem is how lonely people feel. Even though the main character had a family, he was alone in the end. The story shows a happy family walking together, but we can’t see they lost someone. Today, people also feel lonely, especially because of new technology. They stay in their own worlds and stop talking to others.

To end, we should remember that Franz Kafka wrote this book in a time called modernism. It was a time when people challenged old rules. So, in "The Metamorphosis," Kafka talks about the lack of love and how lonely people can be, which is still true today. Many people hide their feelings of loneliness, even if it’s hard to see at first.
