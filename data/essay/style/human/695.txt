Considering free will means no punishment, free will justifies some punishments. Free will is important for marking someone guilty and giving punishment. Those who say no to free will are not responsible for crimes. Free will means personalizing actions, affecting decisions. The policeman's choice to lock up violent people is right to keep everyone safe. But not everyone agrees on free will and responsibility.

Causal indeterminism says actions are not caused by anything. Some say actions can be caused by things that are not predictable. The problem with this theory is that luck can explain actions. If past events cause actions, people are not responsible. Some people use this to justify their actions and avoid blame.

Talking about free will means talking about the soul. The soul is responsible for actions since there are reasons for them. Defining the soul is harder than defining matter. The soul is believed to be the mind of the body, responsible for it.
