Any change in how people hang out together can affect how people do bad things. Because of Covid-19, in some places in America, the stealing from shops has gone down by 75 percent. However, because of the virus, there are more bad things happening related to the Coronavirus (Deloitte, 2020). Many bad things happening have moved around, and as technology gets better, some bad things in the future will involve watching people. The police will have a hard time following the rules and keeping secrets when they use cars that the police need to use (Fortenbery, 2016). The police will have to control watching people when they collect information and move things around. Another bad thing to think about is testing someone's DNA (Fortenbery, 2016). Technology getting better has put together different ways to read DNA all at once (MPS). With this way, the ability to read DNA has gotten better and faster, and bad people might try to mess with samples using different types of evidence and ways (Fortenbery, 2016). As DNA gets better and more samples are known, the police will have harder times with analyzing bad things in the future.

One phone app that helps police talk to people is SceneDoc, which lets police write down things, see people's files, give tickets, and finish reports. This app makes things quicker and more exact, gives more information, and makes police safer when they are out (inTime, n.d.). The other important police phone app is USCop, which gives police over 1,400 pages on training, laws, investigating accidents, police training, and identifying pills, among other things (inTime, n.d.). Other apps that are good include Miranda Warnings/Rights, PoliceOne App, First Aid App, Scanner 911, Notecam, InTime Scheduling App, Early Bird Alarm Clock, and Police Spanish Guide.
