Mary Midgley’s ideas are very important in English philosophy from the last part of the 1900s. During this time, people became very interested in ideas about different truths and what is right or wrong, while also feeling unsure about the idea of always following reason and moral rules. Trying Out One’s New Sword is a story that talks about why it’s not good to think that each group of people is separate and different from each other with their own rules and traditions.
The story talks about a special ritual in old Japan where a warrior would try out a new sword by testing it on a person they meet by chance. This strange tradition is not just in Japan but also in other places where people have different ideas about how to behave. The writer says that our own culture influences how we see other cultures and what we think is wrong with them. Sometimes we don’t understand other groups, and sometimes we criticize our own culture because of what we see in others.
Our opinions are based on our own values, but sometimes we don’t accept that others have different values. It’s hard to understand all the different religions if we only look at them from our own point of view. The writer says it’s okay to have opinions about other customs, but we should learn about our own culture first before judging others. Also, the writer believes that societies are not separate but always mixing together, especially in today's world.
In conclusion, Mary Midgley argues against the idea that each society is alone in its own beliefs and shares her thoughts on how to think about other cultures. It’s important to have our own ideas and opinions about different civilizations, but we should always be polite and avoid being rude. Every culture is different, but we all live in one world, so there should be no walls between us.
