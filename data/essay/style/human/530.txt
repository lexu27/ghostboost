Retailers, Wholesalers and Manufacturers are three groups that can help or harm a business's money. They all work in the chain of many big businesses that sell products. They are similar in some ways but very different in how they work with a company's products and shoppers. The differences are in how much stuff each group deals with and how they fit into the chain.

Retailers make money by buying things in large amounts for less from wholesalers and then selling them for more. They want to sell things quickly to not have too much stuff in storage. They sell things on a small scale and don't do big purchases. Retailers care a lot about customers and give them help when they come to buy things from different brands.

Wholesalers buy lots of items from makers and sell them to stores and shoppers for more cash. They take some risks and are like the middlemen in the chain. To do well, they need to buy a lot of stuff and give it to stores on time. If things don't sell and stores don't buy more, wholesalers might end up with too much stuff and no profit.

Manufacturers make goods that are then sold to wholesalers or directly to shoppers, depending on the industry. Like the other groups, they need to think about taxes, pay, and other costs. They have the least risk since they control how much they make and can adjust it based on what people want, so there's not much waste.
