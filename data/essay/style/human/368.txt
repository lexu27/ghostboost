Introduction
War changes, but stays the same in its core. For about twenty years, there has been a lot of fighting against bad groups all over the world. Leaders are looking for good ways to fight this kind of war and get soldiers ready. One way to do this is by using the Performance Triad and making leaders better while thinking about the special things in this kind of war.

How Leaders can Help their Groups for Irregular War
Irregular war is not like the usual wars and needs special training. It is about different kinds of violence by smaller groups, like terrorists and rebels. These groups have been causing trouble in places like Iraq, Afghanistan, Darfur, Uganda, and Chechnya. To fight well in this kind of war, soldiers need to be strong. The Performance Triad can help with this. It is a plan to make soldiers strong by focusing on health and good leadership. Sleep, exercise, and food are important for soldiers to work well. Good sleep helps soldiers think and move better. Being fit is key to being a good soldier. Eating well gives energy, helps recover faster, and makes soldiers feel good.

The goal of the Performance Triad is to keep soldiers and their families healthy and ready for anything. A program in 2013-2014 showed that good leadership and healthy habits can help soldiers be prepared and strong. This plan will make soldiers better at fighting in irregular wars.

Challenges of Mission Command in Irregular War
The world is more complicated now, and irregular wars are tricky. Terrorists, rebels, and criminals use technology and other ways to cause chaos. These groups want power and respect more than just fighting. To deal with this, leaders need to focus on solving the reasons why people are upset, not just fighting the bad guys. This is hard because wars today are not like before, where clear wins were possible. Success now means controlling and reducing the conflict, not just winning battles. Leaders need to understand the complex reasons behind these wars to make good decisions.

Adjusting Leadership in Irregular War
Leaders in the army need to be smart and think ahead in irregular wars. Intelligence is about knowing things and using that knowledge well. Leaders need to think carefully, be fair, and understand the effects of their decisions. They should be ready for what might happen next. Leaders also need to be aware of their strengths and weaknesses to lead well. Being innovative means finding new solutions and not being stuck in old ways. Creative leaders can find new ways to do things and challenge their teams.

In conclusion, there are better ways to fight in irregular wars without spending too much. The government has learned from working together in Iraq and Syria. It's important to share good ideas like the Performance Triad and keep learning about irregular wars. Also, leaders need to be quick and smart in these wars to adapt to the enemy's changing ways.
