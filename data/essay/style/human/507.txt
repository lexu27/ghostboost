The heroes from A New Hope are very good white people. Amidala and other alien ladies, like Twi’lek ladies, show a lot about how women are seen as wanting love and are the same across different races. Amidala brings in another white actor dressed like an Asian, and the Twi’leks show how different races can be won over as a sign of being special. These show that Berg (2009) believes that stereotypes are used in a very simple and strict way.

But, as the story goes on, the ideas about race and gender change. Finn is special as a brave and good black man, not like Lando Calrissian who was not always honest. Rei is also a big step forward for female heroes in Star Wars. She is not like the typical white woman who is seen as needing help or being sexy. She is strong, brave, and does not need anyone to save her. So maybe the stereotypes in the first Star Wars movies were not meant to be racist or sexist but were shown without thinking.
