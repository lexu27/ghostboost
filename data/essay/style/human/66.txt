The changes in how people think about love and marriage show how society is growing. Looking at Gen Z's habits can help us understand this better (Klein, 2022). People's thoughts about love and relationships are affected by what's happening around them. This means we need to look at both how people feel and what's going on in the world. One article we can learn from is "Are Gen Z more practical about love and relationships?" This article can help us understand complex events better.

Summary
In this article, Jessica Klein talks about how Gen Zers are waiting longer to get married and don't want long relationships. They focus more on themselves than on finding a partner. They see the benefits of being single and want to think about their lives before committing (Klein, 2022). Also, they know they need stability before starting a family. The pandemic has made things harder for them, so they are careful about choosing a partner (Klein, 2022). This means they take more time in this part of life and think more about themselves than about others.

Proof
The article is good because it uses evidence from many sources, like surveys and data (Klein, 2022). This helps make the findings stronger.
