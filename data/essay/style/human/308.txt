The Roman Empire believed in many gods. They thought these gods helped make Rome and did things in people's lives. Rome was close to Greece, so they shared ideas. Rome took some things from Greece and changed them a bit. Polybius said the Consul was like a king in Rome. There are stories that connect people in The Dream of Scipio. Rome had two army leaders who could talk to the Senate. Citizenship in Rome was complex. Only men could be full citizens. Kids of citizen parents were citizens too. In the United States, citizenship can be by birth or registration. People born in the U.S. or to U.S. parents are citizens. They can also get citizenship through marriage.
