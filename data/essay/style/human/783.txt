Introduction
Eastern Europe cultures are not same like American one. This essay talks about strange Russian festival called Maslenitsa that means "Nature waking up from sleep" (Maltseva, 2020, p. 26). In the beginning, it was pagan party and it says "Sun becoming a strong young man" (Maltseva, 2020, p. 26). So, in this festival, they say bye to winter and say hi to spring. Every year, the festival starts in different days because it depends on Passover and Vernal Equinox. Maslenitsa means a butter week. Besides Russian Maslenitsa, this essay talks about French Mardi Gras and Polish Tlusty Czwartek.

Reflection on the Event
I heard about this party from my Russian friend, who makes pancakes to celebrate it. After that, I watched a video on YouTube and it was very lively and fun. In the video, there are people singing, dancing, playing accordion, cooking pancakes, playing games like tug of war and building snow forts (CCTV Video News Agency, 2018). In the video, I noticed adults and kids both like to join. It is interesting that this party shows a strong unity because in games, there are two teams and strangers hold hands while dancing.

At first, the party seems boring like a fair where people eat and buy things. But later, when people play and dance, it becomes fun. However, what I saw didn't make me want to join. Also, burning a woman-shaped effigy of Maslenitsa is a little cruel.

Research on the Event
Maslenitsa is an old festival. Russia is a Christian country and religion is important there (Curanovic, 2019). After celebrating pagan Maslenitsa for a week, they start Great Lent for 40 days. So, Maslenitsa festival shows a mix of beliefs in one country. Before Russia became Christian, they were pagan and they kept celebrating Maslenitsa.

One interesting thing is that Maslenitsa lasts for a week. Every day, they eat pancakes to prepare for Great Lent (Maltseva, 2020). It might be hard for people from other cultures to eat pancakes with butter, sugar, caviar, and jams for a whole week. The event described earlier happens on the last day of Maslenitsa. Most people today only celebrate the last day and don't eat pancakes all week. Russian pancakes are not like American ones, they are like French crepes, and thinner and leakier is better.

Outside Influence and Historical Ways of Celebration
In recent years, cultures all over the world have changed because of globalization and westernization (Ergashev and Farxodjonova, 2020). Russian culture has changed too, but Maslenitsa traditions haven't changed much (Chetverikova, 2018). During this fest, people wear old clothes, sing old songs, and play old games. Some festivals might play Western music, but most follow their Slavic traditions.

From what I wrote earlier, we can see that Maslenitsa is celebrated just like in the past. The only difference is that now it doesn't have the pagan part. In the past, Slavic tribes saw Maslenitsa as the end of spring and a time to remember the dead (Wijethunga & Abeysinghe, 2018). Today, there is a day to visit graves of friends and family in Russian culture.

Secondary Cultural Events: Similarities
Maslenitsa is like other events in Europe and Latin America. In France, they have Mardi Gras, and in Poland, it's called Tlusty Czwartek. These events are based on the old Slavic tradition of saying bye to winter. Also, all three festivals are followed by Lent. So, people eat, dance, and have fun before fasting.

Secondary Cultural Events: Differences
Even though these events are similar, there are many differences too. The main difference is that in Poland and France, the events are one day, but Maslenitsa is a whole week. Also, while Russians eat greasy food all week, French and Polish people don't.

Food
Food is different in each festival. In Russia, pancakes are the main dish because they look like the sun. People might also make pies and cookies, but it's not a must. In France, they eat king cakes, cannoli, doughnuts, waffles, and more. Polish people eat doughnuts with rose or plum jam and angel wings. Pancakes are not popular in Poland.

Activities
The activities are different too. In France, Mardi Gras has masquerades and masked balls. People wear costumes and masks, not old clothes like Russians. Mardi Gras is like a carnival with fun costumes. Tlusty Czwartek is more like Mardi Gras than Maslenitsa because they also have masquerade balls. But unlike Mardi Gras, Polish people give doughnuts to each other. Like Maslenitsa, friends and family invite each other to eat pancakes during the week.

Conclusion
Maslenitsa is a fun festival in Russia where people eat lots of greasy and sweet food before Lent. Everyone, kids and adults, enjoy this party by playing games, singing, and dancing. Similar events happen in France and Poland too. Even though Mardi Gras and Tlusty Czwartek are more similar to each other than to Maslenitsa, they all come from the same old Slavic tradition.
