The constitution of every state has rules to keep people's rights safe, it is also true for New Jersey. New Jersey's constitution has 21 rules in Article I that talk about people's freedoms ( 1947 State Constitution , n.d). It says people are born free and have the right to be safe. People can join politics and have power there. But sometimes, rules can limit freedoms for the good of everyone.

One big rule is about saying what you think. You can talk, write, and share ideas, but be careful not to hurt others ( 1947 State Constitution , n.d, para. 8). If you say something bad and it's proven, you can get in trouble. This shows that sometimes, rules protect others' rights over yours. Other parts of Article I talk about how people are protected in legal cases and when they have to pay money. The rules also protect public meetings and talks if they help everyone.

So, New Jersey's rules keep people's rights safe. But these rights should work with what's good for everyone. People must remember that sometimes, others' rights limit what they can do.
