Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a sickness that lasts a long time and makes a person have thoughts and do things again and again that they cannot control. We talk about Robert, a young man of twenty-three years. He went to a place for mental health to get help for feeling very worried, but they found out that he actually has OCD because he smelled very clean and talked about cleaning a lot. After he touched things or people, Robert really wanted to clean his hands with a strong liquid. He cleaned his hands maybe thirty times a day, which made his skin very bad. But he was very afraid of dirt, so he had to clean his hands every time he touched something. This problem with being clean made him very sad.

When the virus time started, the OCD got worse for Robert. He said he wore a special suit outside because he was scared of getting sick. In his social life, Robert did not want to touch people and liked to stay far from them. He worked from home, which made him happy because he did not have to go out and be with others in a small place. Robert did not need help from others for his OCD and liked to be alone most of the time. For Robert, he could do a kind of therapy and take medicine. They can help Robert with his OCD by training his brain and changing his behaviors. It is thought that Robert will feel better in a few weeks.
