Daniel R. Spanjer talks about important tools to think about the world. Spanjer says people are not just from nature, and not only by nature (3). God made rules to help people make choices. Christians must learn about religion to know how the world works. Learning Christianity helps with Liberal Arts (2). Knowing about God and people is important for now and the future.

The world has three parts: physical, logical, and human. They work together to make the world complex. Each part has its own things (Spanjer 10-13). Each part follows its own rules. Students learning Liberal Arts must see how these parts work together.

The main point of this chapter is to know the rules of what you study. Spanjer says you can't understand something without knowing its rules. This idea, when looking at Christianity, helps us see human nature and morals in a bigger way. People are also part of a big system. Learning Liberal Arts helps organize knowledge about the world based on levels and connections.
