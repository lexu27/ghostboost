While the problem with the COVID-19 sickness is serious, the idea of needing to get a shot at work is arguable. I believe it is right because it helps to stop the sickness; those who don't want the shot should be sure they won't spread the sickness caused by the coronavirus. But, this choice needs more steps to make sure the shot is safe and good for people. Even though there's not much time, as we must beat the sickness as soon as we can, the rules that say many people must get the shot, or they will get big fines, are extreme. They should be done with care, as they may limit people's rights and not be fair, although sometimes they are needed to deal with hard situations. In my view, the sickness is one of those situations, and we must win over it.
I think that making the shot required is okay as long as everyone who gets it knows clearly what will happen during it. This means the shot should be checked, and all the results should be shown to every person. I feel it would be better if people could watch all the steps of making the shot. I would feel much more sure about getting the shot, even though I believe getting the shot is good either way.
So, I support the idea of everyone needing the shot. But, when we talk about the whole country getting the shot, it is important to remember that many people are scared to get it: I think, most of the time, they are scared to hurt themselves. If they don't fear that, they will be more likely to get the shot, as everyone wants to be well. In the end, I think that while making the shot required is a big step, it is needed to beat the sickness; still, the government should make sure the shot process is clear and safe for all people.
