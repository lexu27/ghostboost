The chapter talks about BP's choices about the oil spill and if they were good or bad using a way called utilitarianism. This way looks at if the result of an action is good or bad (Halbert and Ingulli 1). When we study what BP did, we need to think about everyone involved. First, the money they lost was a lot because of fines, penalties, lawsuits, and lost business. But we must think about what will happen later, not just now. Next, the people who own part of the company also lost a lot. Then, the workers who got hurt or sick from the spill. Also, the Gulf area is very important for fish and other sea animals. We don't know how bad it will get for them, but we know the bad stuff won't just go away. And the people who live there and depend on the sea for their jobs and food got hurt too. Even if the FDA says the food is okay, we don't know if people will get sick later (Halbert and Ingulli 3). The Gulf is important for animals outside it too. So, BP's choice not to have a backup plan will cause problems, but drilling deep might help the country's money.
