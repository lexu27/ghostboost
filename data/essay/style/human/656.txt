The big sickness changed how people live. The paper talks about how it affects students in Saudi Arabia. They want to know if the change to a new way of life because of the sickness makes students anxious.
The researchers had to do a study to get info to understand how anxiety changes in students. Khoshaim et al. (2020) asked 400 students from different schools online about their feelings and if they noticed any changes because of COVID-19. They sent the questions to students from March to June in 2020, when the sickness was very bad (Khoshaim et al., 2020). They found that 35% of students felt a lot of anxiety, which made studying hard for them. This study is important because students are still affected by changes in education due to COVID-19.
The results may not be totally accurate because students might be anxious for other reasons when they answer the questions. But this study can help with more research that looks deeper into how students are feeling because of COVID-19 and the rules that came after. The government can use this info to help students feel less anxious and do better in school.
