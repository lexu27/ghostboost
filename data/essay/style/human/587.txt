Strategic planning is very important for leaders. It helps them decide what the team should focus on. Some people think it's confusing, but it's different from business planning. 

A smart man named Roger L. Martin said a good strategy doesn't need lots of research. It should come naturally. I agree partly, but I think some research and planning are important. You need to learn how to plan well. 

Remember, strategic planning and business planning are not the same. They are different but work together. Business planning is about goals, while strategic planning is about reaching those goals. 

In short, a strategic plan is a guide for achieving goals. It's important for managers to learn and plan before acting quickly. Strategic planning and business planning go hand in hand.
