Business world always changing. Companies must flexible to changes. One change is bigger target market. P&G sells products mostly to women. But more men want grooming products now. P&G should change to sell to men too.

P&G needs changes to reach new market. This affects research, product design, and sales. More men should work in these areas. Currently, mostly women work with beauty products. To attract men, P&G needs to hire more men. Men understand what men want better.

P&G changed because more men want grooming products. Other companies also change to reach new market. Harley Davidson, NFL, and Stryx are examples. They all found success in reaching new customers. All companies should adapt to market changes.

In summary, companies must keep updated with market changes. It's not smart to stick to old ways. P&G can make money from new market. It needs to change how it hires to do this. Like Harley Davidson, NFL, and Stryx, restructuring for new customers can bring profit.
