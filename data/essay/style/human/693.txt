The Book The Rise of the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade in Western Africa, 1300-1589 is by Toby Green. He looks at the time in Iberia and West Africa between 1300 and 1589. The book talks about how Europeans and Africans started to talk to each other. The main part of the book is about 1460 to 1589 when Cape Verde Islands had many trades. The book is good for people who like history about the sea and Europe. But it might not always be right about what happened. Green talks about how Cape Verde had Europeans who took Africans for work. He also talks about people from Iberia who were Jewish and used to violence. They made a new place with slavery. The book also talks about other places with slavery. Green uses old papers from Europe, Latin America, and the Caribbean. He mostly talks about places near the sea. Green also talks about the start of Europeans coming to Cape Verde and West Africa. At the end, he says Europeans used what they learned in Africa in the Americas. Green wants to say that we don't know how many Africans were taken. He also says Europeans did not care much about gold at first. He thinks Cape Verde and Upper Guinea were very important. But others say we need to look at all the early trades from Africa. Green talks about how Africa's trade changed the Americas. But some people think he is not right. So, the book helps us know about the start of the slave trade in Africa.
