Introduction
The white-tailed deer is in Canada and most of the United States, not Hawaii, Alaska, and Southwest. It has a gray-brown coat in the winter and red-brown in the summer. The bottom of its tail is white, so it is named “white-tailed deer.” The nose, throat, belly, and mouth area are also white. Young deer under six months have white spots on their coat. Boys have horns that fall off in January or December and grow back in April or May.

Home
White-tailed deer live in many places. They like a mix of lands like farms, forests, and bushes. They stay in bushy areas, farms, woods, and meadows. Baby deer need a different home from grown-up deer.

Family
Baby deer come in late autumn or early winter after about 202 days. Girl deer have babies when they are about one and a half years old. Young moms have one baby, while older moms have twins until they are about 10-15 years old. Most babies are born in June or May, weighing 3-6 pounds. They have red-brown fur with white spots. They eat when they are born and walk at less than a day old. Boys grow antlers at one year old and get new ones every year until they are about six.

Food
Deer eat plants and follow trails to find food. They eat different things in different seasons. They have four stomachs to digest food. They need about 5-7 pounds of food every day. Girls need more food in the winter.

Moving
In the spring, deer are busy at dawn and dusk, while in summer, they are active during the day. They move more before and after storms. They eat more when the days are longer. When they are still, they stay down or stand quietly. They can lose a lot of weight and still live.

Living
Deer live in small areas with their family. Males live together, and moms are alone when they don’t have babies.

Survival
Deer have few predators like lions and wolves. Sometimes they have too many deer and not enough food, so hunting is allowed.

Changes
Deer change colors with the seasons to hide. They have a good sense of smell and hearing. They run fast and jump high. Boys use their antlers to fight. They use their smell to talk to each other.

End
In the end, white-tailed deer live in different places and have babies when they are young. They need lots of food and move more in the summer. They have few predators and change with the seasons to stay safe.
