The issue about tribes has been looked at for many years. Tribes have been treated in different ways, from being helped and included in the larger community to being treated very badly. The law about tribal games is seen as a good step towards understanding the tribes’ special way of life and their ability to make decisions for themselves. This essay talks about how tribal games can help the tribes’ independence.

Under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, tribes were allowed to choose what games they wanted to play, with most states agreeing to this. The games could be part of tribal traditions or just games of luck, depending on what the tribes wanted and what the state allowed. Since tribal games are often special and meaningful to the tribe, it is important to let them have their own games. This helps to keep their culture alive and lets them have control over an important part of life, which is having fun. Also, playing games helps to keep their traditions and customs alive through rituals that have been around for a long time.

When it comes to independence, games help to show which parts of life are fully controlled by the tribes. For example, some tribal people live in big cities and work there. But playing games, especially traditional ones, reminds them of where they come from, gives them the freedom to choose, and shows their independence because games are something they have control over.
