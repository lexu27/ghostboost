In every hospital, nurses must be good and follow the rules to help sick people. The connection between the sick person, family, and nurse is very important for good service. Nurses sometimes have to make hard decisions but they must think about the patient and family (Bratz & Sandoval-Ramirez, 2018).

When Mr. Newcomb is very sick, I think it's okay for him to see his friend. He has cancer and is in a lot of pain, so it's important to make him happy. It's important for him to have good moments before he dies. Making Mr. Newcomb happy is the most important thing now to help him live longer.

If I say no, Mr. Newcomb may not trust me anymore, so I have to say yes to keep him happy. It's good for him, but his wife may not like it. I will keep it a secret after I ask Mr. Newcomb about his friend. If their relationship is good, I will find a way for them to meet.

Helping the Patient
In healthcare, nurses should be kind and help the patient. It's important to do things that make the patient happy and keep them safe (Giles et al., 2018). Letting Mr. Newcomb see his friend is a good thing because it makes him happy and helps his health. Keeping it a secret is also good to protect him from feeling bad and getting worse.

Not Causing Harm
Nurses should not do things that hurt the patient. If I say no to Mr. Newcomb, he will feel sad and hurt. So, I have to find a way for him to see his friend to help him. I know that saying no would make him feel worse, so I have to follow this rule (Ilkafah et al., 2021).

Patient's Right to Decide
Patients can choose what they want for themselves. Mr. Newcomb wanted to see his friend, so I let him decide. Letting him see his friend is good for him and follows this rule. Letting him decide helps him get better care (Silva & Oliveira, 2020).

Being Fair
Nurses should treat all patients the same. Letting Mr. Newcomb see his friend is fair and good for him. Being fair means being good to the patient and showing care (Silva & Oliveira, 2020).

My Thoughts and Values
My beliefs are important in helping patients. Caring for others is important to me, so I try to help them feel better. If patients can't have what they want, they may feel sad and not trust me. So, I use my values to help me make good decisions for the patient (Sari et al., 2018).

Helping Patients Take Care of Themselves
Nurses do many things to help patients stay healthy. They need good plans to help patients take care of themselves. Patients need to eat well, exercise, and have friends to feel better.
