Coronavirus has big effect on people's health worldwide for two reasons. One is the virus itself, which makes people sick, and the other is trying to stay healthy during the pandemic. It is very important to keep moving and do exercises to stay in good shape, make the body stronger, and lower the chance of getting sick. 
COVID-19 makes it hard to be active. Being close to others is the main way the virus spreads, so it's not safe to exercise in public places like gyms where there isn't enough space to stay far apart. But it's very important now to keep moving because the virus is changing, so regular exercise can help prevent problems and keep people healthy. Some exercises to do are push-ups, stepping up on stairs, shoulder raises, jumping rope, or just walking. Doing these can help people stay healthy during quarantine.
Being active is really important, especially now because of COVID-19. It's harder to exercise now, but it's even more important to take care of the body and health. Doing cardio and strength exercises can help people stay active, improve health, and lower the risk of getting sick.
