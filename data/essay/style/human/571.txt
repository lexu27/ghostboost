Social insurance programs help old people by giving money and health care. Some people think they are not very good because they do not make big changes in people's lives or make them rich. But they do help stop poor people and make things more equal. Greenberg and Page (2018) say social security was started to add to work pensions, but many old people only have social security money. Payroll taxes might not seem fair, but they help make sure there is not too much poverty in the future. Medicare helps old people without money get medical care. Even though social insurance programs might not seem good, their original goal was to help people with few resources and they do that well.

Social insurance programs are connected to money and politics. The first social security was for Civil war soldiers, and the Great Depression made people think about how to help old people more. Money and politics decide how long social security programs last. The government's values decide how social insurance works, like when people retire and how much tax they pay. Bad economic trends or changes in government can make social insurance worse.
