Since business is about talking and being friends with people, how people act is very important. When we talk about how businesses make friends with people, one big idea is marketing and ads. These things help plan important stuff for companies like brand ideas and making people buy things. Many companies, new and old, are finding ways to use the idea of making people think all brands are the same in their plans.

To talk about brand ideas, we need to first talk about how our brains work and how we react to things. The idea about how our brains change what we see is linked to making brand ideas because we always see things. This idea says that info we get from the world goes through our brains in different ways, not just simple reactions. In business, we can use this idea in marketing and ads since these are all about talking to people, even possible buyers.

A brand idea is a plan that says what a brand wants to be known for in the long run so that people will like it. The brand's goal, how it treats customers, and how it looks are all part of a good brand plan. A brand plan isn’t just a logo, colors, or a website; even though these things are important, they can be misunderstood. Everything that makes people know and like a brand over time is important for a brand plan. A good brand plan wants to tell everyone that a brand is here, what it stands for, and what makes it special. Every business can pick a special way to see if they are doing well, but they all have the same ideas in their plans.

Talking about the different ideas that influence brand plans, it’s important to talk about learning and remembering things that look good. By talking about learning and remembering, we need to look at how we learn things and how we act based on what we see. Learning by getting rewards after doing something good is called operant learning. Customers might do something if they think it will make them happy in the end. The things that make people do certain things can keep them doing them if they get good or bad things after, not when they don’t. These things can make people act in a certain way.

To make people buy things, brands often use the idea of thinking all things are the same. Doing what we already know in new situations is called thinking all things are the same. It’s like knowing how to act in one place and doing the same in another. By thinking this way when making a brand plan, we can use this idea in new and old companies. A famous brand usually has a look that people trust and know right away. People think the products are good when they see this look. A new or not so known business might copy this look to make people think of the famous brand when they see it. They want people to feel the same way about their products. This can help them sell more.

Big companies can also use this idea to sell more things. They might use the same look for many products. People might have liked one product before and when they see the same look on another product, they might buy it because they trust the brand. Some people might think this is not fair, while companies might say they are just using what people like. The way people buy things can change because of thinking things are the same, whether companies see it as good or bad.

It’s also important to see how companies can make brand plans by thinking about what makes them different from others, which is the opposite of thinking all things are the same. When we see something different and it makes us react in a certain way, it’s called thinking things are different. This makes us act quickly, often, and for a longer time. Then, the way we act is controlled by what we see. When we get rewarded for acting a certain way only when we see a specific thing, that thing becomes different. When we talk about this idea in brand plans, companies can use it to make people react quickly when needed. When it comes to marketing and branding plans, thinking things are different happens when a company uses a design that makes them stand out from others. They want to show people why they are not like others and make them react faster.
