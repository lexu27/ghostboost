Since skiing is very dangerous, the company should have been more careful to keep skiers safe. But, the workers of the company made mistakes that hurt Mr. Craig and Mr. Alex. Even though it was April and the slopes were meant to be closed, the company still shares some blame. They shouldn't have let people ski after the snowstorm, even if they couldn't stop them. This put the skiers and the staff at risk.

Mr. Alex got hurt by Mr. Craig, but it's not all Mr. Craig's fault. It wouldn't have happened if Dan and Abby didn't send him to the risky slope without a teacher to keep him safe. So, the company and Mr. Craig are both responsible for the accident. But, Mr. Craig shouldn't have to pay for Mr. Alex's treatment because Dan and Abby are the ones who caused the accident. The company should pay for the damaged ski equipment too.

Skiing is risky, so Mr. Alex should have known the dangers. He chose to ski alone on a hard slope because he thought he could handle it. He tried to avoid the crash and followed the rules of skiing. It was Mr. Craig who caused the accident, along with those who let an inexperienced skier go to the dangerous slope.
