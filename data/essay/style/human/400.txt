The law called CALM Act in 2012 was made by Anna Eshoo to say how loud a TV ad can be. Some say, Anna got the idea for the law when she heard a very loud ad while eating with her family. After the CALM Act began, the number of complaints got a bit less, but not all the way. This is 'cause the law was not perfect and there were ways to make a loud ad without breaking the rules. 'Cause of COVID-19, more people watched TV and complaints went up by 140 percent, showing that the law had good and bad effects (Yang et al., 2021). Most of the trouble comes from changing the sound in tricky ways, like making quiet sounds louder without making the whole thing louder too.
