Diversicare Medical Care (formerly Advocat) offers many health and living services for old people through care and living places, mostly in the south and southwest of the United States. This company is a health center that focuses on caring for people after they have been sick. It began in 1994 with a strong belief in helping others. Remembering care, short help to get better, long help, and medical care are some of the services it gives. It is in Brentwood, Tennessee, and its goal is to make the lives of all its helpers better by doing more than what they expect and giving great health care. Honesty, kindness, greatness, working together, and taking care of things are its main beliefs. It has more than 6,800 workers in over 60 different places across nine states.
The workers’ future money includes life insurance, a 401k plan with an extra, learning more for their job, time off when they are sick, a plan for when they are hurt for a short or a long time, and health, teeth, and hope plans. This text will look at the company’s strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and risks, as well as its money and plans.
Strengths
Diversicare’s main care has a good name for giving clients good help. Also, the medical care makes sure that the workers and clients stay with them for a long time. There is a good group of workers who can speak two languages, and they are ready to learn more. But, the Ethnic Society Council Queensland’s (ECCQ) Public Compassionate Institute (PBI) Co-payment Gift Recipient (DGR) is trying to make the company better.
Weaknesses
One of Diversicare’s problems is that its workers do not have enough skills for the job. The workers are getting older, which stops the company from growing. Also, most of the money the company gets is from the government. Because of this, Diversicare needs a plan for the future for the important people who work there. As an ECCQ part, this company does not have a legal status, which is bad for the company. Also, Diversicare has too many workers for the work they have now, which is a problem for their health care.
Opportunities
More and more people need care, especially for people who do not speak English well. Also, the company wants to use new technologies to give better help, especially at home. They plan to help more people in different places in Queensland. More and more people who are working and not born in Australia are moving to Queensland. The company can give more help to people and ask the government for more money to grow.
Threats
Diversicare may have problems because of the government. Other companies may be better than them and take away their clients. The company may join with other companies, which can be bad for the company. The ECCQ may want to know why the company is not giving good care to old people. Also, the workers may not have the skills they need for the job in the future.
Financial Analysis and Plan
Diversicare has been able to help many people around the world. But, they are getting more clients, so they need more space for them. After looking at their money, they want to open more beds so they can help more people. This health care wants to help people in their homes and give them good care.
The company has more than 75 health care and living places with about 8,500 beds. They want to add more beds to help more people. Diversicare is focusing on places that are not big cities and gives many different health care services. The table shows the money plan for the new plan.
