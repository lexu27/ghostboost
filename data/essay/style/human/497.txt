Price bundling is when stores sell lots of things together to make more money and make customers happy. It's like a special offer where you get a good price if you buy many things at once. This makes customers happy because they get a discount. People like to buy bundles because they save money and get things they like. Many stores do this, like fast-food places such as McDonaldâ€™s and Burger King. They offer meals with different foods for a better price than buying each food separately.
