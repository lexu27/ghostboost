Banana is yummy fruit that grows in many places and is good for health. Bananas are very important in poor countries where they help with food and money. They are big in Africa, Asia, and Latin America for growing and selling (MacKinnon & Cumbers, 2019). Most bananas come from Central and South America, and the Philippines, and are sent to places like the EU, the USA, China, Russia, and Japan (MacKinnon & Cumbers, 2019). Around 130 million tons of bananas are grown each year (MacKinnon & Cumbers, 2019). A lot of bananas are eaten by farmers or sold nearby. In Africa, many people rely on bananas for energy (MacKinnon & Cumbers, 2019).

Lots of bananas come from Ecuador and the Philippines, and China and the EU really like to buy them (MacKinnon & Cumbers, 2019). Big stores from these countries now buy bananas straight from the growers instead of the big fruit companies (MacKinnon & Cumbers, 2019). Sometimes, there are arguments about who gets the most from selling bananas. Some workers don't get much money or good conditions (MacKinnon & Cumbers, 2019). The main problem now is that making lots of bananas might harm the environment and people (MacKinnon & Cumbers, 2019).
