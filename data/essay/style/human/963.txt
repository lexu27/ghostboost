Directional strategies are very important for the big decisions in a company. They help the bosses make choices. The main directional strategies are vision, mission, goals, and values. The vision shows a picture of the company to the people. The mission tells why the company is different and what it does. It also says what the company sells and to whom. Goals are what the company wants to achieve. Lastly, values are the important rules that make the company's culture. On the other hand, strategic alternatives are about finding and studying information and being open to new and creative ideas for the future.
