According to talk, olden times culture was in a ten years with many sickness, not much food, people not happy, and wanting to move up social class. I think the main point was when many people got sick from the Black Death, it messed up how people lived (Tuchman 230). Before the sickness, life for poor people was good and doctors were getting better. The church was very important and changing fast in that time. Many people could understand the church talk because it was in common language. Also, most people couldn't read and books were expensive. Women had to listen to their husbands and children had to be good. Society had rules for everyone to follow.
