The work in an office for medical stuff is about doing many papers and helping with doctors. I will have a job talk in a very official way. I have a nice black suit for this talk, so I won't spend lots of money. If it's hot, I can wear the suit, and if it's cold, I can wear a coat too. 
For work clothes, I might need to buy special clothes called scrubs that are cheap. I need good shoes too because I may have to stand a lot. I have shoes that fit the rules. Some hospitals give clothes, so maybe I won't need to buy any. 
Thinking about all this, it won't cost me much. If the hospital gives me clothes, I don't need money. If not, I can still buy what I need within my budget. So, I can save $200 and get ready for the talk. I'm ready for interviews and work clothes.
