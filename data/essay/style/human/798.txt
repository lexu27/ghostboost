Alan Westin finds four main reasons for privacy: personal independence, letting out emotions, understanding oneself, and keeping important talks private. The first one is about how privacy helps keep a person feeling unique. Emotional release is when people need to let go of stress from living in a society where privacy is really important. Privacy is also key for self-understanding because it helps with thinking deeply about oneself. Limited and protected communication means sharing secret details only with chosen people, not everyone.

The Constitution doesn't talk about privacy directly. The Supreme Court's view is similar, not focusing only on privacy. For instance, in City of Ontario v. Quon, the Court cared about privacy in relation to allowing a government search of text messages. This means the Court didn't spell out a specific right to privacy, but talked about the details of allowing a search based on the Constitution. So, if the Supreme Court finds privacy in the Constitution, it's okay.

Westin and the Supreme Court mostly agree on privacy. In Riley v. California, the Court said searching a cell phone without a warrant is wrong and realized how important digital devices are to people's identities. The need for safe digital talks matches with Westin's idea of keeping talks private. Also, the big amount of personal data on a phone can be a big part of a person's identity, connecting to personal independence and self-understanding. So, the Supreme Court's view on privacy shows it sees the value of privacy functions like Westin does.
