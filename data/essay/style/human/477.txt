Morality as a System of Hypothetical Imperatives is a book by Philippa Foot who questions Kant’s idea of morality. Kant says moral judgment can’t be a hypothetical command but a universal one. Foot thinks morality should be seen as hypothetical commands because it’s like etiquette. 
Morals driven by categorical commands mean a different kind of “should.” Foot compares morals to etiquette, saying they're similar. A person breaking etiquette rules can’t use that as an excuse. So, Foot says etiquette and morals both use categorical commands, making them alike. 
Foot then argues about why people follow moral rules. She says following a moral rule can be unreasonable, making a person amoral or evil, not irrational. If someone can choose not to follow these rules for any reason, that means moral rules are hypothetical commands, not categorical. People can still act morally even if they’re not forced to. Foot says if moral judgment is a hypothetical command, then there must be other reasons why people stay moral, like the desire for justice, kindness, freedom, and other good qualities.
