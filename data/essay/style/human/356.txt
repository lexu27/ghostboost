Diamonds by Rihanna was first heard on Elvis Duran Show on September 26, 2012. It was put online for downloading one hour later and came out as the main song of the album the next day. Sia wrote the song for Rihanna, who has the song’s rights and worked on it a year ago. The song is owned by an outside worker (Anggraini 12). Unapologetic is Rihanna's seventh album, and the song "Diamonds" is on it (Anggraini 7). Rihanna used Sia’s demo singing to copy her style very precisely. It was only when Benny Blanco heard the finished track that the Australian singer realized the singing belonged only to her.

In Diamonds, Rihanna thought about love and diamonds: “Yellow diamonds in the light. To make things even more awkward, we’re standing next to each other. You cross my path as your shadow does.” The diamonds in the song mean a bright side that shows the chance for a better future and happier days in dark times. The song made me think about the options when things aren’t as expected.

I chose the song because it's positive and hopeful. It always puts me in a good mood. It's also inspiring as it tells people to love themselves. Since it came out, the song has won many awards and been very successful. It really helped Rihanna's career because it was so catchy and recognizable from the start.
