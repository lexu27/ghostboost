As Mongols grew land, they became strong and caused pain to those who said no to them. In Abbasid Empire and Section 7: The Rise of the Mongols, it's said that Mongols did anything to get power. In Abbasid Empire, they made Muslims obey using talks and orders. When Muslims didn't help fight Persians, Hulagu killed people in Baghdad, making the city empty for a long time. Genghis Khan knew Muslim states were strong, so his grandson, Hulagu, tried talking with Afghanistan and Turkestan first. But when they said no, Genghis Khan attacked Turkestan, killing everything.
One difference is when Chinson Bayan attacked Southern China, Kublai Khan let the empress live in a nice palace. When her husband, the Song Emperor, heard this, he went back but got captured and killed. Different from this, when they invaded Abbasid Empire, Hulagu destroyed places of learning and killed many, even the caliph. Unlike Genghis Khan, who gave gold to the sultan, Hulagu's men rolled the caliph in a carpet and rode over him.
