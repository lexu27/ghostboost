There good reason to believe that two letters came together to make the code for genes. It is thought that there were fewer amino acids long ago because the two letters could only make 16 amino acids. If we have four letters in DNA, and we can mix them in 16 ways, we get 16 amino acids. This means that the old proteins had fewer amino acids from the two-letter code. When we tried to change one or two letters in a gene, no protein was made. But if we added a third letter, the right order came back. The latest gene code has 64 codes for 20 amino acids. The code can have many meanings for one amino acid. Each code means one amino acid, but some amino acids have more than one code. Like, tryptophan and methionine have one code each, except for some stop codes. Isoleucine has three codes, while valine, threonine, glycine, proline, and alanine have four codes. Arginine, serine, and leucine have six codes, and the other nine amino acids have two codes. This shows that long ago, there was a two-letter code for 16 amino acids. The first two bases in the code are more important than the third. The connection between the mRNA and tRNA is stronger with the first two bases. The third base connects more loosely.
If a DNA has 70% G + C, it needs more heat to split the strands than DNA with 45% G + C. The stability of the DNA double helix depends on many things like length, sequence, bases, and mistakes. Temperature changes can also affect this stability. DNA with more G + C is stronger because G + C bases stick together better. This makes it harder to melt the DNA, needing more heat. When doing polymerase chain reactions, DNA with more G + C needs higher heat for splitting. The time needed for DNA with high G + C is also longer. This is because the DNA is very stable with high G + C, needing more heat and time to split the strands. So, if DNA has more G + C and is longer, more heat is needed to split it compared to DNA with less G + C.
