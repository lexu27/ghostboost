It is not secret that some people have more things than others. People are left out because of their color, family, or how much money they have. I saw a lady who was Black not allowed in a food house for no known reasons. I was scared about what was happening there. People should not be mean because of their color. Being mean because of color is a bad thing in today's world.

This small example shows a bigger problem of being unfair to people in the law system. The law system in the United States is made to keep everyone safe. This should include all colors, genders, and other things about them. It happens more than what the news tells, but it shouldn't. People who are not like most people are often treated differently by the ones who should keep them safe. The writer talks about groups of people who are hurt by the system and how he helped them get justice. It seems like the system is unfair to minorities and it makes people suffer for no good reason.

A big example is the story of George Floyd. When I saw the video of George Floyd being killed, I felt very sad and angry. I didn't feel surprised because bad things have been happening to Black people for a long time. It made me feel powerless.

That someone who should keep us safe chose to do the opposite and kill someone so openly. It is the same feeling of hopelessness that the people watching Floyd must have felt, and the same helplessness that George must have felt when he was asking for help in his last minutes. It makes you want to do something.

One thing we learn from the Black Lives Matter movement is that just not being mean is not enough; we all must speak up against being mean. If we say nothing, people might think we agree with the bad things happening. We all must help those who are suffering. It's not just about posting on social media; it's also about talking with friends and family, giving, buying things from fair places, or writing to leaders about making fair rules. This is what the writer talked about, asking for fair thinking in each case, not being unfair, and helping people.

We can't ignore what happened last year. The suffering of those who have less than us is shown for everyone to see. We must do something because we can't ignore it. We must use our care for others and do something about it. Even though we see these bad things happening, police are hardly ever punished for being too rough. People are asking for justice because they think nobody is being held responsible.
