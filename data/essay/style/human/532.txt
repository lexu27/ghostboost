In her important book A Vindication of the Rights of Women, Mary Wollstonecraft says that learning is very important for being good and thinking in the right way. She thinks that using our own reason is the best way to be good and smart (Wollstonecraft 21). But at her time, women couldn't go to school like men and didn't have many chances to learn new things. Wollstonecraft's ideas are like Plato and his story about the Cave. Plato says that what we see might not be real, and if we don't learn, we won't know the truth (Plato). So, Wollstonecraft believes that women, just like men, should have the right to learn because it changes them and their world.

In A Vindication of the Rights of Women, Mary Wollstonecraft says that men and women are the same and should have the same rights and chances in life. She says that even though men and women are different, they should be good in the same way based on who they are (Wollstonecraft 27). Wollstonecraft talks against people who think women should just look pretty and have babies. Some people say she started the feminist movement, especially the part that talks about being independent and having your own ideas. Her strong support for women's education made many women want to learn more, understand the world, and be better people.
