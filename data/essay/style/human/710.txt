Today, many people like to look at the Internet more than they sleep. Young people, especially teenagers, who can't control their time or the things they see on social media are the most affected. They take in a lot of information from the Internet but don't think about it carefully. This can make them feel bad in their mind and body and put them at risk of being tricked. Since the Internet has a lot of information and some of it is bad, researchers are studying how it affects teenagers. They want to know the dangers, why they happen, and how to fix them. This writing talks about how new technology affects teenagers, like making them less healthy, at risk of being tricked, and losing their values.

Young people using social media can have problems with their health. For example, sitting in a bad way while looking at social media can hurt the neck and back and cause pain. Also, the bright screen can hurt the eyes and make it hard to sleep. Talking online can also affect how they feel, which can't always be fixed. They learn to talk to others but not in a good way, which affects how they communicate. This shows that if technology is used wrong, it can hurt in many ways.

Using social media can also make young people forget about what's right and wrong. Posting things about smoking or drinking on Instagram can make it seem okay for teenagers to do these things. Seeing violence or bad things online can also make them act poorly. This can make it hard for them to know what's right or wrong. This can also affect how they see smoking and drinking, and if they think it's okay. This is bad for their values.

More young people using technology has made it easier for them to get involved in bad things, like crime and bad experiences. Looking at things they shouldn't can make them curious and take risks. They might share personal things online with strangers. Children can also get involved in bad things online, sometimes because they want to. This increases the risk of crimes, especially against teenagers, because not all information online is safe.

In conclusion, the Internet has a big bad effect on teenagers who are still figuring things out. It shows that teenagers need to be careful about what they see online. They also need to know about the dangers of using too much technology.
