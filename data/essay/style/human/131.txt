One of the special things about nursing is how nurses always must adapt to the changing health care world and how they care for patients. To help with this, there are some ideas called change theories that try to organize how we can bring in new ways of doing things. The two main theories in nursing are Lewin’s and Roger’s theories. In Lewin’s idea, there are three big steps: first, we have to get ready for a change, then we make the change, and lastly, we make sure the change sticks (Udod & Wagner, 2018). So, with this plan, the team has to understand how things work now, make changes, and then make sure everyone agrees with the new way.
Roger’s idea is different because it focuses more on how the staff reacts and agrees with the change over time. This plan includes doing lots of research beforehand, listening to what the staff thinks, trying out the change in a small way first, and then making the change for real (Udod & Wagner, 2018). So, Lewin’s plan is more about making sure the changes are based on facts, while Roger’s plan is more about showing that the change helps in real life at work.
For our final project, Roger’s way of making changes seems better. Since our project is about proving that training on evidence-based care can make nurses feel more confident and make patients happier, the information we get from trying this out will be super important for making these changes in nursing. Our teacher also thinks Roger’s plan is good because she used it to make changes in how the staff’s work hours are scheduled.
