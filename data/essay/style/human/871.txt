The fast changes in the market make companies adapt quickly. This makes things change fast inside the company without being smooth. This fast speed is a problem for the company and workers. Workers must quickly get used to new ways of working, learn new things fast, and do more work. In this situation, good change management and decision-making are very important.

Nowadays, change management is very important for companies to be successful. Everything is always changing: what customers want, new things in the market, and unexpected problems. Companies that can't keep up and change with the times might have to stop working, and other companies that can change faster will take their place. The main worry is that fast changes make workers worried and unhappy. This can lead to more sick days, time off work, complaining, and workers leaving their jobs. People are worried about their jobs, what will happen next, and more competition. This can be made worse if workers can't learn new technology, if they don't talk well with each other, and if they work in a bad environment.

Making decisions can be hard, especially in a crisis. The crisis is a serious problem that can make decisions worse. Many people don’t have enough experience or strength to make a decision and take responsibility. Bad decisions can happen because of many mistakes inside or outside the company. Inside mistakes are about the person making the decision. They can try to be calm and think well. Outside mistakes are about the situation and other people affecting the decision. These decisions might not have enough time, be good enough, or have the right information, depending on others or the worker’s position. All these things can make it hard to make a decision.
