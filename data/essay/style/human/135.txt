It is important to know the big difference between a leader and a regular worker in any job. The boss of a company usually looks at money stuff inside, but a good leader knows that employees are super important. A great leader sees good things in everyone and helps them grow while working together nicely instead of pushing too hard. When leaders do things the wrong way, it can cause bad stuff for everyone in a business.

There are many not good leaders everywhere nowadays. Bad things can happen at any level, from small to big. It's hard to point to one person without seeing it for yourself, but numbers say that a lot of high-up folks are not honest. For example, the person who owns Ali Express store, Jack Ma, might be a bad leader. There's lots of proof that many things you can buy there are made by kids from poor places. With Jack Ma's silent okay, lots of folks are being used for little money and bad living conditions. This shows he's not just a bad leader but also breaks human rights. A big issue here is not caring and being kind. A not good leader always sees people as things to use and cheap workers. They can't understand what others want because they only think about themselves. This is very wrong and won't lead to anything good. But remember, it's a serious thing to say and needs more info to be sure.

Treating people poorly in any relationship, from work to politics, won't end well. Good people won't put up with that and will find better places quickly. The main problem for many bosses is thinking too much about themselves and using others in a bad way.
