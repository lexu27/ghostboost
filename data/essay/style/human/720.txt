The big problems and hard times of World War II were very big. The U.S. had to face really tough goals that would decide what happens next for America and Europe. It was super important for the U.S. to say no to communism growing in Europe and Asia, so they made special plans to stop this, and looking at how well they worked can teach us a lot.

First, let's talk about the plan of containment that the U.S. and its friends followed. The idea of this plan was to stop communism from spreading and react to the Soviet Union trying to get more power in many countries by giving money to those countries that were having a hard time (Corbett et al., 2014). We can say that this plan worked because the U.S. helped some countries not become communist.

The second successful plan was the Marshall Plan that aimed for many good changes. The main thought behind this plan was to give money to European countries that were struggling, giving them $13 billion to help their economy (Corbett et al., 2014). The countries that got help were able to come together and stop communism from becoming more popular. The third somewhat successful change was the Vietnam war (“Domino theory,” 2018). In this fight, South Vietnam and the U.S. fought against North Vietnam’s communist government (Corbett et al., 2014). Even though the U.S. couldn't save South Vietnam from the communist side, they were able to stop communism from spreading to the rest of Southeast Asia, so we can say this change was good. Lastly, someone might say that the United States didn't need to be scared of communism taking over during the Cold War time. The reason is that America was strong enough to fight against communism, and being scared could have made the country less sure of itself.
