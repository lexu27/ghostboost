With blood clot in leg veins, blood clots form and block blood flow. They can move to heart, lungs, or other organs. Sometimes hard to see first signs of leg vein blood clot. If skin changes color and swelling where clot is, it means vein problem.

As blood clot gets worse, legs hurt a lot. This happens because blood flow is stuck below clot. Blood clotting and vein damage cause this problem. Long trips and old age make it worse. Maybe patient takes meds making blood clotting worse, so ask to be sure.

To know problem, use scans, X-rays, MRI, or CT. These tests show how bad it is. Doctor gives right treatment after. Heparin shots and blood thinning pills can help. If not, need thrombolysis to dissolve clots. In worst case, need surgery, but try other ways first. Surgery can be risky for older patients. So, try other ways to avoid bad outcomes. This not only cures clot but also saves life.
