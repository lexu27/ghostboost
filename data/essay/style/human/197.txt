To stop sicknesses like heart problem, cancer, and sugar sickness, people must follow strict plans, especially about what they eat. According to American Heart Association, to avoid heart problem, people should eat food without extra sugars, lots of salt, or bad fats like trans fats (“Basic Foods”). People also need to eat whole grains, veggies like frozen or canned ones, nuts, seeds, and meats like chicken and lean beef. The American Cancer Society says it's good to eat more fruits and veggies, especially green and orange ones, because they help stop cancer (“American Cancer Society”). They also suggest eating foods with lots of fiber, like beans and whole grains, and not eating too much red meat or extra sugar. The American Diabetes Association suggests eating more veggies that aren't starchy, like broccoli, carrots, and cauliflower, which should be half of each meal (“Eat Well”). They also say it's important to eat foods with protein, like beans, hummus, and lentils, and fats like those in fruits and nuts. 
The tips to stop these sicknesses are mostly the same. All groups say it's important to avoid extra sugar and bad fats. Also, people trying to avoid heart problem, cancer, and sugar sickness should eat more fruits, veggies, and chicken. But, it’s better not to eat red meat if you have cancer, while it's okay for people with sugar sickness and heart problem. People with sugar sickness should eat more veggies that aren't starchy than other people. Also, to avoid heart problem, people should be careful about eating any kind of fats.
