Although Monster not good because he kill people, he also have good things. Monster look ugly and strong but not know many things. At first, Frankenstein’s creature is big and look bad, which make me know it is bad. Even though he look scary, he not want to hurt people. Monster like baby who want to know world and not understand why world so bad. Monster not really bad, he just want love and attention that world not give. Monster feel emotions, so he can know how people feel.
Book have scary things like ghosts, old buildings, and human spirit. Other scary things in book are want to know, Monster, and men becoming bad. I like this book because I like to see different things from different views. This book show me why Victor Frankenstein and Monster do things and how they feel. I also like books that show how society is bad using different symbols, like Monster.
Mary Shelley’s husband think bad social relations make people bad. If society not like people, they feel bad and become bad. I agree because people act based on how they treated. If people think they are bad, they have no reason to be good.
I think big idea in book is being alone. Monster want to be with people, but they hate him. This make him bad because he feel alone. Today, society ignore people who think differently. This make people feel lost and alone.
