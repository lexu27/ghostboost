Guaman Poma saw bad things done by the colonial government and he also had bad things happen to him. He came from Incan noble family and grew up after Peru was taken by Spanish. His family lost their lands and titles, and he tried to get them back but the government said no many times. At first, Poma helped the colonialists, but then he got sent away for saying he was noble when he wasn't and then he told everyone about how badly the Spanish treated the native people. He made a big book with pictures, 1200 pages long, for the Spanish king, where he talked about how life was before the Spanish came and how they hurt the Andean people after they got there.

Poma's book shows how bad colonialism was and says the Spanish had no right to take the land that God gave to the Peruvians. He said the government should be for the people and help them with their needs. Poma talked about freedom, representation in government, being responsible in society, and countries deciding for themselves. He said the government should be made by the people who lived there for a long time, which is a new idea.

Also, Poma's work says it's not true that Europeans made the Incas civilized. It shows that this idea was just an excuse to do violence, take resources, and erase the native culture to control them. Poma shows how a whole way of life was gone forever when the people lost their freedom and had to be like the Spanish. He likes that the Spanish say they have high morals, but he shows they don't really follow them.
