Ethnicity, culture, and religion are very important for how each person acts. These things sometimes make people argue. I think talking about race and culture is good. I have met racism since I was seven. My parents are from different places in Yemen, and they would talk about whose culture is better. Moving to Qatar, people said bad things about where I am from. In the USA, people were mean about my religion. These things helped me learn and like my culture, religion, and ethnicity more.
When people say bad things about me, I talk to them. I do not get mad because they do not know better. I try to teach them about me and where I am from. I am good at these talks and like having them. People often change their minds and say sorry.
