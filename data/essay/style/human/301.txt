Health promoters are people trained to help make people healthier. They do many things to make health better through groups that work on health. Their main goals are to help people feel strong on their own, make sure societies take care of health, and make places where people can learn and do things to be healthier and help their community (Nutbeam, 2019). In health promotion, different health workers from many areas agree to work together well and use many skills.
Teams that work together in health care try to bring together many different ideas about taking care of people and use the knowledge and skills of many different people and groups. Working together between different health workers and the public and businesses is very important to help people be healthier (US Department of Health and Human Services, 2018). Having many different parts shows that being healthy doesn't just come from doctors or nurses (Nutbeam, 2019). Many different activities in health promotion need different skills from many health workers and areas.
Having different experts in health promotion teams, like Nurse Practitioners (NPs), Social Workers (SWs), and Registered Nurses (RNs), will be helpful in the long and short term. Nurse practitioners are nurses who learn more and can help with many sicknesses and teach people how to stay healthy (Pun, 2018). Social workers have special training to help people and groups learn new skills and solve problems. Social workers can help with many kinds of problems, whether they are personal, between people, or in society (Nutbeam, 2019). Registered nurses look at what healthcare people need to choose the best care, the best healthcare worker, and the best tools to help patients (Pun, 2018). So, their skills and way of working will be important for the success of a team working together on health promotion.
