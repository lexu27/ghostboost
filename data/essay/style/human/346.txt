Person need talk to other person for life. Talk start with mouth, then paper. To speak well with someone, need know speech rules. Public speaker must talk nice, make good sentences, and connect with people. Reading from paper not good, need use words and body to speak well. This study look at body signals when Martin Luther King and Alicia Garza talk. Both good at using body to talk and get people's attention.

King talk about rights and end racism in USA. He want equality for all. Garza also talk about equality and being nice to black people. She say no racism in society, fight against it.

Both speeches similar about fighting racism and being fair to black people. They talk about being equal and kind to everyone. They use body language like gestures and face expressions. They also know how to use voice well and make pauses when talk. But King and Garza have different ways of speaking.

King speak with strong voice and passion. His speech full of strong words and repeats. People can't stop listening to him. Garza talk calmly and balanced. She not try hard to convince people, just tell facts. King use metaphors and repeat words to make speech memorable.

Place of speech also important. King speak at Lincoln Memorial in Washington, special place for Americans. Garza speak not at special place, so speech not as memorable. Audience also matter. King's audience understand and support him. Garza's audience also know topics well, so they listen carefully.
