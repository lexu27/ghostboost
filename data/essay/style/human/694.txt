The study by Jae Park looks at Blockchain in education. It says that Blockchain can be a big technology in society and data. The study shows that the Internet will change how things are owned and stored. A big study on Blockchain in industry and finance can help with crypto education, managing money, and more.

The study's aim is to see what tasks and problems Blockchain has. Blockchain was made for digital papers in 1991. Since 2009, it's used for money online and is very useful (Park, 2021). Blockchain's main use is to stop identity theft and keep information safe. It uses strong codes to keep info safe. The study also talks about how Blockchain helps with copyrights and education. Even though Blockchain is good, not many know how to use it. Other studies, like Delgado-von-Eitzen et al. (2021), show there's a need for more teaching about Blockchain. Learning about tech needs money, focus, and rules, which are not a priority now.

Blockchain can help society and the public. Teaching Blockchain can be part of school for jobs in government (Bartolom√© et al., 2017). Park's study says the main goal now is to make good programs about tech that focus on working together and being responsible.
