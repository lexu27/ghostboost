The city's culture is all about having fun and partying. People like to drink alcohol and use drugs there, which can be a problem for everyone, including young people. In 2020, a new law allowed people to drink alcohol in public in some parts of the city, which could make the issue worse.

But there is help available for those who need it, like Alcoholics Anonymous and hospitals for emergencies, including mental health services.
