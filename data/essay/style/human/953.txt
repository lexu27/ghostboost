Departing from usual ways may bring lots of good changes. Rules from society tell us what to do and how to act in different situations. When you don't follow the rules, it's called disobedience. Society, like the media, often shows black people as sad, so when they are happy, it seems strange. Sharing black joy might seem like going against the usual rules, but it can make things better for everyone in America. Adam also had to disobey God to become human from something else. So, not following social rules can lead to many good changes for people.
