Students, moms, dads, and teachers have lots of work in schools now. This makes it hard for schools to make good relationships with the people they help. Things like too much information and needing to do many things at once affect students, teachers, and parents (Zarra, 2013). For students, this means feeling a lot of stress from school and parents to remember many things, do well on tests, and do different things to do well (Zarra, 2013). Teachers also need to learn new tech things besides teaching and dealing with families. Parents today find it tough to help kids with school stuff as they have lots to do at work and home. Also, online learning makes parents have more to do, like watching how kids learn.

Schools make good relationships with students and parents with schedules and culture. Teachers use time well so students donâ€™t get too much work (Zarra, 2013). Students can do fun stuff after school and be with family. This helps teachers be nice to students and work with parents better. Teachers knowing they have a big role after class is key for being trusted (Zarra, 2013). When schools have a good vibe, students and parents are more likely to work together. Teachers being responsible to the community can make people trust the school more and talk about how to help students do better in school.
