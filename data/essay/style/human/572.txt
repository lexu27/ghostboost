Social media like TikTok shows videos you like. I watched a lot of ice-skating videos, so now many ice-skating videos show up. When I don't watch them, they show up less. The same happens on Instagram and YouTube. They show ads based on what I searched on Google. Sometimes, they show ads for things I talked about. This can be good because we see things we like. But, some people might find it scary if their devices listen to them. Trust might go down.
