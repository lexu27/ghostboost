Deductive reasoning is when you make connections between things to see how they affect each other. You need to have facts or ideas that lead to a decision. In logic, your argument is good only if the facts lead to the right decision. There are different types of these, and a good one doesn't always need true facts, just ones that would make the decision right if they were true. A good argument needs to have the right structure and true facts. It can still be wrong if the facts are wrong. What matters is that the decision logically follows from the facts you have. Even if everything is wrong, the argument can still be good if it makes sense. The goal of arguing is to find the truth. If the argument doesn't do this, then it's not a good one. A good argument is one with the right structure and true facts. If it's not good, then it doesn't matter what you believe, only the decision matters. So, in this case, there's no good argument.
