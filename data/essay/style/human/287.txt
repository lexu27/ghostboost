Gnomial Functions Inc. want to find best way to guess how much they will sell in next eighteen months. The sales have been going up steadily for the last 18 months with not much change in seasons. But sales from last few months seem to affect the sales for the next months more (Wisniewski, 2016). So, Gnomial Functions Inc. should use weighted moving average to guess the sales best.

The weighted moving average uses four different weights to guess how much they will sell next month. These weights go from 0.1 to 0.4 for the oldest and newest months. The newest data gets higher weight because it is more important for guessing the future sales. So, the weighted moving average gives better guesses than the simple moving averages.

The company can make even better guesses by changing the weights for the moving average. The managers should give more weight to the sales from recent months to make fewer mistakes in guessing. The mean absolute mistake and mean standard mistake for the first weights (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4) were 6.27 and 47.29. But when they use the new weights that focus more on the recent sales (0, 0, 0.4, and 0.6), the mean absolute mistake goes down to 4.81, and the mean standard mistake goes down to 27.28. This way of guessing is better than the simple moving average.

Gnomial Functions Inc. should use the weighted moving average to guess how much they will sell in the next year. This way is simple, works well, and can be changed to match the changes in sales by adjusting the weights to give more importance to recent months. So, the company should use the weighted moving average to guess how they will do in the next year.
