Leadership is very important in nursing. It is taught in schools and used in real work. Solving problems in a hospital helps to convince others to act. At East Orange General Hospital, we are working on a problem where poor people do not see their doctor again. We need to make plans and strategies to help them. This study looks at how to manage projects and lead well to help these patients.
The issue of poor patients missing appointments is a big problem for our hospital. It affects the quality of care and costs money. We need to work together – doctors, nurses, and managers – to fix this. We have to plan and try different leadership styles to help everyone. We need to set specific goals and use what works best.
We need to focus on helping these patients change their habits. By talking to them and giving them information, we hope they will come back to see the doctor. Different leaders will work with different people to make this happen. It is important for everyone to work together.
To help these patients, we need to teach them why it is important to come back to the hospital. Nurses and doctors can talk to them about their health and the costs of not coming back. The hospital can also send more reminders to patients.
There are challenges like hospital rules changing because of COVID-19. We need to be ready to adjust our plans. A good leader can help everyone work together and find solutions. My supervisor is helping with this.
Success depends on teamwork, overcoming challenges, and doing things well. If there are lockdowns or other problems, we need to change our plans quickly. Different leaders will help in different ways to reach the patients. Good leaders listen, give tasks, and make decisions based on facts.
It is important to solve the problem of patients not coming back to the hospital. We need to use good management and leadership to help them.
