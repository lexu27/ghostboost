Social media is very important in today's world because many people like to talk to others using these websites. Me, I like Facebook more because it doesn't have as much ads and spam as Instagram or Tik Tok. I use Facebook to talk to my old friends who I can't see anymore because they moved away. This way I can still talk to them sometimes. But social media can be bad because it shows a lot of hate and fake things. People try to look better on social media to impress others. This can make people feel bad about themselves when they see others looking perfect on social media. People also don't want to be friends with others who don't help them. This shows that social media is not good for people's mental health and confidence.
There are many social media apps for different things. For example, Tik Tok is for fun videos with friends, and Twitter is for sharing opinions with others. This means people talk differently on each app. Also, some apps are only for texting while others are for video calls or voice messages.
