COVID-19 stopping and vaccine sharing talked a lot last year. America got hit hard, needing good ways to fight the virus. Many smart people think the government should get more tests and vaccines. Biden sees the virus issue but says each state is important, "No federal answer. States must fix it" (Franck, 2021, para. 5). This means the government can't stop the virus alone; states and people need to help. Vaccines work well to help with symptoms (WHO, 2022). So, only the government can't do much; people need to know COVID-19 is dangerous and vaccines help.
About Biden talking on the virus in late 2021, I kind of agree. The Omicron virus found in November 2021 spreads fast (WHO, 2021). This caused more people to get sick, needing more tests (UC Davis Health, 2022). We need to learn more about Omicron; it was a surprise. But in 2022, we are ready, and Biden will get 500 million tests (BBC News, 2021). We all need to work together to stop Omicron.
