The now money sharing in the U.S. not fair. One job I think not paid enough is the nurse in hospitals. From what my friends who work there tell me, nurses do lots for patients but not get enough money. One job I think get too much money is the football player in the big leagues. More and more people watch football now because it easy with new technology, so footballers get lots of money.

I choose these examples because pay should match how important the work is for society. This idea from utilitarianism which says we should do things that make lots of people happy. Nurses help sick people and save lives, while football players just play games for fun. If there were no nurses, sick people in hospitals could get worse or even die because no one looking after them. But if there were no football players, people would just watch other sports.

To make things fair, we could try to make rules to lower footballers' pay or make them pay more taxes. Big sports teams could be made to give some money to charity. This way, they would have to pay players less. We could also ask for laws to make sure nurses get paid more. If nurses get paid more, they might work better because they want to do a good job and help more people.
