The first thing in nursing research is when Florence Nightingale did a study. She used her big knowledge to make taking care of sick family members better. In the United States, nursing research is now more important. They made the National Institute for Nursing Research and gave more money for research. In hospitals, nurses now have jobs that involve research.
In places like Great Britain, Germany, France, and Switzerland, they are recognizing nursing as its own job with theory. There are three main differences between research-based and evidence-based practices. First, the first one is more practical. Second, the results are tested in different places. Last, the methods and results are better.
Bharat Aggarwal, a professor, stopped working after finding mistakes in his cancer research. Many of his papers were taken back. This is bad and shouldn't happen, especially in healthcare. To prevent this, researchers need to make sure their studies are good by getting approval. If I did research, I would protect the participants and get approval from the healthcare people.
