Epithelial tissue is made of cells that are put together in sheets, with cells being very close to each other. The layers of epithelia don't have blood vessels but have nerves inside. The cells in the epithelium have two sides that can be different in their form and job. Some glands, like the exocrine and endocrine, are made of epithelial tissue and are sorted by how they release their secretions. There are eight kinds of epithelia, where six are named by the number and shape of cells and two by the type of cells in them. They are called simple squamous, simple cuboidal, simple columnar, pseudostratified columnar, stratified squamous, stratified cuboidal, stratified columnar, and transitional epithelium. Among these, we'll talk more about the simple squamous epithelium.

Simple squamous epithelium is a single layer of flat cells that look like scales. This type of epithelium lines the insides of blood vessels, makes up the walls of sacs in the lungs, and lines body cavities. The cells are flat and arranged in one layer. It's thin enough to allow the movement of compounds through diffusion. Simple squamous epithelia help with gas exchange and small molecule transport.

Simple squamous epithelium is permeable and is found where small molecules need to move quickly through membranes by diffusion or filtration. It's known for exchanging molecules fast across tissues. To allow this, some types of simple squamous epithelium have pores to let molecules go through, making it a leaky epithelium. It's mostly found in the lungs, heart linings, lymphatic vessels, and blood vessels. Its main job is to help materials pass through by diffusion and filtration and produce lubricants.

Since it's part of the lungs, heart, blood, and lymphatic vessels, simple squamous epithelium is vital for the body. Lungs are important for breathing, letting oxygen in and carbon dioxide out during respiration. The heart pumps blood around the body, providing it with oxygen, nutrients, and removing waste.

Blood and lymphatic vessels are also crucial, with simple squamous epithelium being a key part. The lymphatic system helps the immune system, balances body fluids, and absorbs fats and nutrients. Blood vessels deliver blood to organs and tissues, supplying them with oxygen and nutrients.

The image of simple squamous epithelium is seen in a longitudinal section, showing a cut along the long axis of the structure. This section helps see every cell touching the basement membrane. In contrast, a stratified epithelium shows some cells resting on others without touching the basement membrane.

Looking at simple epithelial cells usually requires a biopsy. A sample is fixed, embedded in paraffin, cut, and stained for examination. Keratin can help identify epithelial cells and their types. Light microscopy is used to visualize and study the tissue's structure.
