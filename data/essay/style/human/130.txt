Physical check of skin areas needed. People with cellulitis may have red skin parts, swelling, and big pain (Brown & Watson, 2022). Brant hurts in his right leg, where skin is red and big.
Affected area must be checked well for skin breaking signs. Temperature changes in area should be watched and abscess signs too (Sutherland & Parent, 2017). Brant said he got bit by a mosquito on red skin part.
As this seems very bad, doctor might ask for blood test (CBC). It will help measure blood levels (Bennett et al., 2020). CBC will help doctor diagnose many conditions early.
Doctor may also ask for CRP test, a blood test for swelling. It's needed as Brant has broken skin from mosquito bite (Sutherland & Parent, 2017). Brant’s case is major issue with chills and confusion.
Main checks for Brant are redness in skin layers and skin below. Red, big, and painful are all cellulitis signs (Sutherland & Parent, 2017). Redness must be there for diagnosis.
Where and how skin broke should be checked too. For cellulitis diagnosis, skin must be checked for small skin breaks from bug bites (Brown & Watson, 2022). Legs are usually affected.
Brant’s position and movement need change. To lessen swelling, Brant’s feet and arms should be up on pillows while he lies down (Zariquiey-Esteva & Santa-Candela, 2017). Standing long may slow blood flow to heart, causing low blood pressure.
Brant might need to lie on side when sick or vomiting. He feels sick and weak, and has vomited many times (Zariquiey-Esteva & Santa-Candela, 2017). This helps prevent low blood pressure.
When germs go through skin, “cytokines” and “neutrophils” go in blood to fight. This causes cellulitis with redness, warmth, swelling, and pain (Brown & Watson, 2022, para 5). This seems to be Brant’s case. Mosquito bite broke skin, letting bacteria in. Redness and swelling came when “cytokines and neutrophils” fought bacteria (Brown & Watson, 2022, para 5).
