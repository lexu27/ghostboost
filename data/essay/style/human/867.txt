The story in the movie Carol is special because it looks closely at different parts of the story. The reason it is different from usual stories is because Carol shows many views. It does not just talk about Carol or Therese, but it moves gently from one part of the story to another. Both views mix together to make a strong and interesting story full of details, feelings, and story parts.

Firstly, it is important to know that the movie happens in the 1950s, when things were very traditional and strict, especially for LGBTQ+ people. But, it is the mix of modern and classic in the story that is important (Turan par. 4). This means that using many viewpoints along with old-fashioned style makes the story special. The movie is made so that viewers mostly watch the characters, who show their feelings not by talking but by their faces, where they are, how they stand, and the music in the background. Another review says viewers see "the characters through windows of a car or house and they are not clear" (Raynes par. 8). Sometimes, viewers see the main characters behind windows, like in real life when people see strangers and not private talks.

Secondly, the story is different because it pays close attention to the details. A reviewer talks about something Haynes said, he wanted a unique story and said: “I felt like if we followed a genre very closely, but did it with dolls, and did it very carefully and very lovingly and attentively, it could stimulate emotions in a viewer the way it would if it was actors” (Barr par. 2). This means the story moves from one character to another slowly without clear changes. So, the movie focuses a lot on how characters show things without talking to keep things real.

But, the feelings and main parts of the characters’ talks are shown through looking, smiling, and other expressions. In this kind of story, the job of deciding is not for the director, producer, or writer, but for the viewers, not just one person but everyone watching. If the viewers like what they see, and feel something, then the filmmaker did a good job. So, in Carol’s story, the meaning and important parts are shown by following the main characters.

To finish, the movie's story is different from usual ones because it uses many views to see and follow the main characters. The changes from one part of the story to another are smooth, making one strong story. The movie does not tell too much but shows things naturally without being too nosy from the viewer's side.
