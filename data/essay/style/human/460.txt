The Balboa is money in Panama. It is called after a Spanish explorer, Vasco Nez de Balboa, who saw the big water, the Pacific Ocean. One Balboa is the same as one U.S. Dollar, and folks in Panama have been changing their money for U.S. Dollars for a long time. This makes Panama a country with lots of money going up all the time. Even so, Panama can get good things from the U.S. Dollar being strong and used a lot in the big world money places. This means Panama won't have very high prices going up crazy because of money exchange moving around. So, Panama is now a better place for people to put money in or visit. But, using U.S. money helps Panama not have too much money going crazy, and it can stop problems when not a lot of folks trust money happening worldwide, but not real problems coming from outside (Bakari & Mabrouki, 2017). Also, people are not sure if Panama having a lot of money around came from using U.S. money or because of banks everywhere in the big world.

Panama's place on the map as a big way for ships is important for the Agreement. About two-thirds of the ships that go through the Panama Canal every year go to or come from places in the U.S. (Park et al., 2020). Most cars and things companies send to Panama from the U.S. won't need to pay taxes first, and any taxes left will go away in ten years (Park et al., 2020). Lots of things like tech gear, farming stuff, big machines, planes and parts, health stuff, things for the environment, plants, medicine, fertilizer, and farm chemicals from the U.S. will not have taxes right away. Panama and the U.S. trade things like corn and bananas when they talk about selling things to each other.
