In poem by Emily Dickinson called “Hope Is the Thing with Feathers,” we see how much author feels deeply. When she wrote, there was a big fight in America between the rich North and the South with slaves. Emily Dickinson lived in a quiet place called Amherst, and even there they felt sad for their sons who died. This sad thing also affected Emily Dickinson’s writing, and you can see it in the poem “Hope Is the Thing with Feathers.”

The poem mostly uses the sound “i” and some other sounds like “s,” “l,” “m.” The sound “i” is like blue, green – colors that mean light, happiness, peace: “I’ve heard it in the chilliest land” (Dickinson 1). The words with the sound “s” are about storms and dark things: “sore must be the storm” (Dickinson 1). So, in the poem, it’s like a fight between light and dark colors. This fight shows the struggle between the North and the South.

The poem’s words go up and down. Some words talk about hoping for the end of slavery (“Hope,” “And sweetest”) (Dickinson 1). The poem ends with a strong feeling: the words “of Me” sound very emotional (Dickinson 1). The words going up and down show the feelings of the person in the poem. This up and down feeling shows the struggle against slavery.

The important words in the poem are: hope, soul, gale, storm, bird, extremity. These words show how hope fights with the world around it (Dickinson 1). In this poem, hope is like a bird:
“Hope” is the thing with feathers / That perches in the soul (Dickinson 1).
A bird is a sign of freedom. By giving hope wings, the author shows how important the fight between the North and the South is for everyone’s freedom.

The verbs talking about hope are in the present tense, showing that hope never stops (“perches,” “sings,” “never stops”) (Dickinson 1). Since the fight between slavery and freedom has been happening for a long time, the word “never” shows that the fight keeps going. The word “hope” becomes strong in the poem, showing the constant fight. The poem also talks about space and natural things like “gale,” “storm,” “strangest sea,” “extremity” (Dickinson 1). These words show danger, worry, and pain. The poem creates a feeling of a scary world, and this feeling is shared by the person in the poem. This shows how tense the time when America was divided into two parts was.

So, “Hope Is the Thing with Feathers” is an important poem because the image of hope as a small bird shows how many Americans felt during a hard time. Emily Dickinson showed how people felt during the fight between the North and the South.
