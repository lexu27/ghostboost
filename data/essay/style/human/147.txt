Elephants dance, lions play, bears cycle, tiger jumps through fire ring - all are fun to watch, especially for kids. However, some people worry about animals in circuses, saying it's not right to make them do tricks. They believe it's mean and not fair to animals. They want to stop circuses from using animals because it's not nice and goes against their rights. 

Since the 1970s, many countries have made laws to protect animals. They agreed that animals have feelings and need to be treated well. The tricks animals learn in circuses are not natural for them. They are forced to do them by not giving them food until they do as told. Animals should act like their own kind, but circuses make them act differently.

People usually think animals in circuses are happy like actors, but that's not true. Animals don't choose to perform, they lose their freedom and spend most of their time in small cages where they can't move freely. They suffer a lot, but they can't change their situation because people are stronger and use them for shows.

It's important to stop using animals in circuses. Animals should live freely in their own habitat. Everyone should understand and protect animal rights. We should not support shows that harm animals.
