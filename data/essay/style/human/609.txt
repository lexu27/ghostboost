Robert Williams, he ran away from a mental hospital and lived in the Des Moines YMCA. A young girl, 10 years old, was reported missing during a wrestling match at the YMCA. Williams was thought to be the person who took the young girl after a boy said he saw him at the YMCA putting many clothes in his car on the same day the girl vanished. Williams gave himself up and said he would tell everything only when his lawyer was there in Des Moines. The officer who took him to Des Moines knew he was very religious and told Williams that the girl should have a "Christian burial." Williams said things that made the police find the body of the young girl. Williams was accused of first-degree murder and put in jail.

Did they stop the defendant from having a lawyer as said in the sixth amendment?
Yes, the defendant was not allowed to have a lawyer during the legal process. The defendant was questioned when the investigator spoke to Williams without his lawyer there (Brewer v. Williams, 1977). The defendant was not well mentally and the police made him say things that made him look guilty. The proof was gathered and showed in the trial even though the defendant's right to have a lawyer was broken.

The case was solved at the Supreme Court with a 5-4 vote and most people said that the trial started without the defendant's lawyer, breaking the Sixth Amendment (Brewer v. Williams, 1977). The Supreme Court also thought that the officer who talked about the "Christian burial" did it on purpose to break Williams' rights. This is because the officer wrote a promise to not talk to the suspect before he met with his lawyer. Robert William was found not guilty because the proof used against him was shown in the wrong way in court.
