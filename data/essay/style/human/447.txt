Young people like to change many things in life quickly. They make choices, find chances, offer new ideas, and follow dreams. This is happening to me. I want to join a program at this school. Nursing is not just a job I want to learn, but a subject that will help me a lot. The issue of health is very serious now. People need extra help with diseases, health problems, pandemics, and body issues. I am taking a big step by applying to this program. I choose nursing and health science to learn skills and knowledge to help people. Nursing is important from many views. Some want to make it better, but some think it's hard. Nursing can be tough with sadness, surprises, and wanting new things. But new ways help nurses handle these and stop bad feelings. Nurses are key to helping people stay healthy. I want to be part of this and value professional talks.
I know that applying to school needs skills and proof that I can learn and help others. I am not very experienced in nursing at 22, but I am ready to study and understand all I am taught. I learn fast, which is crucial in health care. Nursing is always changing, so I must read a lot, join talks, and talk with others. I am good at talking and working with others.
I need to focus on being a good nurse, not just treating people, but helping them stay healthy. People often don't know much about health care. My help is important, so I want to learn a lot about nursing to be the best.
I think nursing is the right job for me. I am moving from California to Ohio for this. It is hard to change, but I feel strongly about this. I want to help others, and this program is good for me.
