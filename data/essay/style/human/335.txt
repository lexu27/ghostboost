IKEA is very good at selling things all around the world because they do all parts of the marketing mix well. They change their plan for each place they sell in very carefully and with a lot of ideas, making their things very known. This can show other companies in Europe and everywhere how to sell their things better. This paper will talk about the four parts of IKEA’s marketing mix. 

This company from Sweden is very famous for making good things that are easy to get, new, and cool. First, they focus on making their prices low by planning their stores in a way that makes things cheaper. They tell lots of people about their stores through different ways, like local radio and social media. They also use famous people to talk about their things to young people. They always choose places for their stores where people can go easily and still keep prices low. But the best thing about IKEA is their things. Their furniture is easy to know because of how it looks, how you can change it, and how you can use it again. They always have new things in their stores, so people keep going back.

They have a piece of furniture for everyone and every style because their things can change in many ways. IKEA’s wish to give people what they want has helped them a lot in Europe and everywhere.
