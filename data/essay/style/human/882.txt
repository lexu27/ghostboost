The process of new kids and their parents getting used to school can be hard for them and the teacher. A teacher can use many ways to help the kids and parents. I think talking a lot with parents through meetings or calls, while thinking about their time and privacy, is very important. Doing activities at home and letting parents come to class is also important.
Many parents want to be part of or know about how their kids are doing in a new class. Making parents trust you by talking well with them and working together to solve problems would help kids and parents. Being careful about their time and privacy is important to have a good relationship with parents. Doing activities at home can help kids do better in school. Telling parents about how important these activities are would make them join in, which would help kids adjust. When parents and kids feel anxious about being apart, a teacher can ask parents to come to class. But it's important to explain to parents what's expected before to avoid confusion. This would calm the kids and reassure parents about their kids' safety.
Adapting to a new school and teacher is hard for kids and parents, but there are ways to make it better for everyone. I think being nice and talking with parents is the most important thing when starting at a new school. Having parents come to class can help with the worries of being apart. Also, doing activities at home would help kids get more involved.
