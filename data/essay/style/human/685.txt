The Hippocratic Oath was made long ago in the past, in the fifth century B.C. It is one of the oldest things written in history. The people who wrote it wanted it to be a serious promise. Doctors nowadays see it as a vow to protect the art of medicine and help the patient in the best way. The medical world has changed the oath over time to match how healthcare and society change. Dr. Louis Lasagna wrote one version of the oath in 1948.

The biggest difference between the old oath and the new one is about who the oath is for. In the old oath, they talk about Apollo and other Greek gods of medicine. Today, the oaths are made to anything sacred or just start with a promise to keep medical ideals. Dr. Louis Lasagna says one important thing, “I will not be ashamed to say “I know not.” It is important to know that no one can know everything, but there is always a chance to get better.

Also, in the old oath, doctors are seen as just doing their job. They promise not to be tempted by their patients, whether they are free or slaves, which seems wrong. In the new version, doctors are seen as part of society who not only do their job but also respect their patients.

So, the Hippocratic Oath thinks about what the patient needs, but it was made for the time it was written. Dr. Louis Lasagna's oath fits better with what I believe in. I think about what the patient needs first and think it's important to be kind and show respect while working. I also think it's important not to be embarrassed about not knowing something, as it can push us to learn new things.
