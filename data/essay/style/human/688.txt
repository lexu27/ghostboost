The coming of information society has made many chances to look again at the current sociocultural, socioeconomic, and sociopolitical issues. The problem of unfairness in the modern community is a big worry around the world. Groups that work to fix unfairness are trying hard to deal with this problem. The World Summit on Information Society thinks that we need to understand the post-colonial situation well to make fair rules.
Aginam talks about how we need the help of WSIS to deal with unfairness. By focusing on the economy that goes beyond cultures and getting more people from around the world involved in trading, we can start to fix some of the unfairness. By making partnerships and growing businesses with foreign groups, we can work on making things fairer and give a voice to those hurt by colonialism.
Helping smaller countries in the post-colonial economy with the support of WSIS and other groups seems like a good idea. But we must make sure that everyone acts with ethics and respects diversity by using control tools. To do this, we need to create a way for post-colonial communities to communicate globally.
