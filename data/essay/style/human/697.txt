Storytelling
Many boss and those who want to be boss have heard about important boss qualities. Often, these skills involve different things like talking well, understanding feelings, being professional, feeling sure, and being good. But not all boss think about the strong tool of telling stories. People look at the world from their side for most of their life. One side will not show everything that is happening. When someone hears someone else's story, he feels this different side, built on different beliefs, on a different life (Snyder et al., 2017). In this case, if a person feels the story, he feels a new side and changes his beliefs. In the hands of boss, this tool can change the way their students think for good results.

To change old bad thoughts, a boss must do more than just tell his own story. Every boss's story has a problem, a structure that people understand, and a hidden lesson that tells people what to do. Today we will talk about how boss stories can be a main tool for boss things and why everyone wins.

Good things
Stories are easy to remember, make you feel good, and change boring information. Sometimes, telling stories is the only way to talk to people. Pictures, papers, messages do not have the feelings that people put into their stories. First, the boss shows he is human by telling stories, which can be a step towards trust for many workers. Second, stories are creative and a kind of art. The same story told by two people can sound very different. Also, this tool helps bring everyone together and show that everyone is important, no matter where they are from (Denning, 2017). Third, stories help you learn from mistakes. A story comes from outside, and only when someone tells it, its meaning comes out. A boss can tell the company's vision and mission through their stories, which helps get workers more involved. In big company changes, telling stories to new workers is very important, more important than money and time (Orr & Bennett, 2017). Finally, stories work when direct orders do not. People cannot be creative and follow strange rules until they know why. A boss's story is a very good thing in this case. In the end, a simple story helps build trust and friendships between boss and workers.

Important
Other ways to build trust between bosses and workers include these. The first way is talking openly and getting fair feedback. This is like the other side of telling stories because in a story, someone shares their feelings and beliefs, and with feedback, they listen to someone else's feelings and thoughts. This is important for a good atmosphere and work in any company. The second way is teaching company values and showing appreciation. This is based on company rules and what is important in society. Workers' values can also be shared through stories, new leadership ideas, or training (van Hulst, 2017). When these things happen, workers feel more involved and happy at work.
