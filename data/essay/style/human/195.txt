The healthcare people pay attention to patient's learning, especially for different groups. The writing by McCurley et al. (2017) gives good information. They show that Hispanic people do better with stopping diabetes when they go to meetings (McCurley et al., 2017). I think there is a clear reason for this success. It looks like meetings are good because patients can ask questions. Also, these meetings show that a patient is not alone with this health problem. This makes patients feel better and want to take care of themselves more.
This data makes me think that meetings can help in my project about helping African Americans with heart problems. But, we should not forget about the bigger picture and everyone's background. Cajiita et al. (2017) looked at how using phones for healthcare (mHealth) can help. They studied 129 older people, and 25% were African Americans (Cajiita et al., 2017). Phones can be as good as meetings because people use the internet a lot now. So, it makes sense to use phones to help African Americans. Also, maybe using both phones and meetings together can give the best results.
