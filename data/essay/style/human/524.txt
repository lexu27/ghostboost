Summary
The news and TV have big power in politics, society, and beliefs. They can control what people think about things and how they see the world. Because they are everywhere and for everyone, they can affect how each new group of people sees things. The more they grow, the harder it is to understand what's really going on in the world, especially about race.

How Mass News Affects Us
A lot of people watch the news, it's everywhere and comes through machines. It shows what's happening in society and tries to control how we act. Because it's for everyone, it can change how different groups think about race. Usually, the news uses the same old things and ideas. This can make people feel good or bad about others when they see them. The news sometimes doesn't show things from different sides, which can make us think about race in a small way and make us react in the wrong way.

So, the news can make us feel and think in different ways. On one side, it helps us learn about the world, including race, on a big scale. But on the other side, it can make us believe in things that are not true. This can create a wrong idea about race and how we see others. In the end, the way news spreads information is not as important as how it can change our thoughts and ideas about other races.
