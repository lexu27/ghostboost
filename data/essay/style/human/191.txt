Chronic pain is still big issue for 8% people in modern countries. Study says pain makes people sad. Pain makes people not enjoy life. Study looks at sadness and worry in people who take strong pain medicine. It looks at pills and medical marijuana. It checks if medicine helps or makes people sad after. 
There is not enough info on pain pills. They help pain, but can be bad if taken too much. Maybe medical marijuana is safer. But not many studies on it. Study wants to see if pills or marijuana make people less sad.
Study asks people questions and looks at the answers. People were asked questions for 6 months in Israel. They used tests to see if people were sad or worried. They checked if pills or marijuana helped more. 
This study is good because many people answered questions. Tests are good for getting info. They help to organize info for further use. Researchers can see how medicine affects people of different ages and backgrounds. 
It is hard to know if people tell truth when asked. Some may say they are sadder than they really are. Study did not know who said what. They could ask psychologists to talk to people, but it needs more time and money.
Many people in Israel were asked questions for 6 months. They all had pain for 3 months. Study had 890 people, most took pills, some took marijuana. Some took both. Few who did not take anything were not counted. So we can't compare all people.
Study looked at different things that affect people with pain. It found more women took pills. Women on pills were sadder. 
People answered many questions. They said their age, job, health history, and if they drink or do drugs. They also rated their pain level. 
Many people were sad and worried. Most sad people took pills. More people on pills felt anxious. People on strong pills rated their pain very high. People on marijuana were calmer and managed pain better.
Not many people answered questions, only 57%. Maybe because they feel better now. Stats still useful for study.
