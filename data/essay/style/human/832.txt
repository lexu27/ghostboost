The Relationship Between Kate Chopin's At The Cadian Ball and The Storm

The Storm seems like a story that comes after Kate Chopin's At The Cadian Ball. Both stories have the same main people: Bobinot, Calixta, Alcee, and Clarisse. Alcee and Calixta are together at Assumption, where the ball is. They play around until Clarisse comes and takes Alcee away, leaving Calixta alone at the balcony. Later, Bobinot finds her and proposes to her on their way home, and she says yes. On the other hand, Clarisse accepts Alcee's proposal, which she had said no to before.

The Storm tells us what happens after these two couples get married and what happens because they decided to marry quickly. The two ladies say yes to their partners because they are scared of losing them and being jealous of each other. The main things in The Storm are sex and marriages that don't work out. The name The Storm represents some of the characters' lives, and Calixta and Alcee end up marrying other people. So, the two stories are connected because one comes after the other.

The Idea of Social Status in At The Cadian Ball

The social class is important in deciding what the characters can do. Clarisse doesn't go to the Cadian Ball, and she gets upset when Alcee goes. Both Alcee and Clarisse are Creoles from the Spanish and French people who lived in Louisiana. In many of Kate Chopin's stories, Creoles are rich, owning a lot of land and doing business. Bobino and Calixta are Acadians from the French who were kicked out of their homes by the British in 1775. In most stories, the Acadians are poorer than the Creoles, working as fishers and farmers or serving the Creoles. Clarisse is a Creole, meaning she has a higher social status, which is why she doesn't go to the ball and wonders why Alcee does.

How At The Cadian Ball is About Love and Attraction

The author tries to show the difference between love, attraction, and desire. In this story, attraction is shown as flirting. At Assumption, where the Cadian ball is, Alcee takes Calixta to a private place and flirts with her until Clarisse comes and takes Alcee away. Kate Chopin also shows love through loyalty and devotion. At the ball, Bobinot looks for Calixta, finds her alone on the balcony, and offers to take her home. Bobinot's feelings and actions show love, even though Calixta doesn't pay attention to him. Bobinot stays excited and happy when Calixta notices him. The story captures love and attraction through how the characters act.

How the Author Talks About Feminism and Impropriety in This Story

This story happens in 1892 at the end of the Victorian era when people had to be very polite. Most rich people, especially women, were allowed to be a little rude but still polite. However, Calixta is different because she is carefree and sometimes rude. Like Kate Chopin's other stories in the early 20th century, At The Cadian Ball is about feminism with Calixta as a daring woman who doesn't follow the rules set by men. She is outgoing and doesn't listen to society's rules, but she still fits in. So, this story shows feminism and impropriety.

At The Cadian Ball Talks About Racial Discrimination

This story talks about social classes, where your family and ancestors decide where you belong. Bruce is a Creole servant who is treated badly in the story because he is African American. This puts him at the bottom of the social ladder in Louisiana. Just like Bruce, African Americans worked as servants for the rich after the war. So, this story shows how people were treated differently because of their race.

Is At The Cadian Ball a Story about New Women?

The Cadian Ball shows the cultural values of the Acadian and Creole societies in the 19th century. But back then, it was a society where men were in charge, and women's voices didn't matter much. Women couldn't talk about their needs, especially their sexual needs. They had to follow the rules and stick to traditional roles. Kate Chopin's story is about women wanting freedom from being controlled and dependent on men in a society that was run by men. Sadly, none of the women in the story get that freedom even though they try to get it.
