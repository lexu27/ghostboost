This paper will talk about the article "COVID-19: Impact on Nurses and Nursing" by Fauteux (2021). The abstract is like the beginning of the article. It quickly tells the reader what the research found. In this article, the abstract gives a short summary of what will be discussed. But, it doesn't say how the research was done or what they found. Because of this, we can't say the abstract is complete. The article's start is longer and gives a general idea about the topic. It says that the coronavirus time has affected nursing. Also, it gives numbers that show the reader how this affects nursing in a real way. From the start, I learned about the main things that COVID has changed in nursing, like more deaths, different ways of working, and more work to do. This start is detailed and enough. The way they did this research is called qualitative. It means they looked at a lot of research to make conclusions. These conclusions talk about the big changes in nursing because of COVID. They used numbers that were already checked and show a summary of info that others already looked at. The result of the research is finding the main changes in nursing. Some of these are working together more, finding new ways to work, using telemedicine more, and having more chance of being too tired (Fauteux, 2021). I learned how much COVID has changed nursing. I was most interested in how nurses can get too tired because of too much work. Also, I found out about how telemedicine is used more because of COVID, which surprised me because people now seem to care more about their health after the virus started. This article helps us see how a whole part of medicine can change a lot in hard times.
