Nursing is very important in hospitals. The theory of nursing helps nurses to do their job well in real life. But sometimes, nurses do things without knowing why. This can cause problems like not wanting to learn, losing trust, and not helping patients well. So, it's important to learn why nurses do what they do.

Nursing started a long time ago with Florence Nightingale. She helped soldiers during wars. Over time, nursing changed a lot. Now, nurses learn in school and have more duties. They follow safety rules to give good care.

Some important nurses are Florence Nightingale, Clara Barton, Mary Breckinridge, Dorothea Dix, Margaret Sanger, Mary Mahoney, Walt Whitman, Lillian Wald, Mary Seacole, and Virginia Avenel Henderson. They all did important things for nursing.

Trust between patients and nurses is very important. Patients need to trust nurses to get good care. But sometimes, patients don't trust nurses enough. We need to show patients how good nurses are to help them feel better.
