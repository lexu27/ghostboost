The article talked about why ladies choose not to have children. Reasons include wanting to do well in school and work, money concerns, not feeling like having kids, and thinking that kids might not improve life but make it harder. There were a few points I don't fully agree with. A lady deciding to be with a man who has a 15-year-old daughter but not wanting to help care for the child seems unkind to both the girl and the dad. Also, saying women don't feel pressured to have kids because of opportunities doesn't fit with the past when women without kids had fewer chances in society. 
From what I read, not having kids is a choice for anyone based on their goals. Some ladies are happy focusing on work and don't want kids unless they can give love and care. But many women still choose to have kids even with challenges like money or work. Since each woman is different and we can choose in today's world, having kids or not is a personal decision based on our experiences.
