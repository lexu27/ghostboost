Epithelial tissues are like skin covers inside the body for protecting from outside things. They can be anywhere in the body where a wall is needed, for things to go through. Because of the many epithelial tissues in the body, there are different kinds of sicknesses that affect them. It is important to know about these diseases to understand how they affect the tissues. Let's talk about eczema now, which is a common problem for epithelial tissue.

To explain easily, eczema, also called atopic dermatitis, is a sickness that makes the skin red and itchy. It can start when a person is young. Eczema can stay for a long time for many people and come and go now and then, usually because of things in the surroundings. Sadly, there is no cure to make eczema go away forever. But, there are ways to help with the itchiness and redness and stop new outbreaks for a short time. Good things to do for eczema are using gentle soaps, keeping the skin moist, and using special creams and ointments.

Knowing the signs of atopic dermatitis can help find them early and try to manage them as per a doctor's advice. The signs can be different from person to person but usually include dry skin, itching a lot, especially at night, red patches on the hands, feet, neck, and other areas. The skin with eczema can look thick, scaly, and cracked because of scratching, and it can get sore, swollen, and sensitive to many things. Also, there might be small bumps that leak fluid and form crusts when scratched.

Eczema often starts at five years old, with most cases happening between three and six months, but it can start at any age. About 60% get eczema in their first year of life, and 90% have it by five years old. Even though atopic dermatitis can affect people of different ages, it is less common in adults.

The seriousness of eczema and how it is managed can vary, but the pain and itchiness can make daily tasks hard for those with eczema. Also, because eczema doesn't look nice, some people may feel shy or embarrassed about it, which is sad. This is a problem because eczema can lower life quality and health. It's not just about the skin feeling sore and itchy; it also doesn't protect the body well, which is not good for overall health.
