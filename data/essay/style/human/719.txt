Panama is a country that is growing and has lots of money in Central America. It has a big number when talking about how much money it makes, but it also has problems with money inside the country, like some people having more money than others and being poor. This paper wants to talk about two news stories about Panama that show a big problem with many people not having a job, and this problem is getting worse and becoming a crisis.

The first news story is from a Panama news place called Newsroom Panama. It says that in 2021, 108,975 people in Panama were looking for a job, and more women could not find jobs compared to men (Newsroom Panama, 2022). People not having jobs is because there are not new jobs, so the government gives money to help them live (Newsroom Panama, 2022). This news story agrees with what I found that even though Panama is making money fast, more and more people are not able to find jobs.

The second news story was written in Valley Post and is called “Making Jobs is Hard for Panama.” It says that COVID-19 has affected jobs a lot in Panama, especially in places like tourism, stores, houses, and building things (Arzu, 2022). This news story agrees with what I found that most people in Panama work in services. When these main parts of the economy cannot work normally, more people lose their jobs.

To finish, Panama sells things to other countries and most of its money comes from services. Even though the country is getting bigger, people living there do not see this growth because many of them cannot find a good job. To fix this, the country has to make its workers better and make new jobs, like by building things.
