In my community, women like daughters, wives, or daughters-in-law usually help sick people with things like dressing, washing, and cooking. Men mostly give money for support. Many family members work together to help the sick person, not just one person. Different things like gender, marriage, and age decide who helps the sick person. Studies say women usually help more often than men. Men often work to get money while women help with daily things. If both partners are sick, the less sick one usually helps more. Younger people often help older relatives. In our community, family values and women's roles make caregiving easier. Religion also helps us feel better. To help our community, it's important to understand our values. Teaching about families as helpers can be helpful. It's important for social workers to know about our community's needs and stand up for our rights. They should also support fair treatment in policies and media.
