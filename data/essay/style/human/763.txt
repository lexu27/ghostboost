According to Lufkin (2021), it's very important to lessen the effect on physical and digital presenteeism during the pandemic and big changes. This paper talks about why it's crucial to understand the real reasons for presenteeism and how hidden biases affect relationships between employees. Also, being seen often and admired can lead to promotions that might not be fair or effective, which makes a difference in the work quality. The thought that many biases unreasonably support presenteeism and harm performance is correct, and it's strange to judge employees' achievements based on favors.

Presenteeism is a problem because most people keep following their hidden beliefs about growing in their job. Lufkin (2021) notices that not everyone can always come early and leave late to show how much they care about the company. Some people choose priorities over finding a balance between work and life as an employee and a parent. They think that being at work helps them move up or get rewards, but the pandemic has shown that working from home can also be good. These attitudes about presenteeism make people lose interest and put pressure on them without really making them do better.

But looking at the halo and mere exposure effects raises some questions and worries. The writer says that bosses and managers might think those who bring coffee or chat a lot are hard workers (Lufkin, 2021). Nowadays, management ideas have improved, and employees learn new ways to work better. Good leaders won't promote someone just because they make good coffee. If changes at work are made based on small things, it's not clear if the company is moving forward. For instance, imagine two sick people: one is at work but not doing much because of a cold and a headache, and the other is at home working online to meet a deadline. A smart manager looks at what both are doing now. If presenteeism wrongly affects how these employees are seen, the team won't look professional.

It's not right to think that being at the office a lot means you'll move up in your career. Lufkin's paper talks about worries about presenteeism and how it affects people's opinions. Sometimes, a person needs a break or a day off to work better, and not being there doesn't mean they're not good at their job. Just being present doesn't mean the work will be good, and this view makes companies stronger and more competitive.
