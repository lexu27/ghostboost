The only way to deal with life’s everyday problems is by controlling your mind. In everything you do, feel about a situation, or whatever action you want to take, all are decided by how well you think. Thinking carefully helps you control your life, handle tough situations, and make smart choices. So, before you act on any decision, it's important to think carefully about the situation and find the best solution. This paper will use critical thinking steps in my own experience to explain what I will do to solve a problem and make a decision. Before reaching the final decision, I will follow each step of critical thinking to make a good decision. According to Medeiros et. (2019), the steps of critical thinking are; finding the problem, not letting emotions take over, and setting solution standards. They also involve collecting and assessing information, thinking about personal values and beliefs, and choosing and reviewing the solution.

When finding the problem, I will see the issues in my family. Often, I get upset easily when there's a small argument, and I don't get along well with my mom since something happened ten years ago. I'm sure she doesn't like me either, even though I've changed and want to visit my childhood home someday. Also, after breaking up with my children’s mother, the kids struggled in school. So, after thinking carefully, I decided to move to my childhood home once my mom is no more and switch my children to a different school.

After many counseling sessions, I learned that managing my feelings well is important. This helps me think better before making hasty decisions or getting too upset. Avoiding negative feelings will help me have a better relationship with my family, as they see me as a problem. The criteria I'll use to find solutions is listing good ideas that help me decide if my choice is right.

Over time, counseling taught me to stick to my values and beliefs in my daily life. In my decision, some of my beliefs include forgiveness as taught in the Bible. Courage and resilience are important values for me, especially as my childhood home reminds me of my mom. Even though my mom is very ill, moving back there seems like the best solution. This decision will help me reflect on the past and start fresh, giving me closure. The children will get a fresh start at the new school and do better academically, and being closer will make it easier to support them.
