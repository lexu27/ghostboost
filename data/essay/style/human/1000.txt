Supervision is when a person with more knowledge helps another person with less knowledge. They talk a lot and it lasts a long time. The first person knows a lot, and the second person knows less. The first person needs to have certain qualities to do this well.

One important quality for a good supervisor is being able to change. Everything is changing nowadays - science, technology, how students learn, how teachers teach. So, a good supervisor needs to be able to change too. Davis (2020) says that a supervisor needs to have qualities like being nice, patient, honest, and fair to have good relationships.

A good supervisor also needs to talk nicely. They need to communicate well and be a good example for students. Beckett (2020) says they need to organize work, give information clearly, and help students. If a supervisor doesn't want to help, it's not good.

Supervisors have many jobs to do. They need to help students learn, teach them about the company, and make sure they have a good attitude at work. They also need to find out where students need help.

If a supervisor is not good, they might only care about themselves, not listen to others, be mean, think they are better than others, and not care about their job. They might be hard to understand when they talk and not give praise.

The supervisor's personality is very important for students and new employees. They need to have the right skills, knowledge, and be able to talk to others well. Not everyone can be a good supervisor. They need to know a lot, follow the company's values, have good qualities, and behave properly.
