Research say that watching services are the future of sharing shows and movies. This way of watching things is very good for the modern time and mixes new technology with old ways of having fun. There are many services now that offer these shows, and it can be hard to pick the best one. According to studies, Disney+ is the best choice compared to Netflix. Disney+ has old and new stuff together which makes it really good for fun (Agnihotri & Bhattacharya, 2022). It takes ideas from popular movies like Marvel, Pixar, and Star Wars, making these worlds even better (Disney, 2022). In general, Disney+ has famous movies they made and also new stuff that many people like, all in a very easy way to watch.
