Terrorism is a big problem for people in the 21st century. Even with many actions taken against it, terrorism is still a big topic. Islamic terrorism is a big type of radicalism that happened in the last few years and was very sad. It started when Osama Bin Laden made al Qaeda in 1989 and did the first bad thing in Yemen by making a bomb in a hotel where American soldiers were staying. Osama Bin Laden believed in a holy war for Muslims against bad people, especially the United States. The biggest bad thing that al Qaeda did was the 9/11 Bombing of the World Trade Centers, where lots of people died, and then the War on Terror started. The United States Army found Osama bin Laden and killed him, but other bad people still did attacks. One of these was the Boston Marathon Bombings made by followers of Osama bin Laden.

The bad attacks make many people worried about how well the United States is fighting against terrorism. But the United States needs to be like the world's "police" because it's the only big country that can control things in other places. By having its army in places with problems, the United States can stop bad things from happening in the world. The Middle East is one of these places, and it's important for the U.S. money and safety. The United States stops the bad groups from growing in the Middle East because if they grow, they can make friends around the world, even in the United States. This can lead to more bad attacks and unfriendly governments in the Middle East. If the United States leaves the Middle East, the bad groups there will take over and get more things to do bad things. Also, there's a risk of bad groups getting nuclear weapons, which can be very dangerous for everyone in the world.
