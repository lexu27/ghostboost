Nursing groups are common in many countries, helping nurse workers grow in their jobs. The American Association of Critical Care Nurses (AACN) is one such group. It started in 1969 to help nurses learn and get more education. This paper talks about what the group offers its members.

Nurses think being in nursing groups is good for them. This helps nurses and all members grow in their jobs (Rowley et al., 2020). It is especially good for nurses in neuro/cardio units. These nurses must do many things at once and make complex choices. They also need to know the newest methods, which is hard without talking to other pros. AACN helps with this by offering programs. Nurses can also get certificates for their skills.

AACN is a non-profit group that helps nurses grow in their jobs. Their goal is to give nurses the tools to help patients and families (AACN, n.d.). Being good at their job is important to AACN. They provide education, networking, and awards to help nurses be their best.

AACN gives awards to nurses who do great work. The Circle of Excellence and Beacon awards are examples of this (AACN, n.d.). Only members can get the Circle of Excellence award, but non-members can get the Beacon award. This helps pros share ideas and grow. It also shows that nurses and their work are important.

AACN offers programs, certifications, grants, and events for nurses. This helps new nurses meet others in the field and learn new things. Networking helps nurses share knowledge and grow in their jobs (Villeneuve & Betker, 2020). Educational programs are key to helping nurses face challenges in their work.

AACN keeps its members updated on changes in nursing. They send emails, press releases, and hold events to share news. They also offer courses and scholarships to help nurses keep learning. This helps nurses get better at their jobs.

In the end, AACN is a big help to nurses in growing in their jobs. Members can learn, make friends, and do research. Awards from AACN inspire nurses to do their best.
