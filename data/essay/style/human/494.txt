President Franklin Roosevelt did many things to stop the Big Sadness, like making new rules. These rules were not just for fixing money and roads but also for helping some groups like people from other places, black people, and workers. They built places for health, special classes, schools, and fun spots, so life got better for them.

The first rule I want to talk about is when they made the Public Works Administration (PWA). It was a big group in America made during the New Deal by President Franklin Roosevelt. This rule not only helped stop the Big Sadness but also gave jobs and good things to work on for people, like workers, people from other places, and black people. They focused on building and public stuff, which made factories better too.

Another rule I want to talk about is the Farm Fixing Act (AAA). This rule tried to make farms better by giving farmers more money if they used less land. This made more people work on farms, and it also made things better for black people, workers, and people from other places. It helped farmers make more money from their crops, but it also made things more expensive for people buying them.

I think the New Deal did a lot to help after the Big Sadness. They made many groups to help in different areas. Also, the government tried to control how much people got paid and how much things cost. They made many programs for people who needed help and didn't have jobs.
