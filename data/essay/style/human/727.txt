Thyroiditis is a sickness connected to swelling and love of the thyroid gland. The thyroid gland, located in the front of the neck below the voice box, makes hormones that control metabolism. Hashimoto's thyroiditis, postnatal thyroiditis, and subacute thyroiditis are the most talked-about kinds of thyroiditis by doctors and researchers. Thyroid problems show in three steps for most cases of thyroiditis. Subacute thyroiditis is a famous sickness that usually starts a few weeks after a viral infection. Hashimoto thyroiditis is an immune sickness that can lead to hypothyroidism, sometimes without symptoms, like a painless thyroid problem, and is linked to increased thyroid antibodies. People with Hashimoto thyroiditis and obvious hypothyroidism often need thyroid treatment for life. When a woman's thyroid gets irritated after having a baby, it's called postpartum thyroiditis.

Treatment of thyroiditis should focus on specific signs and symptoms. Testing, checking, and medical visits are recommended for all cases of thyroiditis to see changes in thyroid function. Acute signs can be treated, and thyroid function usually gets better and stays normal over time. A usual way to find thyroiditis is to feel the thyroid during a doctor visit.
