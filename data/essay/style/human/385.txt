Labor racketeering is when people use unions and power for themselves in a bad way. Organized crime groups made unions do bad things with them. In the early 1900s, this became a big worry for the law and community (Jacobs, 2020). Until the late 1970s and early 1980s, no one really tried to stop this problem (Jacobs, 2020).

When selling alcohol was against the law, criminal groups made money from it, keeping the demand for alcohol high. Even after selling alcohol became legal again in the 1930s, the mafia kept doing their business in a smart way (Jacobs, 2020). They started focusing on other businesses like drugs, gambling, and prostitution (Jacobs, 2020). But they also made money from controlling labor unions, which was another way they made profit.

Gangs liked controlling labor unions because they could easily reach different businesses like waste management, construction, and demolition. They also got healthcare and retirement money from the unions. These legal businesses helped them hide their bad actions like drug trafficking or people smuggling (Jacobs, 2020). They also threatened employers, asked for money, and took bribes.

It's clear that organized crime always wanted to control local businesses and make more money. They did various crimes like prostitution, drug selling, gambling, and using labor unions. Unions helped them get into legit businesses like demolition, construction, and waste management.
