The paper has many words by artists from the 19th and early 20th centuries who shared their feelings instead of reality in their art. Expressionism shows strong feelings through paintings or sculptures. This time was about valuing emotions in art, like in romanticism when drawings showed personal parts of people (Arnason & Mansfield, 2012). Secularism spread a lot in Germany and Austria.

Some artworks in the chapter help people see how artists shared emotions. For example, The Lion Hunt by Delacroix shows violence in society (Arnason & Mansfield, 2012). Also, Munch’s The Scream shows desperation and loneliness in society. Fierce expressionism was popular for showing women’s sexuality, like Nude Girl by Lovis Corinth in 1886, as seen in Figure 1 (Arnason & Mansfield, 2012). So, readers learn about expressionism in art from the chapter.

There was a big change in art in the early 20th century. Young painters formed a group called Die Brucke or ‘The Bridge’ to connect different parts of art (Arnason & Mansfield, 2012). Some painters in this group, like Ludwing Kirchner, talked about empathy and changes in the world. As seen in Figure 2, Kirchner drew Girl Franzi, who was a model in the Brucke group.

In Germany and Austria, artists made sculptures showing the industrial revolution and spiritual beliefs. For example, Vasily Kandinsky drew Composition VII, showing boats in stormy waters, like a biblical flood in Figure 3 (Arnason & Mansfield, 2012). This style spread widely, giving art a religious touch. Other artists, like Gabriele Munter, painted modern relationships. August Macke drew the Great Zoological Garden, showing the shift from the past to modern society in Figure 4 (Arnason & Mansfield, 2012). The art shows how the world is connected through the environment and social groups.

Sculptures showed many things, especially during romanticism. For example, Kneeling Woman by Wilhelm Lehmbruck in 1911 shows women’s sadness in relationships (Arnason & Mansfield, 2012). The sculpture tells the story of Lehmbruck’s struggles during World War I, leading to his suicide. Self-reflection was a big theme in Austria, seen in Portrait of Paris von Guterslah by Egon Schiele in the 1890s (Arnason & Mansfield, 2012). The art shows a man who seems harmful, expressing the inhumanity in society, especially towards the powerless. Chapter 6 shows the changes in art values in Germany and Austria.
