The journalism rules in United Arab Emirates (UAE) are from its constitution. UAE is at number 119 in the world for press freedom as Öztunc & Pierre (2021) say. They say UAE does not give much freedom to speak out. Government control, bad press, limited views, and punishment are ways to limit freedom. Some groups like Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation (MoFAIC) try to show press freedom (United Nations, 2021). But there are limits like legal problems and control that show a big difference (Constitution, 2004). The constitution is the main rule, not giving full rights. So, some freedom for journalists is for peace, media control, and government interests.
Press freedom starts with free reporting. UAE's place in global ratings shows fear of free journalism. This shows they limit freedom to keep control on news and info (Öztunc & Pierre, 2021). Momen et al. (2020) say many media deaths happen in peace countries. UAE is known for good business and big buildings showing peace and wealth (Öztunc & Pierre, 2021). But freedom is limited by the constitution that is meant to give freedom.
In The Canberra Times, a sports reporter was jailed for talking about a match before UAE played against Iraq (The Canberra Times, 2021). The reporter was punished for hate speech and disturbing peace. It's unclear how this was hate speech when it was just talking about the match's result. Other reporters were also fired for not being loyal to the country (The Canberra Times, 2021).
Article 30 of the UAE constitution talks about freedom to speak within the law (Constitution, 2004). The reporter did nothing wrong since they were just saying their thoughts as per this law. But law no. 5 of 2012 says jokes, bad talk, and upsetting the peace are crimes (Constitution, 2004). This makes it hard to know what's right or wrong based on who gets upset.
The constitution lets bad press, control, and limited views to keep power. This makes fake justice by half-following the rules (Öztunc & Pierre, 2021). The government can hide info affecting citizens for politics (Constitution, 2004). Media in UAE don't talk much about unfair jailings or killings of journalists to avoid punishment (Momen, 2020). This leads to more deaths and jailings.
Talking bad about the government or rulers is illegal. Law no. 15 of 1980 is strict on what can be published (Constitution, 2004). This lets censorship and controlling what's published. This hides killings happening in the country. This leads to more control and power for the government.
Press freedom should let news be shared without control. This helps better government and truth. With correct info, people can call out wrongs and make changes (Momen, 2020). Even presidents can be jailed if they break laws (Momen, 2020). This happens with honest news not influenced from outside. Free news helps people know what's happening.
Limiting press freedom helps the government keep power by controlling info (Momen, 2020). But it also keeps peace by hiding bad things done by officials. This helps the monarchy stay strong by letting them do anything without punishment (Momen, 2020).
The constitution punishes those who break the law no. 3 made in 1987 (Constitution, 2004). This law stops news about rulers unless they agree. This keeps people in the dark to avoid lawsuits and keep peace.
Limiting press freedom helps governance and peace in the country. People know their rights now and can ask for change if they see wrongs. Laws like code no. 15 of 1980 make sure all news shows the government in a good light. This raises questions if the constitution is for the people or to protect the government.
