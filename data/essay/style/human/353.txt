Individual freedoms and national security are sometimes different. It is important that national security and individual freedoms work together. Individual freedoms are rights protected by the US Constitution. This paper says that individual freedoms should always be kept, even when thinking about national security.

This essay says that protecting individual freedoms while keeping national security is very important in democracy. US President Joe Biden thinks democracy is important for freedom, peace, and dignity. Unlike other systems, democracy values individual freedoms more than national security. This can cause arguments because every situation is different. But individual freedoms are protected in many parts of life like migration, cyber security, and international relations.

There might be an argument that national security is more important than individual freedoms. This idea is often used by authoritarian governments. This idea is not right because national security should protect all citizens, not just the country as a whole. Every citizen is important and their freedoms should be respected.

In conclusion, it was discussed that individual freedoms should always be kept, even when thinking about national security. Authoritarian governments might want to sacrifice freedoms for their own benefit. In democratic countries, individual freedoms are very important and should never be taken away. These freedoms are important for the strength of democratic countries.
