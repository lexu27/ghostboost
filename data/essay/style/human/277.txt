The idea of "gender jobs" is often used to understand writings from long-ago times. These jobs seemed very clear during the Anglo-Saxon time. The story Beowulf is from the kind of stories that praise the heroes and their brave actions. Ladies are shown as possessions for men in Beowulf and are there to help the male figures. Also, ladies are used to help the men's story move forward. However, ladies are not focused on much in the story, and men's roles are more important. The queen of the Swedes didn't have a name, she was known as the king's wife, Onela. The male characters like Hrothgar, Beowulf, Wiglaf, and Unferth had most of the story in the poem. This is why mentions of women are not as many. The poem talks about a woman who did her duties in the family and with the group, showing the traditional roles of women in Beowulf (Heaney 620). This part shows what was expected from women in the past, that they should care for men and be kind. Queen Modthryth was shown later in the story as very different from Queen Hygd, who was independent and disliked by men. They said disapprovingly, "Even a very beautiful queen should not act that way," until she married Offa, who praised her for being in control. Society only accepted Queen Modthryth when she got married, suggesting that women were worth less if they weren't married.
