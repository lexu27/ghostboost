As a rule, making fake things and making bad things happen are usually not thought to be the same, because they have different goals. But, some bad groups have started to make fake things to make a lot of money. The famous Italian Mafia is known for trying to control the Italian market and use the money for their bad plans (Beqiraj et al., 2020). Even though it's hard to stop the Mafia in Italy, we need better tools to find and stop fake things from being sold in Europe.

The Italian Mafia is very famous for making fake things, mainly because they are very powerful in Italy. One thing they do a lot is making fake stuff to sell, like in 2017, they made fake olive oil and sold it to places in the EU (Bacchi, 2017). Even though this may seem small compared to other bad things they do, it still affects the trade between Italy and other European countries. This hurts the reputation of Italian food makers and companies, which is not good for the economy. So, we must stop fake food products to help Italian companies keep growing.

To fight this, we need to find and stop fake things from being sold. But, it's very hard to fight the Mafia directly because they are too strong in Italy. So, for now, we need to focus on finding fake things and stopping them from being sold (Juntunen, 2019). This way, the Mafia won't make as much money from fake stuff, and there will be less fake things around.

If we make better tools to find and remove fake products from the market in Europe, the Italian government and other groups can fight against the Mafia's fake stuff. Even if we can't stop the Mafia completely right now because they are too deep into Italy's politics and economy, we can still try to stop fake products. This way, we can slowly make a difference and reduce the number of fake things being sold.
