A clinic worker helper is someone who has many office jobs that must be done fast and good. Tools for managing time are very helpful. One tool that is used a lot is Call Please, which helps with phone calls (Helms, 2021). It makes logging calls easy and lets you make a list of calls in order. So, Call Please saves a lot of time and stops mistakes like forgetting a patient or calling the wrong person.

Evernote is another tool that is used a lot to help work better. It can be used to save important notes, make messages, lists, tables, and look at the info on any other device (Helms, 2021). It is good for taking care of patients and signing them in, as it helps to organize pictures, notes, photos of papers, scans, and send them to doctors.

Also, clinic workers use Todoist, which helps to see tasks in one place. It works with other apps and lets you make a plan for the day's work (Helms, 2021). So, you can divide time well for tasks and see how well you did at the end of the day. Another very important tool is NueMD, a billing software for medical stuff with electronic records. It has things like an online patient place, e-prescriptions, labs, and can make custom reports (Helms, 2021). It is very useful since it stops paperwork and keeps info safe in the cloud. With it, workers can find the right info fast, organize work, and have fewer missed appointments.

The clinic worker is usually the first to meet patients and learn about what they need. The Medical Assisting Pocket is a tool that helps them do better and give fast and good service (Helms, 2021). A good pocket guide has medical words, billing help, and insurance codes. It also has handbooks and training for office and clinic work, helping to improve skills and work faster. So, there are many tools for time management, but the ones mentioned are the best for helpers.
