The immigration places of Ellis Island and Angel Island are very important for history. Until now, these spots hold tales of many people who came there from 1880 to 1930. Ellis Island was the biggest and busiest place for people coming to the USA from Europe. It was surprising for me to know that many ladies were held by the workers at Ellis Island, as before World War II, ladies couldn't come in the country alone. It was also amazing to know that since 1907, kids under 16 could not come in the country without a parent. Those who arrived at Ellis Island alone were sent back home. People who didn't pass the health check were sent back home too.

It's amazing to me that the workers managed to check so many people every day. The pictures and videos in the station's records show that many people passed through. Another interesting thing is that workers could separate kids from parents if they didn't believe they were really family. For example, when Lucy Attarian remembers the time she and her family were checked at Ellis Island, the worker didn't think she was their daughter because she looked different. But when she cried, the worker believed she was their child. The workers were careful because many kids were coming to the country with the wrong families.

Even though Angel Island Immigration Station was called the "Ellis Island" of the West, it was very different, and how they treated people was different too. This was because most people at Angel Island were from China, and there were strict rules for Asian immigrants. Many of them had to go through tough times like detention and sickness because the place was crowded and dirty.

The walls have lots of Chinese poems in the barracks. People shared their fears, dreams, and hopes for the future in those poems, and I think it's great how art can give hope even in hard times. For many people in the barracks, it was a tough time: they didn't know if they would be sent back, away from their families, and not knowing when they would see them again. Officials at Angel Island only let people in if they had a job or family in America. To make sure someone was really related to Chinese people already in the country, they had to answer many questions. The questions were too detailed, even for family members to know about each other. The papers where these family stories were kept were called "Coaching Papers". This is why they called some of the people who passed the hard questions "Paper Sons and Daughters" because they weren't really related to the Chinese people already in America.
