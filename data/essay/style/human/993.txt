In Chapter 3, we talk about how parole started in the US and how it is used now. One important point is that new studies say prisoners who leave without parole help have more problems than those who leave with parole rules. It suggests that if there's proof, prisoners can get parole again. The authors think a good group should decide who gets parole. This group needs clear rules to work well. The chapter is clear, but needs more details, like how the parole group works.

Chapter 4 talks about parole checks and how they differ from getting parole. The rules for checks have changed a lot since the 1980s. The authors talk about programs that help prisoners change and stop going back to jail, and they should not cost too much. They believe these programs are very important. Even though the programs are explained well, more history could make them even better for the next chapters.
