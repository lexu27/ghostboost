"Book called 'Young Goodman Brown' made by Nathaniel Hawthorne in year 1835, but story happened in old Puritan New England during year 17 hundred. Puritans leave church in England, come to Plymouth Rock and start Plymouth and Boston. They biggest Christian group in New England at that time, but also Quakers and Anabaptists live there. Puritans think very strict, no room for mistakes; like bad thoughts and dreams are same as doing sin. They think Native Americans who not Christian are like devil's kids. 'Young Goodman Brown' story in time of Salem Witch Trials in Massachusetts shows how Salem Puritans not always believe what they say."
