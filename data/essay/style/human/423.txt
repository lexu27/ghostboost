There is no easy answer to what it means to be human. Some may say being human is about being free and having control over their own lives. For others, being human is about using the nice things from society, wearing clothes, and going to work every day, which animals cannot do. It's hard to know how people want to live because everyone has different needs, wishes, and ideas about this. This essay talks about the On Being podcast and answers those questions.

In the podcast, Thich Nhat Hanh talks about why people need to be human. He says, "we need to stay human to understand and be kind" (Onbeing.org 30:53 – 30:58). The monk adds that being human means having the right to make mistakes, but not the "right to keep making mistakes" (Onbeing.org 31:15 – 31:20). So, being human is about being careful, responsible, and kind. In short, being human is about being nice. People live in a world with violence and fear and struggle to talk to each other well (Onbeing.org). As a result, they don’t know what is the real way to live. According to Thich Nhat Hanh, people wish to live without anger, be mindful, and manage their feelings. Yet, a regular person today may find it hard to live this way.

In general, the podcast is very inspiring as it talks about being human, the problems people have in today’s crazy world, and ways to avoid them. The Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh seems like a thoughtful person whose ideas we should take seriously. Even though I don't share the Buddhist beliefs, I really admire Thich Nhat Hanh for inspiring me to learn more about being mindful.
