Justice is very important in a country and should be fair in crime and social things. Social justice says everyone should get the same rights in money, politics, and social things no matter their class or race (Chisholm-Burns et al., 2021). In 1965, John F. Kennedy saw many children not in school but outside. He wanted all kids to learn in the United States. To help kids not feel hopeless, we need to change the teaching about being poor from one family to the next. Head Start was made to help kids in education for fair treatment. It began in 1965 by Lyndon Baines Johnson (Pillay, 2018). This writing will talk about how Head Start helps fairness in the US, focusing on what kids learn and do in the program.
Head Start helps kids from poor families under five to be ready for school. If they weren't in the program, they might miss out on school (Johnson & Jackson, 2019). Kids learn to treat everyone fairly no matter their race or family background.
The way families are picked for the program is fair. When a family is chosen, they get help based on what they need. People visit the homes often to see how they can help with health, parenting, drug issues, and alcohol problems. They keep focused on the family's needs.
Head Start gives counseling to families. They help with health issues like anxiety or feeling sad (Williams et al., 2018). Poor families often have mental health problems because life is hard. People working in the program can give tests and visit homes to help in emergencies (Nix et al., 2018). They can change the help based on new things they find out.
To help everyone in the community, the program teaches about Head Start in schools, events, and churches. This helps families who qualify to join the program. They share forms with the requirements for families to join (Gatewood, 2019). They ask people in the community to tell others about the program who might qualify. This gives a chance for everyone to join and helps fairness.
Head Start keeps records of families. They update when things change and check on progress. If a family's situation changes, they might leave the program to help others. They check often to make sure only families who really need help stay.
In the end, we need to understand what fairness means in early education. Head Start helps kids under five get ready for school. Fairness should continue even after kids leave the program. Teachers in schools should teach good values and be role models for kids. Society should not allow discrimination based on money or privilege and teach kids to be kind to everyone.
