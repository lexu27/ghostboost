Accountable Care Organizations (ACO) were made to watch and help Medicare and Medicaid. More than 900 ACOs have started 1300 deals with private and public hospitals all over the country since 2010 to handle payments for Medicare patients. This idea makes healthcare groups responsible for the cost and quality of care by making a system of value-based payment - which means hospitals get paid for results, not each service given. Also, "ACO contract parts have money responsibility, quality measuring, and data sharing about population health," leading to better care and lower costs. For instance, they saved about $700 each year for every cancer patient. But they didn't save much on surgical procedures with the ACO plan. It seems that not every kind of doctor sees the benefit of this plan yet. Still, I think the idea of paying for value is fair for patients because it makes sure they get the best care for good results. 

Reliance Healthcare is a good example of a successful ACO that worked with emergency departments (ED) in Michigan to manage care for Medicare patients. This group has three parts: doctors, an IT team, and managers. The main goal of Reliance Healthcare and EDs working together was to lower healthcare costs by stopping unnecessary hospital stays through organized work by reliance nurses, managers, and IT teams. A new report said this plan could stop, on average, two avoidable admissions each day from 2014 to 2020, which cut care costs a lot. I believe that Reliance Healthcare should keep working with doctors and making more deals because keeping people out of the hospital for no reason is a big problem in our hospitals; so, an ACO plan can stop wasted money.
