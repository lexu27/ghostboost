McDonald’s was upset with their old boss, Steve Easterbrook. They said he did some bad things with workers before he left. Easterbrook didn’t tell the truth and got rid of the proof. He cared more about himself than McDonald’s. People who own part of McDonald’s are mad and are taking McDonald’s to court for not stopping bad behavior quickly and not being accurate. They say when a company doesn’t hire or keep workers well, it’s called negligent recruitment and retention. The boss should have known about the bad things workers might do. Companies can get in trouble for their workers doing bad things on purpose. This study looks at how companies can be careless at work, which is the most common mistake.

If McDonald’s doesn’t check a worker’s background and they hurt someone, McDonald’s might have to take responsibility. For example, if McDonald’s doesn’t look at a chef’s past work, qualifications, and current job groups before hiring them, and the chef makes many mistakes that make people sick, McDonald’s can be blamed for not checking well. This is why they need to check for criminal history. If someone hits coworkers and customers and it turns out they had a violent past, the company can be responsible. If an employer knows an employee acts dangerously but doesn’t fire them, McDonald’s could be in trouble for not keeping others safe.
