One of the olden things that show the life of women in Old Egypt is the sculpture called Nefertiti Bust. It is a big 47-cm tall statue of the queen of Egypt, Nefertiti, who was the pharaoh’s wife and lived in the 13 th century BC. This thing is now shown at the Egyptian Museum in Berlin. Because the queen was very important, this old thing might have been used for remembering or for when someone dies. Usually, statue things in Old Egypt were for worshipping ancestors at home or for putting in graves. This shows how important a woman could be in old Western places, where she could be the leader of a country. The statue is very important because it shows how much people liked Nefertiti. Also, this old thing is valuable because it was kept very well, so we can see how it was made very carefully. People who work with this statue said the colors look fresh. So, not just for history and culture, this statue is also good art and shows how to make things very well. It might be good to talk more about this statue and how women were important in old Egypt.
