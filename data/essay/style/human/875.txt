Communication and working together are very important for one person and a team to do well. The first part of the book Technical Communication talks about technical communication and why it is important. I found out that technical communication helps people learn about things or how to do things. It can also help people change their thoughts or do certain things. I also learned that technical documents show the culture of a group, are made together, and have special parts like a specific reader, clear instructions to solve a problem, design, pictures, and words. Lastly, I found out that technical communication is a good skill for work because it helps people read and make technical documents.

When I worked with my friends and classmates, I had different experiences. One bad experience was when some team members didn't want to help with the work we were doing together. They didn't share their ideas because we were all talking at the same time, and they couldn't say what they wanted. The problem could have been avoided if we took turns to speak. A good experience was when we did a project at school on Zoom where everyone helped. The project went well because we had clear roles in the group and one person leading us.

I think that working well together online needs planning and a good plan. It's important to give each person a job and plan all our meetings so we don't have any problems with timing. If there are any disagreements, we need one person who everyone trusts to help solve them. Also, to do well, a group should use tools like Zoom and share documents online.

Technical communication helps people work together by letting them help others learn, decide, and do things. Having good technical communication skills makes people more valuable at work and helps them work better in teams.
