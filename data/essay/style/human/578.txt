I choose one special work that not all people do. I decide to talk about teaching job or skill as a work type. For most persons who do production work, teaching as a job is extra work given with main work. Main job is a person in the job market. But, some people like teaching and have true interest in it. Sharing knowledge and experience with these people is a real interest.

Teacher's work includes giving basic knowledge about job and must help student in first job. Emotional support and belief in new person are important in these times. Teacher's work mixes professional job (drawing, dancing, fixing shoes) with talking and feelings. So, not all people can choose this work as it is tiring.

Teaching job has always been important, especially in East. Modern society respects this job. But, young people don't always want to do this job. Even though, this job is very important for society, people may not see it daily. Teacher's examples inspire people to work hard.

Besides spiritual role, teachers are important for society's economy. Education is base for future of country. Young specialists are from different social groups and represent country internationally. Technology changes how teachers work and what they need to know. Some older teachers may feel not enough anymore.

Plato's idea fits this job well. Developed society can have clear division of work. Durkheim also said this, combining division of work with cooperation. Teacher can benefit local place, city, and country. This job doesn't really match with other jobs.

John Locke says all jobs should have mutual respect. Every worker should have right to use resources and make own. Even though teaching job doesn't make physical thing, it makes intellectual thing. Copyright can be an issue for teachers making new ideas.
