Technological progress makes business go online. This needs good online marketing through media. Old ways are not as good as new media now. Traditional ads reach many people, not good for companies. They spend money for little results. They use old methods like billboards or TV ads. So, many people who see these ads are not interested and don't buy the products. New media suits modern society better. Generation Z likes buying things they see on social media. That's why new media is on platforms like YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok. Social media influencers work with companies to promote products online. This is better than old ways of advertising. People trust influencers more than old ads.
