Background
The prayer effect is about how we think. It is about two things we do when we pray: we look at different things and we think about them a lot. When people pray, they look at things that are very spiritual. Praying regularly and saying the same things over and over again helps us think a lot about God. Froese and Jones (2021) said that praying makes us believe in things we can't see, so it's like having a strong belief. Also, praying together has been used for a long time to have power in politics (Froese & Jones, 2021). So, some people think of praying as a powerful, holy thing that connects us to God.

The idea that praying is powerful and political is also in Martin's writing. Religion has stories about times when praying helped win battles (Martin, 2019). For example, in A.D. 174, soldiers found water by praying and it washed away their enemies (Martin, 2019). Both writers say that prayer is like a weapon and using it helps us get closer to God.

After praying, people often feel like they belong and feel happy. Saying prayers over and over again helps us remember what our religion teaches us (Froese & Jones, 2021). Martin also said that in his writing, and he said that praying helps us understand things better. When we pray in response to something, it's like we're making a future wish (Froese & Jones, 2021). Long ago, Christians asked God to protect them in battles. They prayed to feel less scared, even before Jesus was born (Martin, 2019). People who started these prayers wanted to make soldiers feel better before fighting. They promised that if they won, they would go to heaven (Martin, 2019). Both writers say that asking God to help like this has always been part of Christian history. They both agree that praying is about doing things before they happen; they don't see a big difference in their thoughts.

Summary
Changing your mind
In the second letter to the Corinthians, Paul talks about changing your mind for God, which can save you (2 Corinthians 7:10). Changing your mind, according to Paul, means feeling sad for what you did wrong and not doing it again. Changing your mind makes your soul clean, and a clean soul can understand the Holy Spirit better.
