Nursing Theory Case Study

The nurse's goal for the COPD patient is to help them breathe better and clear their airways. They want the patient to cough well and get rid of the bad stuff from their lungs. They also want the patient to breathe better, take care of themselves, exercise more, and eat well. The study looks at things like how well the lungs work, overall health, exercise, and how active the patient is, how much they struggle to breathe, sudden bad times, a rating system called BODE, and how many people die. The current care is working well for the 75-year-old Native American patient, who is doing better with exercise and health.

One theory called 'care-based on-oxygenation' (CBOO) is about giving the best care based on how much oxygen is in the patient's blood. It says that good care leads to better results for the patient with COPD.

The International Council of Nursing (ICN) and the World Health Organization (WHO) made a nursing theory that says nursing is a big part of human life, including health care around the world. Nursing theory helps nurses understand their role in helping people and communities. It teaches about the personal, emotional, and cultural parts of care and how they are all connected. Nursing theory is important because it helps nurses know why they do what they do for sick people.

Studying nursing theory helps nurses think better and solve problems in health care. Critical thinking skills help nurses find gaps in research, consider different ideas, and learn new things. Nurses will learn to think like a nurse by using their skills in real-life situations. Nursing theory classes teach about different theories and how to make good decisions in health care.

As a registered nurse, one's role is to lead and make decisions for the best care of patients. Nurses will use their skills to guide other medical staff in providing good care. Understanding nursing theory helps nurses improve how they care for patients and plan their treatment. Nursing care plans are important for guiding nurses and other medical staff in caring for patients.
