Tesla come to car market strong with leaders who have lots of energy, smart ways to sell, and good products. This makes them have a big part of the market. This makes other car sellers like Volkswagen and Toyota not happy because they sell cars in a different way. More cars and choices for people is good, but one company having all the power is bad because of wanting too much. 

Tesla coming to the car market helps people have more choices. They sell cars in a new way, not like others, which is good for choosing. More cars being sold means prices can go down, so people can buy more things. More companies selling cars mean more choices for people to buy things with their money.

But some companies want to have all the power, which is not good for people who want choices. This is bad because they only care about money, not people. 

My mom, who is a Christian, thinks it's good when new companies sell cars because people can choose more. She thinks competition is good as long as it's fair. She said something about not cheating in business, as it's not good. She thinks having one company control everything is like making people slaves, which is not good.
