One good thing that shows the writer knows a lot about theories is the last part in the first chapter of Maus, where the dad of the storyteller advises him not to tell what he said about his young days. It shows that Spiegelman knows how to talk well to his readers who might not know much about the Holocaust and just see it in books. By repeating the love stories of the main guy in his young times, he makes him easier to understand, likeable, and even though he is a mouse, more human. This choice in talking helps the readers, who might not know a lot about the Holocaust except from school, to feel more connected to the topic. 

Also, just putting this part in the chapter gives it a personal touch. In this part, the dad tells the storyteller to not talk about what he just said because it's not about the Holocaust, showing it's more personal. But when the readers read the chapter, they already know the storyteller doesn't keep his word because the story is right there, shown in both drawings and words. Including this part shows Spiegelman knows most readers don't have a direct link to the Holocaust. Yet, by adding this, he makes the readers feel like they know something personal and secret, which helps them connect better to the topic. So, adding the part with the dad asking to leave out the stories of his young days is smart in more than one way.
