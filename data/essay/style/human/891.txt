One of the main things for good and important work in the hospital is to make sure that every worker keeps learning and growing. Doing things based on evidence is a good way for nurses to use new research to do better things for patients. According to Koota et al. (2021), the learning about evidence-based work in this study made emergency nurses feel more positive and know more, be more confident, have better skills, and act better (p. 23). So, bringing in evidence-based work is a good change for the hospital.
But, it's found that the use of evidence-based work is not much in Memorial Regional Hospital in Hollywood, Florida. The problem is mostly about the workers having too much to do and not enough money for learning things. Right now, the hospital focuses on spending money on things that work quickly. But, evidence-based work, which is a new way to do things, might help save money by getting rid of old, slow, and less good ways of doing things.
Two big problems from this are that nurses might not get good education and might feel tired and stressed. When nurses can't read new research, they might not help patients well or learn new things. And if they can't use new, faster ways of working, they might struggle with too much work. Also, according to Sultana et al. (2020), evidence-based work can help reduce stress for nurses. That's why this problem needs more attention in hospitals all around the country.
