The very bad effect of colonialism on native people who have suffered from the white colonists cannot be accepted. In Chinua Achebe's "Things Fall Apart," we see how the local community breaks down because of the white people coming in. They bring their beliefs, ways of thinking, and other white stuff to the local people, almost destroying the Ibo culture and making the people very sad.
The book's title itself talks about how everything is falling apart because of the white people. When Africa was split into many small countries, the impact on the Ibo people was very strong in Achebe's book. The Ibo people had to learn the white culture and this made them feel like they lost their own culture a lot.
The white colonists thought only their own culture was good, and this almost destroyed the Ibo culture, as we see in Achebe's book. The white people made the Ibo people accept their ways and teach them to their children. This made the Ibo people lose their culture and identity, and their community started to fall apart, like the book shows very clearly.
