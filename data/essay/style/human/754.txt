In the internet time, when many information can find by almost everyone, privacy is very important for internet users. One of the basic rights is the right to privacy, which the government protects with privacy laws. Belize also has privacy laws in the Data Protection Act. This act tells the main rules for protecting data and who can see and work with it and when.
Protecting data means explaining important points. Belize's Data Protection Act is similar to the European GDPR from 2018 and the United Kingdom's Data Protection Act from 1998. It controls "collecting, keeping, using, and sharing personal data" (Data Protection Act, 2021). It explains what data is private, what can be done with it, and who can do these things.
Even though the government or organizations usually have the power, there are some exceptions. Paragraph 10 of the Data Protection Act bans using personal data, except for health care workers. Paragraph 21 talks about moving data from a person to a processor, and part (d) talks about "keeping secrets professionally" (Data Protection Act, 2021). This might explain why health care workers are an exception. People trust professionals with their data because they believe professionals won't misuse it.
Trust in a professional comes from many things, like reputation. A professional gains reputation by their actions and success in their job. They also need to meet certain standards to be seen as a professional. For example, Encyclopedia of pharmacy practice lists eight professionalism principles: caring, excellence, ethics, respect, communication, accountability, integrity, and justice. These standards aren't just for health care but for any profession.
Belize's Data Protection Act explains personal privacy in detail. It says what information is confidential, how it can be used, who can use it, and when. Besides the government and legal groups, people under professional secrecy can also access private data. They must meet certain standards to be professionals, but if they do, they can use personal data for work. Overall, protecting personal data is very important in society. By passing the Data Protection Act, Belize's government tried to keep its people safe in this matter.
