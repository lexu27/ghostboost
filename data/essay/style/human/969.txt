Background
Fairy tales are stories about princesses who need help, but they also have secret messages that teach kids about life and how to act with others. Even if some tales have changed over time, they still show old-fashioned ideas about boys and girls and how they should behave. These ideas can stay with kids for a long time, even without them knowing. This study looks at fairy tales by the Grimm Brothers like Cinderella, Snow White, and Sleeping Beauty to see how they show social rules and boy-girl stuff. By talking and acting out these stories, kids can think about what they mean and if they are fair. This research shows that thinking carefully is not just for grown-ups, but kids can learn it too. Thinking in this way can help kids not be too influenced by these stories.
