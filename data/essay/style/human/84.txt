This study looked at a note on the bill about the daily dishes. They wanted to see if this note affected how much people tipped the server. The study tried to understand how much people usually tip in restaurants. They also thought about other things like how good the food was, the server's gender, how big the group was, and if the customers came often.

The study did well because it was clear, easy to do again, and could work in different places. But, the note was different for each special, so people liked it in different ways. Also, they only did the study in one restaurant, so it's hard to say if it would be the same in other places. These things may change how much people tip, so the study's results might be different.

It's not clear if just having a note or what the note said affected the results. To check this, the authors could have asked servers to write different notes, some with no real info, like saying have a nice day or drawing a smiley face. Also, they could have tried different ways, like giving servers to customers randomly instead of groups.

Some things in the study might change how true it is. The servers were told to act the same way, so other things wouldn't mess up the results. But how servers feel might change the tip amount, so the cause might not be clear. Also, some things that might happen could make it hard to use the results outside the study. For example, if the server was a young woman, it might not work the same if it was an older man, because of gender. Or, if it was a fancy place, the results might not fit for other kinds of restaurants. If the meal was a buffet, people might tip less because they think the waiter did less work.

Lastly, the study only had two types of groups, servers, and groups eating together, with no details on group size. They could have added a third group of people eating alone, to see how size and interactions affect tipping. This would also show if gender changes the results.
