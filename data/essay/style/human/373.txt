Current problem with Nike is about bad company culture, where women are treated badly by powerful men. There are four ways to fix problem: absolving, solving, resolving, and dissolving (Ackoff, 2019). For Nike to get better, dissolving is the only way. Dissolving means fixing the causes of problem. Absolving ignores the problem, solving just gives compensation, and resolving helps women fight but doesnâ€™t change bad culture (Singh, 2018). Nike needs to do more than let women fight.
Nike needs to change culture from top to bottom. If bad things are okay at the top, they will happen at the bottom too (Singh, 2018). Parker and Nike leaders must make rules for everyone. They need to stop bad behavior and prevent it from happening again.
Plan is to check everyone at Nike and see who is part of the problem. People involved should leave the company, including Mr. Parker and board members. New leaders will create a new culture with fairness, skills, and differences.
