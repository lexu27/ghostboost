It was very surprising to read about Gerai and the Dayak people. They see gender in a special way, not like in the West. The Dayak think both genders are good. They believe in male strength and female persistence. This helps the society be equal and happy. I think it is good to know about such cultures. In many modern places, genders fight a lot. For example, male strength is linked to being too aggressive. It is about the values we learn from society. The West values toughness and aggression in men, shown in their actions like sexual abuse. This is different from the Dayak way, which is more fair and peaceful.
Even if it sounds strange, I think it shows how society has long misunderstood issues like rape. People often blame biology for rape, but it is more about society's ideas. Society sees men as strong and women as weak. In a study, victims of rape were seen as weak and feminine. This shows how society's views affect how we see sexual violence.
