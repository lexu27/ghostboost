Chapter 12 talks about how the Americas were found in 1450-1600, with people from Europe coming to the southern continent and trading with Asia, Africa, and Europe. The chapter starts by saying that the powerful Ottoman and Chinese empires didn’t join the Americans' journey (Adelman et al., 2015, p. 475). It is said that many Asian people didn’t really understand Columbus’ discovery. This discovery changed how countries in Europe, Africa, and Asia lived because they started to trade more. China, with lots of people, played a big role in the world.

They tried something new by going to the west, which created the New and Old Worlds. Having information was important for power (Adelman et al., 2015, p. 478). The Ottomans took over places like Syria and Egypt, but couldn’t conquer Iran. Europe was also changing because of the Protestant movement. The Portuguese were in Africa and Asia, which caused conflicts.

Chapter 13 talks about how the New and Old Worlds, China, Africa, and Europe started to mix more. They talk about mercantilism, where countries wanted gold and silver. After the Spanish took most of the gold, other Europeans tried to get it by selling crops and attacking ships (Adelman et al., 2015, p. 520). There was a time when it got cold, and many cities in South America were destroyed by sickness. Europeans moved to the Atlantic coast.

The Ottomans and Ming empires also faced problems because of the cold. Peasants rebelled because of hunger and inflation. The Ottomans lost power, and Arab provinces became independent. The Ming dynasty fell, and the Qing dynasty took over. Many people died in Beijing from hunger, and the economy suffered because of the new silver.
