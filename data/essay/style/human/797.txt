The world farm money situation has big companies. They are very strong and can make rules and ways for the farm business (Chemnitz et al., 2017). This has problems like hurting nature, not treating people fair, and not helping poor people. Making changes in what people buy can help make things different in this area. But this is only a small part of what needs fixing. The most important thing missing is the help from the government.

I liked learning about how farms got so big now. The biggest reason for this growth was new technology that changed how farms work. Machines could gather lots of crops much faster than people, making lots of food. Companies could even sell crops they didn't grow yet. This made them grow even more, but they didn't always think about how this affects the world, poor people, or farmers.

Another interesting thing about how farms grew so fast was how we buy food. The way stores sell food now affects what we buy and what food is there, especially in rich and poor countries. So, in the economy, how big a food store is decides how much power it has over what people buy and who they buy from. The problem now is that a few big companies control a lot, and they don't care about how farms work now.
