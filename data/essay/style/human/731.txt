A secret in business is very important. It helps a company to be better than others. This secret is special because it tells about how the company works. It can be a word, a saying, a picture, or a mix of these. To get protection for this secret, it must meet some rules. It must help the company make money, only a few people should know about it, and there are papers that say it must be kept secret.
Different from a trademark, a business secret is bigger. A trademark protects the name, logo, or how a product looks. A business secret, like a patent or a copyright, is a way to keep ideas safe (Andreicovici, 2021). If someone takes, uses, or tells this secret in a wrong way, it is not fair and against the rules.
There are two main ways to keep a business secret safe. One way is to make papers, deals, and steps to protect the business idea (Halbert & Ingulli, 2003). Another way is to use special tech to keep it safe from people who want to take it. Breaking these rules can lead to trouble with the law and judges.
So, if someone takes secret info and tells others, the company can ask for money to make up for the loss. They can also stop making products that use the stolen secret. The person who did this might go to jail or pay a lot of money. These rules are for both ways to keep a business secret safe. To use a trademark, you need permission from the owner. The owner can choose who can know and use the secret. Both sides must agree to keep it a secret.
