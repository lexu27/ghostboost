Most American people who invest and do business not like news that checks the business area. This idea is important because it shows secret fights in the media, especially in finding and telling news about business and trade. News companies can look into all parts of the economy and tell people about it. But this right has been made less important over time by top business people. The main reasons for this difficulty are that business people want to keep their companies looking good. This idea can start arguments as it can make people talk about the whole thing. Business people might say they only say no to checking their business to keep it private and not to hide things about what they sell. Making news about one company can make it weak against its rivals. With the details, the other side can plan to ruin the company. This is a really important topic in journalism and society classes as it tells about the problems journalism faces and how it affects society.

Rules affect people differently and sometimes they don’t treat all groups the same, like Black Americans. This idea can start arguments as it might be seen as being about race. Government rules affect people in different ways, but some rules hurt some groups, like African and Indian Americans. This topic is very important in journalism and society classes as it shows what role news has in making rules real and how it affects people.
