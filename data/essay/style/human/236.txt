The editing in first episode of Money Heist series is very good. It is fast and shows important things in story. For example, when character leaves car, camera shows what she takes. Also, camera focuses on objects that are important later. Like phone that rings. Show uses fast editing with close-ups to show guns, money, and things that tell about characters.
Close-ups of characters are moving and show background slowly. Camera moves when characters move. Editing is fast like talking. In speeches, camera moves to make tension. Characters in close-ups are not in middle of screen, but in first or third. 
Camera is shaky when characters feel bad. When characters walk, camera moves too. Steady or shaky camera shows different things happening in story. Tension is main feeling in story. Editing keeps tension by showing characters close-up instead of whole room.
