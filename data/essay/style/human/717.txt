'Worldwide improvement' means changing factories to make things for selling to other countries, instead of just for selling nearby. This idea was first noticed when a big problem happened at a Toyota factory in Thailand. Toyota cars were not selling well locally, so Toyota decided to change the factory to focus on making cars for other countries. It took time, but it worked out well, and now the Thailand factory makes things for other countries. Toyota people said that if the factory was made to switch between selling locally and internationally from the start, the problem would have been smaller. Toyota made up the phrase 'worldwide improvement.' It's about changing old factories to make cars for nearby markets and also for export. It's about being able to change fast and not lose a lot of time when the market changes. Toyota said it was a problem turned into something good. This idea has good and bad points. It costs a lot and takes time for Toyota to change all their factories to be ready for problems in any market. If they keep seeing problems in the market, changing the factories won't help because no one will want their cars. But this idea also helps keep factories running, saves jobs, and makes money. Having new factories that can change easily can be good in the future.
