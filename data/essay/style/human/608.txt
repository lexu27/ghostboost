The democracy needs people to talk and help each other in communities. A writer talks about how America's groups have changed in an essay called "Bowling Alone: Americaâ€™s Declining Social Capital". In democracy, people make groups and talk a lot. These groups help to fix problems quickly because people know what's happening and talk to each other a lot. Putnam says these groups help with talking, knowing each other, and fixing issues together. So, when people make groups, democracy works better.

But in America, fewer people are joining groups and talking to each other. Over the years, there are fewer clubs, groups, and religious connections. People move a lot and don't need to make strong bonds with others. Putnam says moving a lot is like moving plants a lot; it's hard to grow new roots. So, changes in how Americans live are making it harder to talk and work together, which might hurt democracy in the USA.
