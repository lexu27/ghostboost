In a small meaning, the "zero-sum story" is a belief that there is a contest between different racial groups, and when one group makes progress, it can be bad for the resources and place of another (McGhee). This story is very popular in the conservative media and has been told in many ways for a long time. The bad effects of the "zero-sum" idea on the United States are big and have many kinds. This way of thinking made more costs in money, politics, and society for all people in the United States. One example shown by McGhee is about the history of public swimming pools in cities all over the US. In the early 1900s, there were big public swimming pools in many US cities, but at that time, "public" mostly meant only for white people. After many drowning accidents, local governments were told to let everyone use the pools no matter what race they were, which made some white people angry. So, cities decided to close or make the pools private instead of letting people from different races use them freely. This is an example of how public things were ruined and how costs went up a lot for everyone because of the "zero-sum" idea.
Another bad example shared by McGhee is political - many white people stopped wanting social government rules about jobs and benefits after Black people started asking for them too. This means less fairness and benefits for the whole country because people who believe in the "zero-sum" idea don't want other races to get help from these rules. The reasons given by McGhee seem right and fair to me - they talk about the past and present of the United States well. The main reason I think so is the facts and numbers that support what she says - it's really hard to say that the US doesn't have big social and money problems because of racism.
