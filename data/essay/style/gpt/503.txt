Palliative care is crucial for enhancing the quality of life of seriously ill patients and their families. It offers a holistic approach to easing physical, emotional, and spiritual suffering, ensuring comfort and dignity throughout the care journey. Nevertheless, the challenges faced by Intermountain Healthcare (IH) in implementing palliative care services stem from the absence of a comprehensive policy that clearly outlines nursing responsibilities and provides detailed instructions for care teams. This essay aims to scrutinize the deficiencies in IH's current palliative care policy and explore the implications of this deficiency. Furthermore, it will advocate for the formulation of a detailed policy that caters effectively to the diverse needs of IH patients, drawing insights from relevant literature and research in the field.
