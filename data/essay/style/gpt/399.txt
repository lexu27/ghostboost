Lookism, the pervasive bias towards physical appearance, perpetuates the notion that success, power, and desirability are inherently linked to beauty. This bias fuels societal judgments and stereotypes, resulting in consequences like diminished self-esteem and limited opportunities.

In contrast, extreme body modification involves altering one's appearance through drastic measures like plastic surgery, tattoos, or piercings. Despite appearing different from lookism, both stem from the same unhealthy beauty standards. This pursuit can be viewed as a response to the societal pressure to conform to an unrealistic beauty ideal, prompting individuals to extreme measures in its pursuit.

The motivations behind both lookism and extreme body modification are deeply intertwined with societal expectations, especially for women. Women face relentless pressure to adhere to unrealistic beauty standards perpetuated by the media, creating a need to conform to an unattainable ideal. This pressure leads to heightened body dissatisfaction and a desire to undergo significant appearance changes.

Goode's book delves into the construction of beauty ideals and their impact on individuals who deviate from the norm. Society reinforces these ideals by prioritizing physical attractiveness, alienating those who do not meet these standards. Such societal pressures contribute to negative body image and an increase in extreme body modifications.

In essence, lookism and extreme body modification are interconnected phenomena rooted in unhealthy beauty standards prevalent in contemporary society. Both are products of societal pressures and expectations, particularly concerning women and perpetuated by various external influences. Goode's work underscores the harmful effects of these phenomena, underscoring the need for a shift towards inclusive, accepting, and healthy beauty standards in society.
