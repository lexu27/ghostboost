One effective strategy for the government involves promoting family planning and educating citizens on the significance of managing population growth. Through offering access to contraceptives and reproductive health services, individuals can confidently decide on their family size and prevent unintended pregnancies. Moreover, comprehensive sex education in schools and communities can dispel misconceptions, enabling responsible family planning.

Another crucial aspect is enhancing healthcare infrastructure, particularly in rural areas, to reduce factors prompting migration to cities for better medical facilities. Improved access to quality healthcare services can deter urban migration, fostering healthier lives within local communities and balancing population distribution across the country.

Furthermore, investing in diverse job opportunities in rural regions like agriculture and cottage industries can deter mass urban migration in pursuit of better economic prospects. This initiative not only retains individuals in rural areas but also fosters regional development, lessening the strain on urban resources.

Additionally, strict regulations on urban planning and land management are essential to curb urban sprawl. Designating development areas, preserving green spaces, and enforcing sustainable building practices can optimize resource utilization, minimize pollution, and enhance urban living conditions.

Lastly, enhancing public transportation systems and promoting eco-friendly modes of travel such as cycling and walking can mitigate traffic congestion and air pollution, elevating the city's livability. Incentives like discounted public transport fares and safe cycling infrastructure can further encourage sustainable transportation choices.

In conclusion, addressing urban overpopulation and its associated challenges necessitates comprehensive and proactive government action. Prioritizing family planning, healthcare access, rural development, urban planning, and sustainable transportation can foster balanced urban growth, combat environmental degradation, and uphold social well-being.
