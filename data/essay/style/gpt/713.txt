The Texas Board of Nursing (TBON) treats complaints against nurses with utmost seriousness, conducting thorough investigations. Recognizing the risks posed by impaired nurses with DWI charges, the board enforces a strict zero-tolerance policy towards drug and alcohol-related violations, deeming them as severe infractions. If found guilty of a DWI offense, a nurse's license may face suspension or revocation, with mandatory enrollment in a substance abuse program and monitoring for sobriety.

For nurses with a history of Medicaid fraud seeking a Texas license, the repercussions can be equally severe. Committed to safeguarding the public from healthcare fraud, the TBON subjects applications from those convicted of Medicaid fraud to rigorous scrutiny, potentially imposing restrictions upon licensure approval.

The TBON's anti-fraud policies aim to educate and rehabilitate nurses with prior Medicaid fraud convictions, mandating additional ethics and fraud prevention coursework. Supervisory oversight may also be required to guide the nurse through their rehabilitation journey.

Nurses confronting DWI charges or past Medicaid fraud convictions should promptly seek legal counsel and rehabilitation services. Collaboration with a knowledgeable attorney versed in TBON's disciplinary protocol can ensure protection of their rights through the process.

In summary, the repercussions for a registered nurse facing DWI charges during Texas' annual license renewal are significant. TBON's unwavering stance on drug and alcohol offenses, alongside strict measures for nurses with Medicaid fraud histories, underscores the gravity of the situation. Understanding TBON's disciplinary procedures and approach to substance abuse and fraud is imperative in navigating these potentially life-changing circumstances.
