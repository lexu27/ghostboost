Through detailed depictions of Agu’s emotional evolution, Okorafor portrays his gradual realization of the interconnectedness among all living beings. She writes, “He’d never felt like he’d belonged. And now, surrounded by these strange beings, he knew why – it was because he didn’t,” highlighting Agu’s newfound empathy and his recognition of belonging within a broader ecosystem. By intricately delineating Agu’s metamorphosis, Okorafor reinforces the novel’s core message, inspiring readers to embrace compassion and comprehension for both human and non-human entities.
