Introduction:
Traditionally, the field of Economics has revolved around the concept of boundless growth, exclusively quantified by Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Yet, Doughnut Economics, a theory introduced by economist Kate Raworth, disrupts this conventional wisdom by advocating for a new economic framework that tackles the pressing social and environmental issues of our era. This essay examines the author's perspective within the realm of Doughnut Economics and explores its importance in questioning established economic doctrines and educational practices.
