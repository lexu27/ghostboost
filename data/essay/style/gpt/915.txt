In her work titled I, Tituba, Black Witch of Salem, Maryse Condé presents a captivating narrative delving into the themes of patriarchy and racism within colonial society. Tituba, the protagonist, navigates the challenges posed by a patriarchal system and racial prejudices amidst the backdrop of the Salem witch trials. This analysis will explore the intricate ways in which these oppressive forces intertwine to shape Tituba's plight and eventual persecution.

The novel sheds light on the oppressive grip of patriarchy on characters like Tituba, emphasizing the constraints faced by women in a society dominated by white men. Tituba, a Black woman and enslaved individual, grapples with her lack of agency and vulnerability in decision-making processes. Her interactions with men underscore the patriarchal framework dictating her relationships, particularly in terms of controlling her sexuality and autonomy.

Tituba's encounters with figures like Reverend Parris and Reverend Hale exemplify the all-encompassing reach of patriarchy. Reverend Parris, for instance, imposes stringent expectations of obedience and submission on Tituba, reinforcing antiquated gender norms prevalent during that era. Her resistance to these norms exposes her to marginalization and mistreatment from both white individuals and women, underscoring the entwined nature of race and patriarchy.

Alongside patriarchy, Tituba confronts racism from the white colonizers due to her mixed African and Indigenous heritage. This heritage becomes a source of prejudice and discrimination, hindering her pursuit of independence. Tituba is viewed as an exotic "other," perpetuating her marginalization and confining her within racist stereotypes such as the "savage" or "witch doctor." Consequently, she is compelled to relinquish her cultural identity and assimilate into the dominant white culture.

Tituba's experiences with racism are epitomized through her complex relationship with Abigail Williams, a white woman. Despite Tituba's efforts to support and befriend Abigail, the latter's racist biases continually undermine their bond. Abigail perpetuates the stereotype of the cunning Black woman, exacerbating Tituba's marginalization and perpetuating the prevalent racist ideologies within colonial society.

The convergence of patriarchy and racism emerges prominently in Tituba's narrative during the Salem witch trials. Accused of witchcraft, Tituba's marginalization intensifies due to her gender and race. Her defiance against patriarchal norms is construed as witchcraft, with her assertion of sexual autonomy deemed a threat to societal conventions. Her racial background is exploited to stoke hysteria among the predominantly white populace, facilitating her scapegoating as the embodiment of their moral shortcomings.

In the face of unyielding persecution, Tituba's character evolves, showcasing her resilience and determination to challenge the oppressive structures of patriarchy and racism. Defying societal expectations, she harnesses her knowledge of magic and spirituality as a form of resistance. By exploring her Indigenous roots, Tituba offers an alternative narrative imbued with hope and fortitude in the face of adversity.

Maryse Condé skillfully intertwines the themes of patriarchy and racism in her novel I, Tituba, portraying the arduous journey and experiences of her protagonist. Tituba's story unveils the intricate web of oppressions endured by Black women in colonial society, highlighting the interconnected nature of patriarchy and racism that subjugate and marginalize individuals. Through this narrative, Condé urges readers to critically examine how historical accounts and societal structures have influenced the lives of marginalized groups while underscoring the potency of resilience and resistance in the face of hardship.
