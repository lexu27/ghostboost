Nozick posits that individuals hold the right to amass property through their labor and voluntary transactions, honoring their natural rights and autonomy. He argues that any wealth distribution stemming from these activities is just, respecting individuals' property rights and voluntary exchanges.

Contrary to the traditional view of economic justice centered on redistributive measures, Nozick advocates for a minimal state safeguarding individual rights without engaging in redistribution. Rejecting utilitarian justifications, he champions justice in holdings.

Nozick's theory underscores the significance of individual rights and economic freedom, empowering individuals to shape their economic destinies independently. It questions the state's role in wealth redistribution, asserting individuals' right to retain their earnings.

Moreover, Nozick's theory challenges the notion of economic justice tied to wealth redistribution, emphasizing the justice of a distribution's process over its resulting pattern, unlike Rawls' focus on reducing inequalities.

In essence, Nozick's entitlement theory disrupts traditional economic justice concepts, prioritizing individual rights and voluntary transactions. By upholding property rights and voluntary exchanges, Nozick advances a fair wealth distribution framework based on individual entitlements rather than egalitarian ideals.
