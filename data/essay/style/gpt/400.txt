The CALM Act of 2012, which targets the excessive loudness of TV commercials, has achieved some success in addressing this issue. It requires broadcasters to maintain uniform volume levels across programs and ads, leading to noticeable improvements for viewers who no longer need to adjust their volumes constantly during breaks. Additionally, the legislation grants the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) the power to enforce compliance, promoting accountability among broadcasters.

However, the CALM Act has its limitations. It solely pertains to TV commercials, excluding streaming services and online ads. This loophole enables advertisers to sidestep the regulations and air loud commercials through other platforms. Furthermore, the Act does not tackle excessively loud programs or content, which can still disrupt viewer experiences.

Amid the COVID-19 crisis, the surge in complaints regarding commercial volume suggests that advertisers have devised alternative tactics to evade the CALM Act. One such strategy involves the use of dynamic range compression techniques, which manipulate audio levels to maintain an overall lower volume while incorporating sharp spikes during crucial moments. This approach circumvents the Act by exploiting volume regulation technicalities.

In essence, while the CALM Act has made significant progress in controlling TV commercial volume, it faces challenges. Advertisers have adjusted to the Act's constraints, especially during the pandemic, by employing alternative methods to bypass the regulations. Therefore, policymakers must revisit and enhance the Act, extending its coverage to all advertising platforms and addressing other audio-related issues, to ensure a consistent and pleasant TV viewing experience for all.
