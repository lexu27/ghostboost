The global reach of the COVID-19 pandemic has left no corner untouched, with Kenya facing its own set of challenges. Among these, a troubling trend has surfaced â€“ a surge in adolescent pregnancies and dropouts among secondary school girls as a direct outcome of the lockdown measures. This analysis seeks to delve into the repercussions of these lockdowns on these rates, taking into account factors like the lack of active participation from health authorities, absence of comprehensive sex education, and the potential socio-economic aftermath. Additionally, it aims to scrutinize the recommendations put forth by Zulaika (2022) for combatting these issues and stress the significance of implementing interventions at a population level, while also pondering the implications on the general health and welfare of expectant teenage girls, as well as the enduring effects on the educational framework and the nation at large.
