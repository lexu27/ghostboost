The intricate bond shared by Alice and her mother in the film Every Secret Thing plays a crucial role in the unfolding events. Their relationship is deeply influenced by the mother complex and the mother archetype, paving the way for the tragic kidnappings and murders depicted in the narrative.

Alice's emotional ties with her mother are profoundly entwined, shaped by her mother's overprotective and dominating nature. This connection becomes apparent as Alice is released from prison, illustrating her longing for maternal affection and guidance.

On the other hand, the mother archetype embodies the universal understanding of motherhood, reflected in the interactions between Alice and her mother. While Alice's mother embodies the nurturing qualities expected of a maternal figure, her excessive control stifles Alice, leading to a resurgence of suppressed emotions and frustrations that fuel her past actions.

The influence of the mother complex and archetype on the unfolding events is evident in the power dynamics between Alice and her mother. Desperate for her mother's acknowledgment, Alice resorts to extreme measures to assert herself and seek validation. The kidnappings serve as a plea for attention and a bid for autonomy in her tumultuous relationship.

Moreover, the suffocating environment created by her mother's vigilance drives Alice towards rebellion and violence as a means of asserting her independence. The murders, therefore, can be perceived as a drastic attempt to break free from her mother's controlling influence.

In essence, the intricate emotional bond between Alice and her mother in Every Secret Thing intricately shapes the narrative, culminating in the harrowing events driven by Alice's quest for love and freedom amidst her mother's domineering demeanor.
