Moral universalism and moral relativism stand as contrasting theories in the realm of morality. The former asserts the existence of objective moral truths applicable to all, irrespective of cultural or individual perspectives, while the latter posits a subjective nature of moral principles that vary across cultures and individuals. From my perspective, moral universalism offers a more insightful comprehension of morality. Despite arguments favoring moral relativism, they ultimately circle back to the acknowledgment of a shared fundamental moral code and the significance of regulating human interactions.

Cultural diversity serves as a primary argument supporting moral relativism, suggesting that moral values are products of specific cultural, historical, and environmental contexts. While acknowledging varying moral customs among cultures, there exists a common moral code shared across them. For instance, the consensus against the wrongful killing of innocents prevails across diverse cultures, emphasizing the value placed on preserving human life.

Another common argument for moral relativism emphasizes individual subjectivity, asserting that moral values vary based on personal beliefs, emotions, and experiences. However, within this subjectivity, certain moral values are universally valued for fostering societal cohesion. Traits like honesty, trustworthiness, and fairness are universally esteemed across cultures for their role in building social trust and nurturing harmonious relationships.

Furthermore, the regulation of human relations and the establishment of a just society are deemed crucial by moral relativism. This recognition underscores the importance of moral principles in governing human behavior and safeguarding individuals' rights and well-being. The implementation of laws and social norms in societies aims to ensure equitable treatment and respect for all individuals, reflecting common ethical principles such as justice and equality.

In essence, while moral relativism accentuates the subjective aspect of morality, it ultimately leads back to moral universalism. The arguments supporting moral relativism underscore the existence of a shared moral core and the necessity of regulating human interactions. Moral universalism, with its recognition of objective moral truths transcending cultural boundaries, underscores the ethical significance in our engagements with others.
