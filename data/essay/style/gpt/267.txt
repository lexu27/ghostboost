Diana Kendall's essay "Framing Class, Vicarious Living, and Conspicuous Consumption" delves into the significant role played by the media in shaping societal perceptions of social class and perpetuating inequality. Through its portrayal of both the upper and lower classes, the media not only influences public opinion but also impacts human behavior, ultimately affecting the quality of life for those in the lower echelons of society.

The media often skews its depiction of the upper class, presenting them as elite, powerful, and glamorous figures. These idealized representations create a narrative of aspiration, normalizing the pursuit of wealth and material possessions. The opulent lifestyles showcased by the media fuel a desire for vicarious living, prompting individuals to emulate the values and standards set by the affluent. Consequently, the glorification of wealth serves to widen the gap between the haves and the have-nots.

Conversely, negative stereotypes of the lower class are frequently perpetuated by the media, portraying them as indolent, unintelligent, and deserving of their impoverished state. These biased depictions reinforce societal prejudices, fostering the notion that individuals from lower socioeconomic backgrounds are solely accountable for their financial standing. As a result, the media's portrayal of the lower class not only sustains social stigma but also exacerbates their marginalization, further hindering their prospects for advancement.

The influence of media representation transcends mere shaping of public sentiment to influencing human conduct. Kendall posits that individuals often strive to attain specific social statuses influenced by the media's delineation of class distinctions. This pursuit fosters a culture of conspicuous consumption, where material possessions are prized as symbols of status and accomplishment. Consequently, lower-class individuals, swayed by media narratives, may succumb to excessive spending and debt accumulation in their bid to keep pace with perceived status symbols.

The repercussions of media influence on the quality of life for lower-class individuals are profound. The emphasis on material wealth and conspicuous consumption propagated by the media places additional financial burdens on those in the lower strata of society. In prioritizing material acquisitions over investments in education, healthcare, or personal development, these individuals find their avenues for upward mobility further constricted, perpetuating the cycle of poverty.

In essence, the media plays a pivotal role in shaping societal perceptions of social class and perpetuating inequality. By portraying the upper class as aspirational and the lower class as inferior, the media not only molds public opinion but also impacts human behavior. These media-driven narratives foster a culture of conspicuous consumption, widening the economic disparity between the affluent and the impoverished, and negatively affecting the quality of life for those in the lower socioeconomic bracket. It is imperative for society to critically analyze the media's depiction of social class and strive to dismantle the stereotypes that uphold existing inequalities.
