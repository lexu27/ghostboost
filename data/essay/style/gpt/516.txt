The establishment and structure of Christian assemblies in ancient Greece bore the imprint of the Greek naming conventions prevailing over the Roman conventions. A multitude of factors intermingled to shape this evolution, encompassing linguistic, cultural, and religious dimensions.

Foremost among these influences was the pivotal role played by the Greek language in the diffusion of Christianity across ancient Greece. Widely spoken and comprehended in the Hellenistic sphere, which enveloped Greece and its environs, Greek served as the vessel for the New Testament, housing the teachings of Jesus Christ and the nascent Christian community. This linguistic milieu naturally permeated the nomenclature adopted by Christian congregations. As early adherents endeavored to intertwine their faith with the existing cultural tapestry, the usage of Greek appellations emerged as a fundamental tool for communication and identity construction.

Moreover, the cultural backdrop of ancient Greece predisposed the preservation of Greek names. Infused with a rich tapestry of mythology, philosophy, and literature, Greek names carried a weight of prestige and significance. The Greeks harbored the belief that names held sway over an individual's character and fate, and hence, the adoption of Greek names by Christian congregations enabled a linkage with the esteemed figures of Greek lore. Consequently, the Greek naming protocol acted as a conduit between ancient Greek culture and the burgeoning Christian movement, smoothing the assimilation and incorporation of Christianity into the societal framework.

Apart from linguistic and cultural considerations, the religious milieu of ancient Greece played a seminal role in cementing the supremacy of the Greek naming system. Woven with a pantheon of deities, each bearing distinct names and attributes, ancient Greek religion provided a fertile ground for Christian congregations to draw upon the religious familiarity and spiritual resonance associated with Greek nomenclature. This strategic maneuver facilitated the transition from indigenous religious customs to Christian teachings, allowing the early Christian communities to fuse their beliefs with the established religious traditions of Greece, thereby rendering Christianity more accessible and relatable to the wider populace.

In sum, the ascendancy of the Greek naming convention over the Roman counterpart in shaping ancient Christian assemblies in Greece stemmed from a confluence of factors. The linguistic hegemony of Greek, the cultural cachet linked to Greek names, and the religious framework of ancient Greece all coalesced to mold this outcome. Through the adoption of the Greek naming system, early Christian communities forged a sense of belonging, effectively communicated their doctrines, and integrated their faith within the broader cultural and religious matrix. This confluence catalyzed the propagation and embrace of Christianity in ancient Greece, laying the groundwork for the enduring influence of the Greek naming system in Christian congregations.
