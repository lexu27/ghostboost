Drug abuse and criminal behavior in high school settings present significant challenges to students' well-being and the safety of educational environments. To address these issues effectively, it is crucial to understand the root causes of such behaviors and involve parents in combating drug abuse and criminal activities among adolescents. This essay aims to explore the Differential Association Theory, which suggests that interactions with individuals engaging in unlawful behaviors can influence the adoption of criminal activities. By analyzing this theory in the context of high school students, we seek to propose strategies for educational interventions and parental engagement, contributing to a holistic approach to addressing these pressing concerns.
