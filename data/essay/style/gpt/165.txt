The eruption of the Second World War marked a calamitous event that engulfed nations across the globe. Delving into the realm of historical conjecture lies the question of whether the United States, with its isolationist foreign policy and restricted economic sway in the 1930s, could have averted this catastrophe. Despite its limitations, the US held certain tools that, if wielded differently, might have impacted the war's course.

1. The Doctrine of Isolation:
Throughout the 1930s, the United States embraced a robust isolationist stance, propelled by a fervent desire to sidestep entanglements in foreign disputes. Nonetheless, this stance curtailed its participation in global matters, impeding its ability to stave off the outbreak of World War II. The nation's reluctance to intervene in international conflicts like Japan's 1931 incursion into Manchuria or Hitler's European aggressions undermined its clout and capacity to act as a deterrent against further hostilities.

2. Constricted Economic Clout:
Amidst the 1930s, the United States grappled with the Great Depression, which severely undercut its economic standing on the global platform. The nation's economic constraints translated to a dearth of financial leverage to effectively intercede in conflicts and exert substantial influence over international affairs.

3. Squandered Opportunities:
Despite the shackles of isolationism and limited economic sway, the United States did encounter missed chances to contain the war. For instance, the US could have affiliated with the League of Nations, a collective security body established post-World War I, yet opted against it. Had the United States been an active participant, it could have collectively countered aggressive nations, potentially dissuading the war's eruption.

4. The Ripple Effect of an Altered Approach:
Had the United States pursued a more interventionist foreign policy and harnessed its economic might to bolster allied nations, it might have steered the events leading to World War II. Enhanced involvement in global affairs and economic reinforcement of imperiled nations could have enfeebled the Axis powers and conceivably halted their military expansion.

Epilogue:
Despite the significant constraints imposed by the United States' isolationist foreign policy and limited economic leverage in the 1930s, the nation harbored the latent ability to avert the onset of the Second World War. Through alternative strategies such as active engagement in the League of Nations, extending greater support to imperiled nations, and diplomatic dialogues with aggressor states, the US could have potentially made a discernible impact. In the grand tapestry of events that led to World War II, the causative factors were manifold, rendering it arduous to pinpoint a singular element that could have entirely deterred its occurrence.
