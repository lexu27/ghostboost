Nevertheless, the recognition that their youth is waning and they may have limited time left to pursue their passions can trigger a mid-life crisis.

Moreover, societal anticipations and cultural standards play a pivotal role in the emergence of a mid-life crisis. Throughout their lifetimes, individuals are inundated with messages regarding what they ought to accomplish, the milestones they should attain, and the epitomes of success. Yet, upon reaching middle age, they may discover that these societal yardsticks are not as gratifying as they once appeared. The realization that they have been adhering to a trajectory delineated by others can evoke feelings of emptiness and provoke a reevaluation of their choices.
