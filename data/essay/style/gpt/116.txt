In recent years, companies have increasingly resorted to unethical and inappropriate methods when dealing with layoffs. Take, for instance, the case of Etihad Airways, where corporate social responsibility and fair treatment were blatantly ignored during the restructuring. This discussion asserts that had employees been more involved in decision-making, such misguided actions could have been averted. It will delve into how employee engagement influences performance, job security, and motivation.

To begin with, granting employees a role in decision-making fosters open communication and transparency. When employees participate in decision-making, they feel valued and are more inclined to share their insights and suggestions. In the scenario of Etihad Airways, involving employees in decision-making could have led to alternative solutions to layoffs, such as cost-saving strategies or resource reallocation.

Furthermore, employee involvement in decision-making nurtures a sense of ownership over outcomes, translating into heightened motivation and dedication. By engaging employees in decision-making, Etihad Airways could have inspired its workforce to collaboratively tackle challenges rather than resorting to unethical practices like discriminatory layoffs.

Additionally, employee engagement positively influences performance as employees who are engaged and have a say in decisions are likely to go above and beyond in their roles. This is due to the feeling of responsibility and pride in their work, knowing that their contributions are valued. By overlooking employee involvement and opting for unethical layoff practices, Etihad Airways not only tarnished its reputation but also missed out on the valuable insights its employees could have offered.

Moreover, involving employees in decision-making promotes job security as it instills trust in the company's decisions. This trust creates a positive work atmosphere and alleviates concerns about job stability. In the case of Etihad Airways, including employees in decision-making could have provided them with a clearer understanding of the company's challenges and the need for layoffs, potentially leading to suggestions for minimizing the impact on job security.

Lastly, neglecting corporate social responsibility and engaging in discriminatory practices during restructuring can have grave repercussions. Such actions not only harm the company's reputation but also breed discontent among employees, fostering a toxic work environment. Discriminatory layoffs erode trust and loyalty, resulting in decreased productivity and higher turnover rates. Additionally, companies that fail to uphold ethical standards may face legal ramifications, regulatory scrutiny, and financial penalties.

In conclusion, enhanced employee involvement in decision-making could have averted Etihad Airways' unethical approach to layoffs. Employee engagement has a positive impact on performance, job security, and motivation. Neglecting corporate social responsibility and engaging in discriminatory practices during restructuring can prove detrimental to companies. Recognizing the value of employees' contributions and involving them in decision-making is essential for ensuring ethical and relevant responses to challenges like layoffs.
