In recent times, the issue of overcrowding in prisons has raised significant concerns in various global regions. This problem presents a multitude of challenges, straining infrastructure and resources while also raising humanitarian issues related to confining inmates in densely packed facilities. California, a state long plagued by prison overcrowding, implemented an innovative prison reform legislation named Realignment. This piece of writing sets out to assess the efficacy of Realignment in addressing prison overcrowding, analyzing its effects on humanitarian concerns, repercussions, and the accessibility of justice. By delving into the detention conditions beyond mere inmate numbers, this study aims to bridge existing gaps and explore the potential feasibility of reducing prison populations in other regions facing similar dilemmas.
