Ethnocentrism, the belief in one's ethnic or cultural superiority, often leads to the judgment of other groups by one's own standards. This notion significantly impacts cultural comprehension, resulting in misunderstandings, stereotypes, and misinterpretations as seen in Trevor Noah's work, Born a Crime. 

Noah's memoir delves into his upbringing in apartheid-era South Africa, where the ramifications of ethnocentrism were palpable. Racial divisions were stark, and Noah, being of mixed heritage, faced condemnation merely for his existence. Such ethnocentric ideologies fueled segregation and bias, impeding cultural empathy and inclusivity.

The dynamics of ethnocentrism are also evident in the dynamics between developed and developing nations. Developed countries often perceive themselves as superior due to economic or technological progress, fostering stereotypes and misconceptions about developing nations. This impedes cultural empathy and collaboration.

Western media frequently portrays developing nations in a manner that overlooks their cultural richness and potential, perpetuating misconceptions and hindering authentic understanding and collaboration between societies. 

Moreover, ethnocentrism influences the perception of leaders from different cultures, impacting international relations and viewpoints. Leaders may be assessed through one's cultural lens, leading to biased interpretations and misunderstandings. 

In essence, ethnocentrism profoundly affects cultural understanding, fostering misunderstandings, stereotypes, and misconceptions across diverse societies. Trevor Noah's Born a Crime underscores the adverse effects of ethnocentrism in apartheid-era South Africa. Additionally, ethnocentrism perpetuates stereotypes and misconceptions between developed and developing nations, hindering genuine collaboration and understanding. Furthermore, the perception of leaders from varying cultures can sway international relations and viewpoints, potentially leading to biased judgments and misunderstandings. Overcoming ethnocentrism and nurturing cultural understanding are vital for bridging gaps between cultures and fostering harmonious international relationships.
