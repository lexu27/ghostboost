Introduction:

Amid the ongoing global challenge posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, a critical examination of the governmental response becomes imperative, particularly concerning marginalized groups like the homeless. This essay delves into the governmental actions undertaken in Maricopa County, spotlighted in O'Connor Meg's article "Maricopa County Moved Homeless People to Sweltering Parking Lots in Response to COVID-19". Through an exploration of the repercussions stemming from these measures, we aim to evaluate their efficacy, pondering whether alternative avenues, such as enhanced social support for the homeless, might have been a more judicious course of action.
