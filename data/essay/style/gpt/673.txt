Genghis Khan and Hulagu, key figures in the Mongol Empire, embraced divergent strategies in their conquests, especially concerning their treatment of conquered lands and leaders. Genghis Khan, renowned for his tactical brilliance, aimed to forge a vast empire blending diverse cultures harmoniously. Rather than obliterating conquered territories outright, he fostered cultural exchange and religious liberty. Recognizing the benefits of incorporating varied civilizations' knowledge and abilities, Genghis Khan established a governance system enabling conquered rulers to maintain authority under his suzerainty by pledging allegiance and paying tribute. Through this assimilative strategy, Genghis Khan effectively merged different cultures, faiths, and customs into the Mongol Empire.

On the contrary, Hulagu, Genghis Khan's grandson, employed a more brutal stance in his conquests. When the Mongols seized territories like Baghdad and other Islamic regions, they enforced a policy of utter destruction. Hulagu's troops massacred populations, razed libraries, and obliterated architecture, reducing once-proud cities to ruins. Unlike Genghis Khan, Hulagu disregarded the significance of cultural exchange and religious diversity. Viewing conquered territories as sources of wealth, he aimed to exploit them, leading to widespread suffering and devastation.

The marked contrast between Genghis Khan and Hulagu’s tactics can be traced back to their differing motivations and circumstances. Genghis Khan pursued stability and expansion through collaboration, understanding the advantages of assimilating various cultures and systems. Conversely, Hulagu's actions were primarily motivated by amassing wealth and upholding his religious convictions. Under Hulagu’s reign, the Mongols adhered strictly to their religion, seeking to eliminate any dissenting viewpoints.

In summary, Genghis Khan and Hulagu pursued opposing paths in their conquests, particularly in their treatment of conquered territories and rulers. While Genghis Khan emphasized assimilation and cultural acceptance, Hulagu resorted to destruction and tyranny. These varying approaches stemmed from their motivations, with Genghis Khan prioritizing stability and collaboration, and Hulagu driven by wealth accumulation and religious beliefs. Ultimately, these strategies shaped the enduring legacies of both leaders within the Mongol Empire.
