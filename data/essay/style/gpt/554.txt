Introduction:
The transformative power of education is widely recognized for its role in fostering personal development, enabling social advancement, and enhancing the fabric of societies at large. Nevertheless, a troubling truth persists across numerous communities worldwide, where specific groups of students, particularly those grappling with learning differences and individuals from marginalized racial backgrounds, confront an elevated risk of entrapment within the school-to-prison pipeline.
