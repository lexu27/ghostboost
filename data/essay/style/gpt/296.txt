Gustave Moreau, a renowned symbolist painter from the late 19th century, crafted a masterpiece in his work "Jupiter and Semele." This captivating piece beckons viewers to immerse themselves in the realm of mythology, delving into the symbolism and themes portrayed within. Specifically, the painting sheds light on the distinctions between humanity and divinity, illuminating the contrasting attributes and repercussions associated with each domain.

In the narrative depicted in "Jupiter and Semele," drawn from Greek mythology, Jupiter, the supreme deity, manifests before Semele, a mortal woman who holds his affection. The artwork captures the poignant moment when Jupiter unveils his true divine essence to Semele, who is unable to endure the overwhelming spectacle and is ultimately engulfed by the divine flames of his revelation. Moreau's adept use of symbolism and meticulous attention to detail lend a profound complexity to this tragic tale.

A key motif illustrated in the painting is the dichotomy between mortals and gods, accentuated by Moreau through his portrayal of the characters. Jupiter is presented as a commanding figure, draped in opulent robes symbolizing his authority and magnificence. His robust physique and regal posture exude power and dominance. Conversely, Semele is depicted as delicate and susceptible, her form and countenance delicately rendered to reflect her human essence. This juxtaposition in their physical attributes underscores the disparity between the realms of the divine and the terrestrial.

Beyond mere appearances, Moreau employs various symbolic elements to underscore the divergence between humanity and divinity. The most prominent symbol in the painting is the divine fire that consumes Semele, signifying the destructive potency of Jupiter's divine nature. The flames also embody passion and longing, representing the fatal outcomes of intertwining mortal and divine domains. They serve as a poignant reminder of the boundaries humans encounter when encountering the divine.

Moreover, the intricate background details emphasize the distinction in the environments inhabited by mortals and deities. The space surrounding Semele is a modest chamber, devoid of embellishments and enclosed by simple walls. This stark setting further underscores her humanity and the confines of her existence. In contrast, the backdrop behind Jupiter is a celestial expanse, featuring clouds and ethereal illumination. This backdrop serves as a visual representation of Jupiter's divine realm, accentuating the gap between human and divine realms.

Another theme explored in "Jupiter and Semele" delves into the repercussions of transgressing the boundaries between mortals and gods. Semele's tragic fate is a direct consequence of her yearning to witness Jupiter's divine form in its entirety. The calamity unfolds as she persists in her desire to behold him in his full glory, heedless of Jupiter's warnings about the incapacity of mortals to endure such a sight. Driven by her aspirations and thirst for transcendence, she falls prey to her own inquisitiveness.

Moreau's portrayal of Semele's fatal ambition serves as a stark reminder of the inherent constraints of the human condition. It intimates that humans, despite their aspirations for eternal life or divine knowledge, must acknowledge their mortal essence. The painting acts as a cautionary narrative, delineating the ramifications of surpassing the human sphere and confronting the ire of the gods.

In sum, Gustave Moreau's painting "Jupiter and Semele" initiates a discourse on the distinctions between mortals and deities. Through astute application of symbolism and meticulous craftsmanship, Moreau captures the divergent attributes and repercussions linked with each realm. The painting stands as a testament to the limitations humans confront when engaging with the divine, showcasing the tragic outcomes of breaching boundaries. "Jupiter and Semele" stands as a testament to Moreau's prowess as a symbolist painter, inspiring contemplation on the intrinsic variances between humanity and divinity.
