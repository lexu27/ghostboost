In Adorno's concept of industrial culture, media products for children are viewed as extensions of capitalist values. Adorno contends that these products, such as children's TV programs and films, are crafted primarily to yield profits for corporations. They foster consumerism and prompt children to adopt a passive consumer role in a capitalist environment. This view aligns with the Marxist criticism of capitalism.

An illustrative instance of media products bolstering capitalist values is evident in the profusion of merchandise linked to popular children's franchises. For example, the success of animated movies like the "Frozen" series transcends mere box office earnings. It encompasses a broad array of products, including toys, attire, and accessories. These items are designed not only for children's entertainment but also to stimulate demand for consumer goods. The media has a pivotal role in shaping children's wants and preferences, intentionally advancing consumer culture.

Contrary to Adorno's standpoint, structural functionalism posits that media products for children serve a more favorable purpose in society. According to this perspective, these products cater to children's developmental and educational requirements, offering them engaging and enlightening content. For instance, educational programs like "Sesame Street" have garnered acclaim for their ability to nurture learning and social growth in children. Furthermore, the media contributes to societal cohesion by furnishing cultural narratives and shared experiences.

While acknowledging the influence of capitalism on media production, structural functionalism places emphasis on the positive social benefits of these media products. This viewpoint tends to highlight the potential advantages for children's development and the fostering of social unity.

In summary, media products for children do indeed reinforce capitalist values to a considerable extent, aligning with Adorno's concept of industrial culture. Instances such as the promotional merchandise associated with popular children's franchises underscore the materialistic foundation of these products. However, the perspective of structural functionalism presents a more sanguine outlook, underscoring the educational and unifying dimensions of media products. Although both perspectives acknowledge capitalist influences in media creation, they diverge in their assessment of the overall societal and child-centric impact.
