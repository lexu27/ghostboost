The proliferation of digital technology and the forces of globalization pose formidable obstacles to safeguarding and overseeing intellectual property (IP) assets. The conventional centralized approaches have demonstrated their inadequacies in upholding the rights of creators and innovators amidst a borderless realm. Nonetheless, the emergence of blockchain technology heralds a potential transformation in the globalization of IP. Through its decentralized architecture, blockchain presents novel solutions that have the capacity to reshape the landscape of intellectual property protection, administration, and commercialization. This exposition seeks to delve into the promise of blockchain technology, the role of its decentralized framework in safeguarding and managing IP, and the advantages and drawbacks it brings within the realm of globalization.
