A crucial element in safeguarding individuals during emergencies is the presence of a thorough disaster preparedness strategy. This strategy encompasses the coordination and execution of measures to mitigate the effects of disasters, ensuring swift response and recovery. Integral to such a strategy is the assembly of an emergency preparedness kit, containing essential items to assist individuals in managing the immediate aftermath of a disaster. Furthermore, maintaining composure in crisis situations is paramount, as it can significantly influence survival rates.

During a disaster, an emergency preparedness kit serves as a vital resource, offering individuals essential provisions. As outlined by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), this kit should include water, non-perishable food, a flashlight, batteries, a first aid kit, and a weather radio (FEMA, 2019). These provisions are crucial for sustaining individuals when access to basic necessities is limited following a disaster. Additionally, the American Red Cross suggests including items such as medications, personal hygiene products, and important documents (American Red Cross, 2021). By incorporating these components into an emergency preparedness kit, individuals are better equipped to meet their fundamental needs, thereby enhancing their chances of survival.

The ability to remain composed during emergencies can significantly impact survival outcomes. In times of crisis, individuals often grapple with fear and panic, which can impede rational decision-making. According to a study featured in the International Journal of Emergency Mental Health, maintaining a calm demeanor enables individuals to think clearly and respond appropriately (Ruzek et al., 2012). Panic and fear may lead to risky behaviors or hinder individuals from adhering to safety protocols, jeopardizing their own safety and that of others. Thus, cultivating a composed mindset is essential for ensuring personal safety and facilitating effective responses in emergency situations.

Research conducted by the American Psychological Association (APA) underscores the importance of maintaining composure during emergencies. Through a series of studies, APA found that individuals who remained calm and collected during disasters exhibited higher levels of preparedness, improved decision-making capabilities, and a greater likelihood of taking essential safety measures (APA, 2018). Moreover, staying calm can aid individuals in maintaining a positive outlook, managing stress, and providing support to those in distress. These factors contribute to overall well-being and heighten the prospects of survival in emergency scenarios.

In summary, a comprehensive disaster preparedness plan is indispensable for safeguarding individuals during emergencies. Such a plan encompasses the creation of an emergency preparedness kit, housing essential components that furnish individuals with vital resources. Furthermore, the ability to maintain composure during emergencies plays a pivotal role in decision-making, adherence to safety measures, and overall well-being. Evidence from FEMA, the American Red Cross, and cited sources underscores the criticality of both a comprehensive disaster preparedness plan and the significance of remaining composed in bolstering survival rates during emergencies.
