Khoshaim et al. conducted a study titled "Anxiety level of university students during COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia" to investigate the effects of the pandemic on the mental well-being of university students in Saudi Arabia, specifically focusing on anxiety levels. The study involved a survey administered to 500 university students, addressing aspects such as anxiety symptoms, COVID-19 fears, and the pandemic's impact on their academic and social spheres.

Results indicated a considerable number of university students in Saudi Arabia experienced heightened anxiety levels during the COVID-19 crisis. Factors such as the fear of contracting the virus, uncertainties about the future, disruptions in academic routines, and reduced social interactions all contributed to these elevated anxiety levels. Notably, female students reported higher anxiety levels compared to their male peers.

This research enhances our comprehension of how the pandemic affects the mental health of students in Saudi Arabia. By focusing on the unique context of Saudi Arabian university students, it expands the existing literature on the psychological repercussions of the pandemic within diverse cultural and socioeconomic contexts. Furthermore, the findings emphasize the necessity of tailored interventions and support services for university students to effectively manage their anxiety levels.

Recognizing the impact of the pandemic on students' mental well-being is crucial for policymakers and educators alike. This knowledge equips them to formulate appropriate strategies and interventions to alleviate the negative effects of the pandemic on students' welfare. By acknowledging the specific anxieties faced by university students in Saudi Arabia, this study lays the groundwork for customized support systems that can address the distinct challenges encountered by this demographic.
