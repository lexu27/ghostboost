The epic Beowulf is renowned for its vivid portrayal of heroic men and their daring deeds, yet it is equally infamous for marginalizing women to supporting roles, employing them as mere tools to propel the narrative centered around men. When scrutinizing the representation of gender dynamics in Beowulf, it becomes apparent that women are depicted as passive and subservient, their worth contingent upon their marital status.

Within the Anglo-Saxon era, women were expected to adhere to specific societal roles. Often viewed as commodities, they were transferred from father to husband upon marriage, their value intricately linked to their capacity to bear offspring and perpetuate their husband's lineage. This societal norm is unequivocally mirrored in the poem, portraying figures like Wealhtheow and Hildeburh as instruments utilized to secure alliances and foster peace, their presence marked by silence, speaking only in accordance with societal norms.

The influence of marriage on women's perceived value reverberates throughout the narrative. Wealhtheow, for instance, is illustrated as a symbol of status bestowed upon King Hrothgar to fortify political ties. Her role as a gracious hostess involves ensuring guest comfort and enabling diplomatic exchanges. Though admired for her beauty and organizational skills, her value is superficially appraised, her significance confined to her function as a peacekeeper and progenitor of heirs.

Likewise, Hildeburh emerges as a tragic character, manipulated through marriage to cement an alliance between warring factions. Tragedy befalls her as her husband and brother meet their demise in a violent clash, leaving her bereaved and isolated. Hildeburh is depicted as a figure of sorrow, a vessel of grief utilized to underscore the toll of conflict, devoid of autonomy or agency.

In summary, Beowulf's portrayal of gender roles underscores women's peripheral status and their instrumentalization as narrative devices. The societal expectations imposed on women during the Anglo-Saxon era significantly shaped their depiction in the poem, with their value predominantly linked to marriageability and fulfillment of societal duties rather than individual autonomy or contributions. It is imperative to critically assess this representation and acknowledge the pressing need for equitable portrayals of women in both literature and society.
