Beyond critiquing European colonialism, Guaman Poma offers a blueprint for a just governance system that ensures equitable treatment and representation for indigenous communities. He envisions a framework where indigenous leaders wield influence in governance and decision-making processes, challenging entrenched European beliefs in superiority and championing the integration of indigenous viewpoints and experiences into the political domain.

In essence, Guaman Poma's manuscript emerges as a potent instrument in dismantling European legitimizations of colonialism. By laying bare the stark realities of colonial injustices and advocating for indigenous self-determination and political participation, he presents a compelling counter-narrative to European hegemony.
