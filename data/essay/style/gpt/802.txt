The dominance of whiteness as the standard in the realms of film, television, and media has persisted as a prominent concern within our societal framework. Though strides have been taken to showcase a variety of viewpoints and storylines, the journey ahead remains extensive. The perpetual normalization of whiteness has wielded a substantial influence on how race and identity are perceived, fostering a skewed comprehension and uneven portrayal. A beneficial approach to dissecting this quandary involves an examination of the film "Get Out" and other noteworthy pieces that illuminate this phenomenon.

Directed by Jordan Peele, "Get Out" stands as a groundbreaking horror film that plunges into the Black experience in America. The narrative shadows Chris Washington, an African-American gentleman, during his sojourn to his white girlfriend's family abode. This cinematic gem adeptly dissects the systemic racism and nuanced microaggressions encountered by individuals of color within predominantly white domains. By interjecting an African-American perspective into a genre traditionally dominated by white narratives, "Get Out" confronts the conventional depiction of whiteness in the cinematic realm.

A notable portrayal in the movie is that of Rose Armitage, Chris's romantic partner. Initially cast as a well-intentioned, progressive white woman with a compassionate stance on racial matters, the facade she presents begins to unravel progressively, unveiling her malevolent intentions. This depiction challenges the prevalent stereotype of white saviors and allies, who are frequently cast as the moral compasses in narratives involving individuals of color. By subverting this archetype, "Get Out" accentuates the perils of presuming well-meaning whiteness.

Another cinematic piece that sheds light on the default positioning of whiteness is "The Dark Knight." While not explicitly addressing race, the treatment of Harvey Dent's character is telling. Harvey Dent, a white figure, is depicted as a public hero, with his descent serving as a pivotal narrative juncture. Conversely, Lucius Fox, portrayed by Morgan Freeman, assumes the role of the voice of rationale and ethical guidance from the sidelines. This subtle portrayal reinforces the notion that authority and heroism are intrinsically linked to whiteness, relegating individuals of color to ancillary roles.

Furthermore, the portrayal of whiteness as the norm in media transcends mere casting decisions and character portrayals. It envelops the overarching narratives and plotlines that predominantly revolve around white perspectives. For example, in romantic comedies, the central love stories often revolve around white protagonists, relegating romantic entanglements involving individuals of color to secondary or exoticized subplots. This perpetuates the notion that love and romance are predominantly the domain of white individuals, marginalizing other racial identities.

The repercussions of such skewed depictions are profound. They establish and reinforce a racial hierarchy, where whiteness is heralded as the epitome of beauty, success, and normalcy. These distorted perceptions have severe implications for individuals of color, who frequently internalize these skewed representations, fostering feelings of inferiority and inadequacy. Moreover, the limited representation of diverse backgrounds perpetuates stereotypes, misconceptions, and even racism, as audiences are deprived of a broad spectrum of perspectives and experiences.

Nevertheless, it is imperative to acknowledge the strides made in recent times. Films such as "Moonlight" and "Black Panther" have shattered records and garnered critical acclaim, underscoring the demand for multifaceted narratives. These cinematic creations offer nuanced portrayals of Black stories and identities, challenging preconceived notions of whiteness as the default standard. Additionally, movements like "#OscarsSoWhite" have cast a spotlight on the dearth of diversity in Hollywood, sparking heightened discussions on representation and inclusivity.

In conclusion, the perpetuation of whiteness as the default in film, television, and media has wielded a substantial influence on how race and identity are perceived. The inclination to center narratives around white figures, coupled with the limited representation of diverse backgrounds, perpetuates existing disparities and reinforces detrimental stereotypes. Nonetheless, recent works like "Get Out" and "Moonlight" have paved the way for a more inclusive narrative, instigating dialogues on representation. It is imperative for filmmakers, audiences, and industry gatekeepers to persist in challenging the default narrative of whiteness, fostering a media landscape that is more equitable and diverse.
