Throughout the annals of time, the emergence of states in Western Europe, China, the Islamic World, and India has been profoundly swayed by social tactics of authority. These stratagems wielded a pivotal influence in molding the political terrain of these realms, ultimately culminating in the inception of potent and enduring states.

In the realm of Western Europe, the feudal paradigm exerted a momentous impact on the evolution of states. Within this structure, authority was diffused and held by local barons, who swore fealty to a superior lord in exchange for safeguarding and provisions. This system laid the groundwork for governance, facilitating the centralization of authority and the formation of nation-states like England and France. Moreover, the ascent of formidable monarchies in Western Europe, employing diverse social maneuvers such as power centralization and bureaucratic frameworks, further cemented the state-building process.

In China, the establishment of states bore the indelible imprint of the Confucian societal hierarchy. The stress on filial piety and deference for authority fostered social harmony and enabled the consolidation of power under a robust central administration. The concept of the Mandate of Heaven, bestowing legitimacy upon rulers, proved instrumental in the creation of states like the Qin and Han dynasties. Furthermore, the civil service examination system grounded in Confucian precepts facilitated the recruitment of competent officials who upheld stability and advanced the state's interests.

Across the Islamic World, the formation of states was guided by the tenets of Islamic jurisprudence and the Caliphate system. The Caliphate, originally instituted by the Prophet Muhammad, served as a central governing body and played a pivotal role in unification and governance of Islamic territories. Stratagems of authority, such as erecting a robust military and fostering commercial endeavors, propelled the expansion of Islamic states' influence and ensured stability.

In India, the caste system wielded a significant impact in the establishment of states. The stratified social order provided a blueprint for governance and delineated a distinct power hierarchy. For instance, the Mauryan Empire harnessed the caste system to consolidate power and streamline the administration of an expansive realm.

To conclude, the import of social power strategies in state formation is immeasurable. The feudal system in Western Europe, the Confucian social hierarchy in China, the Caliphate system in the Islamic World, and the caste system in India all played pivotal roles in shaping political frameworks and laying the groundwork for robust states. These social tactics facilitated power consolidation, preservation of social order, and implementation of efficient governance structures.
