Social isolation has become a prevalent concern in our contemporary society, with the proliferation of technology leading to a shift towards virtual interactions over face-to-face engagements. This shift has resulted in diminished social ties, heightened feelings of loneliness, and increased isolation. Despite these challenges, researchers have been exploring diverse approaches to alleviate the adverse impacts of social isolation. One promising avenue of exploration is exercise. Through a study conducted by Cho et al. (2017), the effects of treadmill exercise on depression in socially isolated rat pups were investigated. This discourse will delve into the study's methodologies, outcomes, and its implications for comprehending the influence of exercise on emotional and behavioral alterations induced by social isolation.
