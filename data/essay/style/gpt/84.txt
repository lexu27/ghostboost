Restaurant tipping customs are a multi-faceted phenomenon shaped by a myriad of elements like the quality of cuisine, the server's gender, the size of the dining group, and the familiarity between patrons and staff. These factors can all sway the percentage left behind as a gratuity for the server.

Undoubtedly, the quality of the food serves as a pivotal determinant in the calculus of tipping percentages. Patrons who revel in their meal's flavor and presentation are more inclined to be liberal with their tips. Conversely, subpar cuisine might result in a diminished gratuity or even no tip at all. Thus, the caliber of the fare wields substantial influence over tipping conduct.

The server's gender also exerts a discernible effect on gratuities. Research indicates that male servers often rake in more substantial tips than their female peers. This discrepancy could stem from prejudiced perceptions regarding service quality or societal norms favoring men in traditionally client-facing roles. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that this gender bias has been gradually waning as society becomes more attuned to such prejudices.

The size of the dining party stands as another pivotal factor. Larger groups tend to allocate a smaller fraction of the bill as a tip in comparison to more intimate gatherings. This trend may be attributed to the heightened attention necessitated by larger parties, with patrons potentially viewing the extra effort as part of the server's job rather than an exceptional service deserving of a higher gratuity.

Moreover, the level of acquaintance between patrons and staff impacts tipping behavior. Regular clientele who frequent a restaurant are prone to leave a more generous tip for the server, possibly owing to an established rapport or an admiration for the service provided. Conversely, first-time visitors may exhibit more caution or be less acquainted with the server's capabilities, resulting in a less substantial gratuity.

Regarding the deployment of personalized notes on the back of dining bills as an independent variable, there exist both merits and demerits. A personalized message has the potential to foster a positive customer experience, enhance engagement, and conceivably influence the tip amount. Nevertheless, it is imperative to take into account individual disparities in how patrons respond to such messages, as some may perceive them as authentic gestures while others might view them as contrived or disingenuous.

To bolster the robustness of the study's design and execution, several enhancements can be implemented. Primarily, employing a larger and more diverse sample pool of patrons would render the findings more broadly applicable. Furthermore, factoring in confounding variables such as patrons' income levels could furnish a more precise comprehension of each factor's impact on tipping behavior.

Furthermore, diversifying the study across various restaurant settings (e.g., upscale dining establishments, casual eateries) and cultural milieus would offer a more holistic view of tipping customs. Lastly, scrutinizing additional variables such as the server's demeanor, communication prowess, and the overall dining experience could furnish a more nuanced insight into tipping behavior beyond the enumerated factors.

In summation, tipping practices in restaurants are subject to numerous influences, including food quality, server gender, dining party size, and customer familiarity. While personalized notes on dining bills could potentially sway tipping conduct, their efficacy may fluctuate among patrons. Enhancing the credibility of exploring restaurant tipping culture necessitates considerations like larger sample sizes, the control of confounding variables, and the examination of supplementary factors. Only through comprehensive and meticulous inquiry can we further comprehend, address, and potentially refine tipping conventions in the restaurant sector.
