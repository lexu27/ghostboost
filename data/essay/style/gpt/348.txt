Lady Mary Wroth delves into profound themes of love, loss, and identity in her sonnet "In this strange labyrinth." Critiquing societal constraints on women during the Renaissance, she uses the labyrinth as a metaphor for suffocation and entrapment. Religious allusions thread through the poem, portraying the speaker's search for love as a spiritual and emotional journey towards liberation.

The title, "In this strange labyrinth," hints at confusion and disorientation. Society's norms are likened to a complex maze in the Renaissance, a restrictive and perplexing structure. The labyrinth symbolizes the suffocating constraints on women, with words like "thick grown," "dark," and "turnings" intensifying feelings of claustrophobia and entrapment.

Love intertwines with identity in the sonnet. The loss of love impacts the speaker's ability to establish her identity, likening her heart to a "blown rose" withered by love's absence. This loss extends beyond romance, reflecting the loss of personal agency as women were expected to devote themselves entirely to men. Imagery like the "blown rose" and "faded leaves" underscores the devaluation of the speaker's desires and aspirations.

In the labyrinth, the speaker yearns for true love, finding solace in a religious allusion. Beyond societal norms, she seeks true love, suggesting it comes from a higher power, transcending societal expectations. This pursuit is likened to a religious pilgrimage, emphasizing love's spiritual nature.

The religious allusion also hints that true love is a quest for liberation, referencing Theseus and Ariadne's story. Ariadne sacrifices her happiness for Theseus, echoing society's expectation for women to sacrifice their autonomy. This allusion serves as an allegory for the speaker's struggle against societal constraints.

Wroth's sonnet navigates themes of love, loss, and identity in the Renaissance, using the labyrinth as a metaphor for suffocating societal constraints on women. Religious allusions elevate the speaker's search for love to a pursuit of emotional and spiritual liberation. Through powerful language and imagery, Wroth challenges societal norms and critiques the limitations imposed on women during the Renaissance.
