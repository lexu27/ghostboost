The war between Mexico and the United States from 1846 to 1848 left a lasting imprint not only on the diplomatic ties between the two nations but also on the experiences of Mexican immigrants and Mexican Americans. This era marked a surge in the marginalization and bias faced by Mexicans, resulting in the portrayal of Mexican immigrants as indolent and delinquent individuals. These stereotypes deeply influenced perceptions of Mexican Americans, who encountered increased bigotry and often felt compelled to conceal their heritage.

Amidst the conflict, tensions soared between Mexico and the United States due to disputes such as the incorporation of Texas, a region Mexico considered its own. The subsequent triumph of the U.S. led to the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848, transferring a substantial portion of Mexican land to the United States. This annexation reinforced existing negative views of Mexicans, branding them as vanquished and inferior.

As Mexican immigrants streamed into the United States, they faced a hostile atmosphere that perpetuated these biases. They were depicted as idle and aimless, unwilling to toil and draining resources from American society. This portrayal was fueled by economic rivalries, as Mexicans often accepted lower wages for manual labor, provoking resentment among local laborers. The prevalent belief in Mexican predisposition to criminality worsened the discrimination against them.

These biases significantly shaped perceptions of Mexican Americans, who were frequently judged by association. Despite being U.S. citizens, their ethnicity made them susceptible to discrimination and bias. The depiction of Mexican immigrants as criminals reinforced the idea that Mexican Americans, too, were inclined towards unlawful behavior. This led to widespread injustices, including racial profiling and disproportionate punishments.

Moreover, the pressure on Mexican Americans to conceal their heritage stemmed directly from the discrimination they encountered. Many Mexican Americans felt compelled to assimilate into mainstream American society, forsaking their cultural and ethnic roots to evade prejudice. This erasure of identity perpetuated a cycle of bias, denying future generations a connection to their heritage and a sense of pride.

The annexation of Texas significantly influenced the dynamics between Mexico and the United States. As the U.S. expanded its territory at Mexico's expense, tensions heightened, contributing to the negative portrayal of Mexican immigrants and Mexican Americans. This annexation, coupled with the ensuing conflict, fostered an environment where Mexican immigrants and Mexican Americans were viewed as foreign and unwanted.

In summary, the war between Mexico and the United States from 1846 to 1848 had a lasting impact on Mexican immigrants and Mexican Americans. The characterization of Mexican immigrants as lethargic and criminal, exacerbated by the annexation of Texas, resulted in heightened discrimination and bias. The inclination of Mexican Americans to conceal their heritage was a response to this prejudice, further undermining their cultural pride. Understanding the historical context of this period is crucial in challenging and dismantling the systemic biases and discrimination that persist against Mexican Americans today.
