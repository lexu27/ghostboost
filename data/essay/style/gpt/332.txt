Cultural Norms and the Mirror Self-Recognition Test:

Shaping children's self-awareness, cultural norms play a pivotal role. The documentary "Human Consciousness" sheds light on the diverse self-recognition practices across societies. In Western cultures like the United States, individualistic values prevail, stressing independence and self-expression. These values nurture a unique self-perception, aiding success in the MSRT.

Conversely, in collectivist societies like Japan, group harmony takes precedence over individualism. Identity intertwines with communal values rather than personal distinction, making passing the MSRT challenging for children in such cultures. The focus on self-reflection and individual identity is limited, impacting their performance in the test.
