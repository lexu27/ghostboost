Morality, the perpetual debate on right and wrong, has intrigued philosophers for centuries. Objectivism claims universal moral truths exist, while relativism argues moral judgments are subjective. When considering if relativism offers a more pragmatic moral approach than objectivism, one must ponder the fluidity of human experiences and the array of moral values.

Relativism posits that ethical judgments vary across societies and individuals. It emphasizes cultural influences on ethics, illustrating how what is morally acceptable can differ between societies. For instance, euthanasia may be compassionate in one society but abhorrent in another. Relativism celebrates cultural diversity, acknowledging morals are not fixed but shaped by historical, social, and geographical factors.

Furthermore, moral relativism respects the diversity of human experiences, understanding individuals hold different values and perspectives. It upholds individuals' autonomy to make moral decisions based on personal beliefs. This perspective delves into the complexities of human psychology, recognizing upbringing, culture, and biases influence morality. Objectivism falls short in addressing the varied experiences and viewpoints shaping moral judgments.

Yet, absolutism has its value. Objectivism asserts universal moral truths beyond individual and cultural scopes, providing a clear moral compass. Without objective standards, societies would lack a foundation to condemn atrocities like genocide. Objectivism fosters moral consistency and stability, forming a coherent ethical structure.

In conclusion, objectivism presents a clear moral framework, while relativism grasps the nuances of human experiences and cultural values. Relativism's acknowledgment of cultural diversity and respect for individual autonomy renders it a pragmatic moral approach. Nonetheless, a balance between relativism and objectivism is vital, recognizing the strengths of each perspective. A synthesis of both can yield a deeper understanding of morality and enhance ethical reasoning.
