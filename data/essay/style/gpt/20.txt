One of the prominent risks linked to the project's ongoing progress is the insufficiency of financial resources. The development of a web-based system entails a significant investment in terms of both manpower and technology. To counter this risk, it is imperative to conduct a thorough cost analysis at the project's nascent stages. This analysis should encompass the assessment of expenses related to infrastructure, web development, data migration, and continuous maintenance. Exploring external funding opportunities or forging partnerships could also aid in easing financial constraints.

Another risk pertains to the possibility of scope creep, wherein the project requirements extend beyond the original scope, resulting in delays and escalated expenses. This can be addressed by ensuring the engagement of all stakeholders in delineating the project scope from the outset and by establishing a change control mechanism to oversee any alterations. Maintaining regular communication and collaboration amongst the development team, project managers, and university personnel can effectively thwart scope creep and ensure project cohesion.

Performance risks encompass challenges such as data security breaches and system reliability issues. Given the sensitive nature of student information and transcripts, stringent security measures are imperative. The development team should prioritize employing data encryption techniques, access control protocols, and routine security audits to mitigate the risks of unauthorized access or data breaches. System reliability can be upheld through continuous testing and monitoring, encompassing stress testing, load testing, and periodic data backups.

A structured approach should be adopted to identify and mitigate these risks. This involves conducting a comprehensive risk assessment during the project's initiation phase. Involving a diverse array of stakeholders, including IT specialists, university administrators, and end-users, in risk identification workshops or interviews can aid in uncovering potential threats and vulnerabilities. These risks should then be categorized based on their likelihood and impact, enabling the prioritization of mitigation measures.

To effectively mitigate the identified risks, it is crucial to devise and regularly review risk management plans. These plans should feature clear action steps, delineated responsibilities, and specific completion deadlines. Routine risk evaluations and progress updates will ensure that the mitigation strategies are on course and that emerging risks are promptly addressed.

In conclusion, the development of a web-based system for storing university information and transcripts carries risks associated with project continuity, completion, and system performance. Diligent identification and mitigation of these risks through meticulous cost analysis, controlled scope management, stringent security measures, and consistent risk assessment and management will bolster the project's success and result in the delivery of a high-caliber system.
