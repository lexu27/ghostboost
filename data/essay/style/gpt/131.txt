Lewin's change theory and Roger's five-step theory are commonly used in nursing practice to comprehend and execute change. These theories offer distinct perspectives on navigating the change process in healthcare environments.

Lewin's approach involves three key stages: unfreezing, moving, and refreezing. Unfreezing kickstarts change by establishing motivation through recognizing and communicating the need for it. Moving focuses on change implementation, while refreezing stabilizes and reinforces the new behavior or practice. This theory stresses the significance of a supportive environment and engaging all stakeholders in the change process.

In contrast, Roger's five-step theory, also named the Diffusion of Innovation theory, centers on the adoption of new ideas or practices within a social system. This theory outlines five stages: knowledge, persuasion, decision, implementation, and confirmation. It underscores the pivotal role of communication and persuasion in change promotion, along with the significance of opinion leaders and early adopters in facilitating the spread of new practices.

Both theories possess pros and cons. Lewin's theory offers a practical and straightforward approach, mapping out a clear route for change. It allows nurses to recognize the driving and restraining forces of change and promotes collaboration. However, it might oversimplify the change process by overlooking external factors or individual differences in readiness for change.

On the other hand, Roger's theory acknowledges the intricacy of change implementation in healthcare settings. It underscores the need to tailor communication strategies to different audiences and acknowledges the time required for new practices to gain widespread acceptance. Nevertheless, this theory may demand more time and resources compared to Lewin's theory.

In a nursing capstone project with limited time and resources, Lewin's theory may be more suitable. Its clear steps and emphasis on collaboration make it feasible to implement within a constrained timeframe. Additionally, Lewin's theory aligns with the patient-centered care approach, a crucial aspect of nursing practice.

In conclusion, both Lewin's change theory and Roger's five-step theory offer valuable insights into change implementation in healthcare. Depending on the context and available resources, one theory may be more appropriate than the other. For a nursing capstone project, Lewin's change theory emerges as the preferable choice.
