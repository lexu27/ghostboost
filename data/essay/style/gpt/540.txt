In the philosophical dialogue found in Plato's Gorgias, Socrates engages with Gorgias, Polus, and Callicles to delve into the essence and purpose of rhetoric and oratory skills. Through Socrates, Plato condemns the self-serving manipulation of rhetoric and underscores the significance of truth and justice in public discourse.

Socrates contends that rhetoric, when divorced from moral principles, is nothing more than empty praise and a perilous craft. He stresses the importance for orators to pursue truth and the greater good instead of exploiting emotions for selfish ends. This is evident in Socrates' probing of Gorgias, exposing Gorgias' focus on the power rhetoric bestows rather than its ethical considerations.

Likewise, the satirical film "Thank You for Smoking" satirizes the influence of rhetoric in contemporary society. Nick Naylor, the protagonist, utilizes his eloquent oratory skills as a mouthpiece for the tobacco industry, misleading the public with persuasive arguments in support of smoking, skewed data, and manipulative tactics. Naylor embodies the very opportunistic rhetoric Plato condemns, prioritizing personal gain over honesty and societal welfare.

Contrary to Naylor's deceptive approach, Plato's Socrates argues that genuine oratory should champion justice and authentic knowledge, valuing coherence and logic over superficial eloquence. This is exemplified in Socrates' exchange with Callicles, who champions the supremacy of those who wield rhetoric to fulfill their desires. Socrates challenges Callicles to defend his stance logically, dismantling his argument and demonstrating that rhetoric alone cannot establish a just society.

By illustrating the repercussions of manipulative rhetoric, "Thank You for Smoking" aligns with Plato's assertion that persuasive power must be wielded ethically. As Naylor undergoes a moral transformation throughout the film, he recognizes the harm caused by tobacco products and shifts his rhetoric towards advocating for consumer safety, abandoning deceit in favor of principled oratory.

In essence, Plato's Gorgias offers a penetrating analysis of rhetoric and oratory, underscoring the primacy of truth and justice in public speech. Echoing Plato's themes, "Thank You for Smoking" serves as a contemporary manifestation of the dangers of unscrupulous rhetoric and the potential for individuals to leverage their skills for virtuous ends. Both Plato and the film advocate for a conscientious and principled application of rhetoric, emphasizing the imperative of truth and justice above personal interests.
