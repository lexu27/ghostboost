In literature, the selection of words and stylistic elements plays a crucial role in molding the tone and significance of a written piece. This phenomenon is evident when examining three literary passages: William Shakespeare's contemplative soliloquy "To be or not to be" from Hamlet, F. Scott Fitzgerald's portrayal of Gatsby's extravagant gatherings in The Great Gatsby, and Maya Angelou's empowering poem "Still I Rise."

Shakespeare's poignant soliloquy delves into Hamlet's existential dilemma, showcasing his deep contemplation through carefully chosen words. Phrases like "To be or not to be," "whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer," and "the dread of something after death" evoke introspection and sorrow. Rhetorical questions such as "Who would fardels bear" heighten the soliloquy's desperation, intensifying its impact. Shakespeare's poetic language and metaphors, like "the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune," amplify the emotional burden of Hamlet's existential crisis, ultimately contributing to a tone of profound reflection and despair.

Moving to Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby, the author's descriptive language vividly illustrates Gatsby's opulent soir√©es. Words such as "riotous" and "lavish" depict a scene of luxury and excess. Fitzgerald utilizes similes, likening the parties to "an amusement park" and "a scene from the war," heightening the description's impact. The repetition of phrases like "champagne and the stars" and "drunk tanks and automobiles" underscores the extravagant nature of Gatsby's gatherings, reinforcing the overall tone of indulgence and decadence.

Lastly, Angelou's "Still I Rise" stands as a testament to resilience and defiance in the face of adversity. The poet's choice of empowering terms like "rise," "boom," and "sassiness" sets a tone of defiance. Stylistic devices such as repetition, notably the refrain "Still I rise," emphasize the poem's message of resilience and enhance its impact. Angelou's metaphors, likening herself to "air" and "moons," enable the reader to visualize her resilience and determination. The poem resonates with a tone of strength, resilience, and victory.

In summation, the selection of words and stylistic elements significantly shapes the tone and impact of literary passages. Shakespeare's soliloquy, Fitzgerald's vivid descriptions, and Angelou's empowering poem exemplify how meticulous word choice and stylistic elements contribute to the distinctive tone and impact of their respective works.
