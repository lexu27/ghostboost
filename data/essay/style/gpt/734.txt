Mary Midgley, the distinguished British philosopher, has significantly influenced the realm of moral philosophy. Within her essay "Trying Out One's New Sword," Midgley dissects moral isolationism, offering a distinctive viewpoint on the appraisal of diverse cultures. She contends that moral isolationism falls short in comprehending and appraising the moral customs of various societies.

Defined by Midgley, moral isolationism posits that outsiders cannot judge the moral practices of other cultures, viewing them as unfathomable. This notion implies the arbitrary and irreducible nature of moral values, devoid of a universal framework. Contrarily, Midgley rebuts this stance, asserting that such an approach hinders our grasp of diverse cultures and thwarts substantial ethical evaluations.

To underscore the fallacy of moral isolationism, Midgley sheds light on the 18th-century Japanese custom known as "trying out one's new sword." This practice permitted samurais to test their freshly crafted swords on unsuspecting peasants. While moral isolationism advocates for accepting this practice as a cultural norm without critique, Midgley dissents. She upholds the existence of universal moral values as a foundation for assessing such customs, citing human rights as an exemplar that transcends cultural relativism.

Additionally, Midgley amplifies her criticism of moral isolationism through the case of female genital mutilation (FGM) in certain African cultures. Despite its entrenched cultural roots, she refutes the moral isolationist argument that shields this practice from censure. Midgley asserts that FGM violates women's rights and bodily autonomy, warranting condemnation based on universal human rights principles.

Proposing an alternate approach to evaluating foreign cultures, Midgley introduces the concept of "moral progress." She advocates for scrutinizing and appraising cultural practices with the intent to enhance societal morality. Through this lens, harmful traditions can be challenged and positive transformations advocated for, rather than unquestioningly accepting cultural norms.

In summation, Mary Midgley's critique of moral isolationism convincingly dismantles the notion that the moral practices of different societies are inscrutable and beyond evaluation. Her illustrations from "Trying Out One's New Sword" effectively expose the fallacies of moral isolationism. Midgley's proposition of moral progress encourages a nuanced and critical perspective towards understanding and assessing foreign practices, aimed at fostering moral advancement. Her insights offer invaluable guidance for navigating the complexities of multicultural ethics in today's interconnected world.
