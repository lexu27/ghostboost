The project's significance lies in its ability to enhance patient care and outcomes in critical care units by exploring nurses' grasp of capnography and its practical application. Targeted interventions can bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and hands-on usage, empowering nurses to effectively monitor patients' respiratory status. This education can prompt timely interventions and potentially prevent respiratory complications.

To achieve this, a comprehensive training program will be implemented, covering theoretical concepts like waveform interpretation and practical aspects such as using capnography devices in simulated scenarios. Nurses will undergo assessments to gauge their proficiency in capnography usage, aiming to boost their practical skills in critical care settings.

Integrating capnography in critical care units could significantly elevate patient care by offering real-time ventilation data to identify respiratory issues promptly. Equipping nurses with the necessary knowledge and skills enables optimal utilization of capnography, leading to timely interventions in respiratory emergencies.

In summary, the project's focus on evaluating nurses' capnography knowledge and its practical application in critical care units plays a vital role in enhancing patient outcomes. Through a structured intervention protocol that educates and evaluates nurses, the project strives to seamlessly implement capnography in critical care settings, ensuring improved respiratory management and patient outcomes.
