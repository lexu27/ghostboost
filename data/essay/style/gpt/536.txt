The literary work "The Metamorphosis" penned by Franz Kafka delves deeply into the intricate workings of the human mind, serving as a catalyst for revealing the genuine sentiments and connections within Gregor Samsa's family. Gregor's sudden transformation into an insect brings to the forefront the strained bonds he shares with his family members, especially his father, who reacts with anger and disgust rather than compassion towards his new form. This violent response mirrors his pent-up frustrations and disapproval of Gregor's life choices, showcasing the true nature of their relationship. Similarly, Gregor's metamorphosis sheds light on his deteriorating relationship with his sister, Grete, as her initial care and affection gradually turn into indifference and rejection. This shift in her behavior highlights her self-centeredness and inability to handle adversity. Gregor's mother, once portrayed as nurturing and emotional, becomes distant and detached after his transformation, unable to face the reality of his new existence. This withdrawal signifies her fragility and emotional instability. The family as a whole distances themselves from Gregor, refusing to acknowledge him as their son and brother, opting for isolation and secrecy instead. Their denial of his transformation reflects their desire to evade the difficulties associated with caring for him, projecting their fears onto him and pushing him further into despair. Through these intricate relationships, Kafka prompts readers to ponder the complexities of familial bonds and how they are tested in times of adversity.
