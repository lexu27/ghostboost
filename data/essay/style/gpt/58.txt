Symbolism plays a crucial role in reinforcing the theme of everlasting love, with the kingdom by the sea symbolizing an eternal haven untouched by the passage of time and the sea itself representing the vastness and permanence of the speaker's devotion.

The moon emerges as a potent symbol of immortality, as the speaker's dreams of Annabel Lee under its light suggest a love that endures beyond the confines of life and death.
