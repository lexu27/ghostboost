Rousseau explores the concept of self-love in his writings, delving into two distinct manifestations: amour de soi-même and amour-propre. These two forms of self-love, though crucial in societal dynamics, differ significantly and impact inequalities across various spheres of life. In this piece, I aim to delve into Rousseau’s concept of self-love, its dual manifestations, and its relevance in analyzing the totalitarian society depicted in George Orwell’s 1984 novel.

Initially, Rousseau defines amour de soi-même as an inherent instinct for self-preservation and care that all humans possess. It represents a natural inclination towards self-preservation, physical well-being, and avoidance of pain. This innate form of self-love, according to Rousseau, stems from basic human instincts and is not inherently negative. For example, an individual seeking food when hungry acts out of amour de soi-même, a healthy self-love crucial for individual thriving and survival.

In contrast, Rousseau introduces another aspect of self-love, amour-propre, or self-esteem. Unlike amour de soi-même, amour-propre is a socially constructed form of self-love arising from external perceptions and judgments. It thrives on comparison, the pursuit of recognition, superiority, and validation. While amour de soi-même is innate, amour-propre is learned through societal interactions. Rousseau contends that amour-propre fuels many human vices and underpins societal inequalities.

The distinction between these two forms of self-love is stark. While amour de soi-même is a natural and vital aspect of human nature, amour-propre is a social construct shaped by societal influences. Amour de soi-même is a pure form of self-love focused on self-preservation and well-being, devoid of harm towards others. In contrast, amour-propre is ego-centric, reliant on external validation and competition for self-worth. This form of self-love breeds jealousy, vanity, and arrogance, fostering constant comparison and rivalry.

These two forms of self-love wield significant influence on social interactions. Amour de soi-même, rooted in self-preservation, fosters cooperation and mutual support, recognizing others’ value for personal well-being. It cultivates healthy relationships and collaboration in society. Conversely, amour-propre engenders a cycle of competition and comparison, driving individuals to seek validation and superiority, leading to a fractured society marked by envy, resentment, and a perpetual quest for recognition. Rousseau posits that amour-propre fuels social hierarchies as individuals strive for dominance over others to satisfy ego-driven desires.

The impact of these self-love manifestations on perpetuating inequalities is evident across various life domains. Rousseau underscores the role of amour-propre in politics, noting its contribution to unjust social contracts favoring the powerful. Those driven by amour-propre seek to maintain control and superiority, often at the expense of the less privileged, perpetuating social disparities and societal schisms.

In the context of Orwell’s 1984, amour-propre manifests in the Party’s totalitarian rule, aiming for absolute control over citizens through surveillance, manipulation, and mind control. Citizens endure constant scrutiny, comparison, and judgment by the Party, eroding their self-esteem and rendering them subservient. By manipulating citizens’ need for recognition and validation, the Party ensures their diminished self-worth precludes resistance or rebellion.

In conclusion, Rousseau’s exploration of self-love reveals two distinct manifestations: amour de soi-même and amour-propre. While both forms shape societal dynamics, they differ significantly, impacting inequalities in diverse realms. Amour de soi-même, a natural and healthy self-love rooted in self-preservation, contrasts with amour-propre, a socially constructed self-esteem driven by external validation and comparison. The latter fosters societal fragmentation, competition, and hierarchical perpetuation. Applying these insights to Orwell’s 1984 underscores how amour-propre fuels the Party’s totalitarian control by manipulating citizens’ self-esteem. Rousseau’s reflections on self-love offer valuable perspectives on societal dynamics and inequality perpetuation.
