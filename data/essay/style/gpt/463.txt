The major causes of intraoperative hypotension span anesthesia-related factors, patient-related factors, and surgical factors. Anesthesia-related factors encompass the use of anesthetic medications, particularly volatile anesthetic agents and sedatives, inducing vasodilation and lowering systemic vascular resistance (SVR). Moreover, the induction and maintenance of general anesthesia can suppress the sympathetic nervous system, resulting in reduced cardiac output and blood pressure. Patient-related factors involve pre-existing conditions like hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes, compromising the body's compensatory mechanisms and increasing vulnerability to intraoperative hypotension. Dehydration, hypothermia, and inadequate preload due to fasting or blood loss are additional patient-related factors. Surgical factors, such as tourniquet use, cross-clamping of great vessels, and surgical positioning, can also contribute to intraoperative hypotension by decreasing venous return, cardiac output, and causing tissue ischemia, thereby affecting blood pressure regulation at the cellular/receptor level. These causes of intraoperative hypotension modulate blood pressure by interfering with the normal physiological mechanisms involved in blood pressure regulation. Vasodilatory medications, like volatile anesthetic agents, act on smooth muscle cells to induce relaxation, mediated by membrane-bound receptors such as G protein-coupled receptors, leading to the release of intracellular mediators like cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). This series of events triggers the activation of potassium channels, potassium efflux, and subsequent hyperpolarization of the cell membrane, resulting in reduced calcium influx through L-type calcium channels, causing vasodilation and blood pressure reduction.
