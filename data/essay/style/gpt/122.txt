Euthanasia, the deliberate act of ending a person's life to alleviate their suffering, is a subject of intense controversy with profound ethical implications. Various ethical theories - teleology, deontology, and Emmanuel Lévinas' "face of the other" theory - offer differing viewpoints on euthanasia, all deeming it deeply unethical and contrary to moral principles. Exploring these perspectives provides a comprehensive understanding of the ethical complexities surrounding euthanasia.

From a teleological standpoint, which focuses on the outcomes of actions to determine their ethical value, euthanasia is considered unethical due to its potential societal implications. Concerns revolve around the power individuals may wield in making life-altering decisions, posing risks of coercion and abuse, particularly for vulnerable groups such as the disabled, elderly, or mentally ill. Additionally, embracing euthanasia may erode the sanctity of life, treating life as disposable and its preservation contingent on quality of life, contrary to the fundamental moral duty of preserving human life.

Contrastingly, deontology, centered on adhering to moral duties regardless of consequences, also condemns euthanasia as unethical. Deontologists argue that certain actions are inherently right or wrong, irrespective of outcomes, stressing the duty of healthcare professionals to uphold life and alleviate suffering rather than actively ending it. They uphold moral laws and duties that must never be transgressed, emphasizing that intentionally causing someone's death contradicts fundamental ethical principles.

Emmanuel Lévinas offers a distinct perspective through his "face of the other" theory, asserting that ethical obligations stem from encountering the individuality, vulnerability, and uniqueness of others. According to Lévinas, euthanasia is deeply unethical as it objectifies individuals, reducing them to objects of control and manipulation, disregarding their inherent dignity and autonomy. He underscores the ethical responsibility to care for and respect others, especially the most vulnerable and dependent.

Though these ethical theories approach euthanasia from diverse angles, they converge in their belief that euthanasia is fundamentally unethical and violates moral laws. Teleology emphasizes the potential societal consequences of legalizing euthanasia, deontology stresses the moral duty to preserve life, and Lévinas' theory accentuates the dignity and care owed to others. The discussion on euthanasia must consider these ethical implications, recognizing the importance of preserving life, upholding human dignity, and navigating complex relationships.

In summary, teleology, deontology, and Emmanuel Lévinas' perspectives align in considering euthanasia unethical and contrary to moral principles. These ethical stances underscore the significance of preserving life, respecting human dignity, and fulfilling our duty to care for others. While debates on euthanasia persist, understanding these ethical implications is vital in making informed decisions regarding end-of-life care and human life's sanctity.
