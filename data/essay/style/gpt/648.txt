The representation of women in cinema has frequently faced criticism for upholding traditional gender norms and perpetuating power dynamics between the sexes. Two notable films that exemplify this phenomenon are "The Postman Always Rings Twice" and "The Dark Knight Rises". By analyzing them through the lenses of the male gaze theory and psychoanalysis, it becomes apparent how familial constraints in melodramas contribute to these power dynamics.

According to Laura Mulvey's male gaze theory, prevalent in films directed largely by men, women are often objectified as objects of desire for male viewers. This is evident in "The Postman Always Rings Twice" through the portrayal of Cora, the female protagonist, who is consistently depicted in a manner that accentuates her sexual appeal. The camera focuses on her physical attributes, emphasizing her as an object of desire and reinforcing the dominance-submission dynamic, where her sexuality is exploited for control.

Psychoanalysis, as proposed by Sigmund Freud, posits that women are confined by societal expectations, particularly within familial structures. In "The Dark Knight Rises", Miranda Tate initially appears as a formidable businesswoman but is ultimately revealed to be a mere pawn in the male antagonist's scheme. Her role in the narrative ultimately reduces her to a subordinate figure, reinforcing male authority.

Furthermore, the melodrama genre, known for its exploration of family dynamics and emotional vulnerability, further solidifies these constraints. In "The Postman Always Rings Twice", Cora's marriage to an older, impotent man limits her agency and enforces submissiveness. Similarly, in "The Dark Knight Rises", Miranda's relationship with her father contributes to her eventual acquiescence to male power.

By dissecting the depiction of women in film through the male gaze theory and psychoanalysis, it is evident how familial restrictions in melodramas bolster dominance-submission dynamics between men and women. The specific instances from "The Postman Always Rings Twice" and "The Dark Knight Rises" underscore the objectification and subordination of women, perpetuating the unequal power dynamics entrenched in mainstream cinema. It is imperative for filmmakers to challenge these stereotypes and aim for more intricate and empowering representations of women on screen.
