The 17th century witnessed a notable era in history when Neo-Confucian philosophies wielded considerable influence over the governments of China, Japan, and the Ottoman Empire. Despite their geographical and cultural diversity, these societies held shared beliefs and customs concerning the status of women. By delving into the regulations, limitations, and societal norms prevalent in these Neo-Confucian administrations, we can draw comparisons and contrasts regarding the female experiences across these regions.

In China, the Neo-Confucian rule placed women in a subservient role within society. The Family Law of 1636 bolstered the patriarchal hierarchy, stressing women's obedience to men and the superiority of male lineage. The government regulated marriage and enacted legal statutes that curtailed women's rights and liberties. Notably, the practice of foot-binding, originating in the 10th century, gained popularity during this period. While not legally mandated, it evolved into a symbol of beauty, status, and compliance. This custom reinforced the image of women as submissive and physically reliant on men, effectively constraining their movements.

Similarly, in 17th-century Japan, women faced societal expectations and constraints that perpetuated subordinate roles. The Tokugawa Shogunate enforced policies aimed at societal control, including stringent regulations on marriage and inheritance. Women were viewed as upholders of the family's honor and were obligated to adhere to strict codes of conduct known as the "good wife, wise mother" ideology. They were expected to be obedient, modest, and proficient in household tasks. Rooted in Neo-Confucian principles, this ideology confined women to domestic spheres, restricting their access to education and public life.

In contrast to the experiences of women in China and Japan, the status of women in the Ottoman Empire during the 17th century revealed intriguing distinctions. Ottoman society was structured around the Islamic faith, offering women more opportunities compared to their counterparts in China and Japan. Islamic teachings acknowledged the significance of women in society, stressing their rights and roles within the community. Despite certain restrictions and expectations of modesty and virtue, female education was encouraged. Women from elite backgrounds actively participated in arts and scholarship. While hierarchical structures existed, exemplified by practices like polygamy, Islamic teachings granted women a sense of agency somewhat lacking in Chinese and Japanese societies.

Beyond legal constraints, understanding the impact of societal expectations on women's lives during the 17th century is crucial. In all three regions, prevailing societal norms imposed ideals of femininity dictating behavior, appearance, and social roles. Confucian doctrines influenced the perception of women as intellectually inferior, emphasizing their domestic duties. These gender norms were perpetuated through education and cultural practices. For instance, women in China and Japan were expected to engage in calligraphy, poetry, and other arts deemed suitable for their refined feminine nature. Similarly, the Ottoman Empire emphasized the institution of the harem, segregating women from men and highlighting their role as guardians of moral virtue and the family's honor.

In conclusion, the status of women in Neo-Confucian regimes during the 17th century exhibited remarkable similarities in China and Japan, with both societies imposing strict laws, restrictions, and societal expectations that subordinated women. These constraints limited their mobility, hindered their educational opportunities, and confined them to domestic roles. While the Ottoman Empire, influenced by Islamic teachings with a relatively more inclusive view of women, enforced restrictions maintaining a hierarchical structure. The experiences of women across these regions underscore the profound impact of Neo-Confucian ideologies on gender roles, emphasizing the necessity for a critical reassessment of societal expectations to advance gender equality.
