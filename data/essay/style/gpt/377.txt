In Olga Tokarczuk's enthralling book, "Drive Your Plow over the Bones of the Dead," the main character's utilization of nicknames offers a distinct viewpoint through which her beliefs and outlook on humans and animals are unveiled. Janina, the mysterious and quirky lead, employs nicknames as a means to subvert and contest societal standards, providing a unique juxtaposition between formal names and informal labels that profoundly communicates her worldview.

Janina assigns unconventional nicknames to the individuals she meets in her quaint Polish town, such as Oddball, Bigfoot, and Dizzy. These atypical titles mirror her defiance against the predetermined identities imposed on people. By assigning such monikers, Janina rises above the shallowness of conventional names and delves into the core of each individual. This indicates a profound grasp and admiration for uniqueness, stressing that genuine essence transcends societal classifications.

Additionally, Janina's use of nicknames enables her to blur the line between humans and animals. She allocates animal-related nicknames to those she shares a strong connection with, viewing animals on par with or even superior to humans. For example, she nicknames the neighbor she deeply respects as "Moose." Through associating animal monikers with specific individuals, Janina breaches the hierarchical barrier, emphasizing the shared vulnerability and intrinsic worth of all living beings. Her viewpoint contests the prevailing belief in human superiority over animals, instead advocating for unity and mutual existence.

Moreover, Janina's inclination towards nicknames can be interpreted as her defiance against societal artifice. She challenges the idea that names carry inherent authority and significance. Janina acknowledges that names often hold superficial meaning without genuine essence. By embracing nicknames, she symbolically sheds the outward pretense maintained by society, reminding others of the inherent hollowness within it.

In "Drive Your Plow over the Bones of the Dead," Janina's adoption of nicknames establishes a stark comparison between formal names and informal labels, offering insights into her principles and viewpoints on humans and animals. Through this unorthodox naming practice, she directs attention to the depth of individuality, disputes human superiority, and queries the importance of societal frameworks. Janina's distinct approach urges readers not only to scrutinize the significance we attribute to names but also to reassess our treatment of both humans and animals, ultimately advocating for a kinder and more inclusive world.
