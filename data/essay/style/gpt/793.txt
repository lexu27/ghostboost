George F. Becker, a key geologist in the late 19th century, played a vital role in shaping the American perspective on imperial expansion through his time in South Africa and the Philippines. Celebrated as an educator among the American political elite, Becker also played a part in enlightening people about unfamiliar regions and their resources. Nevertheless, his contentious choices and activities, which encompassed military involvement and the manipulation of reports, demand thorough scrutiny.

Becker's encounters in South Africa and the Philippines unveiled to him the immense natural riches and economic prospects of these lands. As an educator within the American political circle, he grasped the significance of disseminating this awareness to the general public, enriching the American perception of imperial expansion. In his various forms of communication, such as reports, lectures, and writings, Becker underscored the mineral wealth and strategic importance of South Africa and the Philippines, accentuating the potential for economic prosperity and influence within these territories.

Furthermore, Becker's function as an educator amid the American political elite aided in enlightening policymakers about unfamiliar regions and their resources. Through his engagements with influential personalities like government officials and business leaders, he shared his firsthand knowledge and cultivated a deeper comprehension of the advantages of imperial expansion. In doing so, Becker contributed to steering the national dialogue towards an acceptance of expansionism and the assimilation of new territories into American authority, both of which were fundamental to the American imperial agenda.

Nonetheless, it is imperative to subject Becker's decisions and deeds to critical analysis. Perhaps the most contentious aspect of his involvement in imperial expansion was his active participation in military operations. As a civilian geologist, Becker's role in military affairs was questionable, blurring the lines between scientific exploration and military endeavors. This deliberate blurring raises doubts about the objectivity and fairness of his reports, suggesting they might have been swayed by the desired outcomes of military campaigns rather than offering a truthful portrayal of the regions' resources.

Moreover, Becker's intentional manipulation of reports must also be examined as it undermines the honesty and openness of his work. In a bid to justify and legitimize American engagement in foreign lands, he selectively presented information that aligned with the imperialistic motives of the American political elite. By omitting or downplaying certain aspects, such as the repercussions of imperial expansion on local populations and environments, Becker's reports perpetuated a one-sided narrative that skewed public perception and obstructed a comprehensive understanding of the territories being discussed.

In addition to his controversial involvements in South Africa, Becker's actions in the Philippines raise additional ethical concerns. During the Philippine-American War, he collaborated with American military figures, offering scientific insights and suggestions for military operations. This collaboration blurs the boundary between scientific pursuit and political objectives, prompting questions about Becker's role as an educator within the American political elite. While his contributions may have heightened awareness of the Philippines' resources and economic potential, they must also be viewed within the context of a war of conquest and occupation.

To conclude, George F. Becker played a significant role in shaping the American vision of imperial expansion. As an educator within the American political elite, he aided in raising awareness of unfamiliar regions and their resources. Through his experiences in South Africa and the Philippines, Becker shed light on the economic prospects of these territories and nurtured a conversation about imperial expansion. Nonetheless, Becker's controversial choices and actions, particularly his involvement in military operations and manipulation of reports, must be critically evaluated. These actions cast doubt on the objectivity and integrity of his work and raise ethical concerns about his role as an educator within the American political elite.
