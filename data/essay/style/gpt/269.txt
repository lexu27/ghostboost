Loneliness pervades Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, a theme that echoes through the Monster's character development. Shelley delves into the repercussions of societal seclusion on the creature's growth, showcasing how isolation shapes his choices and yearnings.

From the onset, the Monster's solitary existence defines him profoundly. The absence of companionship molds his identity, especially after Victor Frankenstein's abandonment thrusts him into a solitary odyssey. This alienation fosters a profound sense of isolation within him, sparking a relentless pursuit for camaraderie that steers his subsequent endeavors.

The Monster's yearning for connection resonates in his interactions with others. His fascination with the De Lacey family stems from their affectionate bond, a stark contrast to his own isolation. As he longs to be part of their unit, his grotesque appearance provokes revulsion and rejection, deepening his solitude and reinforcing his sense of loneliness.

As the Monster's isolation deepens, so does his animosity towards humanity. His resentment towards Victor and mankind burgeons, attributing them as the architects of his torment. Driven by his isolation, he exacts vengeance on Victor and society, forsaking morality in pursuit of companionship and retribution, morphing into a creature of darkness.

Shelley implies that the Monster's isolation impedes his moral and emotional growth. Bereft of guidance and companionship, he navigates a world devoid of ethical bearings. Had he been embraced with companionship and acceptance, his trajectory might have veered towards empathy and compassion.

In summation, loneliness permeates Frankenstein, underscoring the Monster's evolution. Shelley illuminates the repercussions of societal ostracism and the absence of companionship. The Monster's quest for connection steers his fate towards destruction. Through the prism of loneliness, Shelley probes the essence of human need for companionship and the ramifications of its denial.
