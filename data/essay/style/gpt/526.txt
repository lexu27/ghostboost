Introduction:
Exploring the realm of epigenetics, a genetic subset, involves delving into the effects of external stimuli and personal choices on genetic behavior. By scrutinizing epigenetics, one can grasp how an individual's likelihood of developing particular health issues, such as type 2 diabetes, can be molded by environmental elements and behavioral decisions. This paper seeks to delve into the significance of epigenetics in comprehending type 2 diabetes and its risk factors while investigating how environmental and behavioral influences shape genetic behavior. Furthermore, it will delve into the potential for both elevating and reducing disease susceptibility through epigenetic alterations and illuminate the impact of social determinants of health and the importance of familial background in evaluating disease vulnerability.
