The impact of Roman rule over Greek-speaking areas and the incorporation of Roman names into public life were complex and diverse, evolving across different periods and regions. The interplay between these two civilizations was shaped by geographical, political, and social factors, resulting in distinct outcomes across various territories.

At the outset of Roman conquests in Greek-speaking territories, there was an effort to merge Greek culture with Roman practices through a process known as Hellenization. This led to a blending of Roman and Greek customs, including the adoption of Greek names or variations thereof by Roman citizens to assimilate into the local milieu and enhance cross-cultural communication.

As Roman authority expanded, a shift towards Romanization emerged, especially in places like Egypt and Asia Minor. Roman names gained prominence, reflecting the supremacy of Roman culture and the elite's aspiration to uphold their status and distinctiveness. Notably, Roman officials and military figures often bore both Roman and Greek names, underscoring their dual loyalties and projecting authority and influence.

The propagation of Roman names and the establishment of a shared onomastic tradition were facilitated by various means. The extensive Roman Empire road network and efficient governance structures facilitated the dissemination of Roman names across diverse territories. Moreover, the significance of Roman citizenship and the bestowal of Roman names upon non-Romans as a mark of distinction further propagated Roman naming conventions.

Local elites played a pivotal role in mediating these cultural exchanges, acting as bridges between Roman rulers and the indigenous populace. They frequently adopted Roman names and practices to curry favor and maintain their social standing, embodying Roman virtues and aiding in the adoption of Roman naming customs among the local inhabitants.

Names were not merely identifiers but potent symbols of authority and prestige. It was customary for Roman elites to possess multiple names, including a praenomen (first name), nomen (clan name), and cognomen (family name), signifying social status and familial connections to esteemed lineages and ancestors.

The advent of Christianity in the later stages of antiquity, coupled with the decline of the Roman Empire, heralded a transformation in naming conventions. Christian names, often derived from biblical characters, gained prevalence, while names linked to Roman gods and pagan traditions waned in popularity as the new faith distanced itself from classical influences.

In summary, the ramifications of Roman dominance over Greek-speaking territories and the propagation of Roman names were manifold, shaped by a myriad of influences. The interplay between the two cultures was nuanced, with Hellenization and Romanization serving as pivotal mechanisms. Elite civic figures played a crucial role in facilitating these cultural exchanges, with names serving as expressions of identity, authority, and distinction. The evolution in naming practices during late antiquity, influenced by the rise of Christianity and the waning of Roman power, marked a significant departure from earlier Roman naming conventions.
