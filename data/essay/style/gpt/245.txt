Public corruption presents a multifaceted and intricate challenge that impacts individuals, organizations, and entire societies. It undermines public trust, subverts the rule of law, and impedes economic progress. The causes of public corruption can be classified into individual, organizational, and societal realms. This discourse will delve into these causes, drawing from academic studies and real-world instances, while scrutinizing the role of ethics in the criminal justice system in combating and forestalling public corruption.

At the individual level, motivations for public corruption often stem from personal avarice and the pursuit of self-interest. Some individuals yield to the allure of kickbacks, fraud, or favoritism for personal or financial gains. An illustration is seen in the scandal involving former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak, who allegedly siphoned billions from the state-owned investment fund, 1MDB, driven by personal greed and ambition.

Moreover, inadequate remuneration can push individuals towards corrupt practices. In certain countries, public servants receive meager salaries, making them susceptible to bribery and coercion. For instance, poorly paid law enforcement officers may be enticed by illicit payments, fostering a breeding ground for corruption as they seek to supplement their income.

Furthermore, ethical considerations and personal values can influence individuals' propensity towards corruption. Some defend their corrupt deeds by rationalizing them as necessary for their families' well-being or social status maintenance. When personal interests eclipse ethical principles, individuals are prone to deviating from their ethical responsibilities, as evidenced by the Watergate scandal involving President Richard Nixon.

Transitioning to the organizational sphere, public corruption can be attributed to systemic shortcomings within governmental bodies. Inadequate frameworks, opacity, and lack of accountability breed an environment conducive to corruption. Weak control of corruption often correlates with deficient governance structures, inefficient public administration, and prevalent bribery, as indicated by a report from the World Bank.

The case of "Insys Therapeutics" in the United States illustrates how organizational factors can fuel public corruption. The pharmaceutical company engaged in corrupt practices to boost opioid sales, incentivizing doctors through illicit means, resulting in widespread addiction and fatalities. The organizational ethos at Insys Therapeutics prioritized profit over ethics and public welfare, fostering a culture of corruption.

On a societal scale, corrupt practices can be perpetuated by cultural norms that tolerate or even glorify corruption. In some societies, corruption is deeply ingrained, normalized as a societal norm. This normalization heightens the likelihood of individuals engaging in corrupt acts. The Petrobras scandal in Brazil exemplifies the societal repercussions of corruption, where millions were funneled through kickbacks and bribes to secure business deals, reflecting the entrenched culture of corruption that impedes social and economic progress.

Ethics serve as a linchpin in combatting and preventing public corruption within the criminal justice system. Upholding ethical standards can cultivate a culture of integrity and act as a deterrent against corrupt behaviors.
