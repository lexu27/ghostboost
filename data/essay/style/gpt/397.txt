The era known as Victorian, spanning from 1837 to 1901, embodied a strict commitment to moral principles, traditional societal standards, and a rich literary heritage. In contrast, contemporary America, defined by individualism and the erosion of conventional values, has experienced a shift in societal norms and an uptick in criminal activities. These disparities have significantly impacted the realm of literature. This discussion will analyze and draw parallels between these two historical periods concerning moral principles, societal norms, and their implications on literature and crime rates.

The Victorian epoch was characterized by a firm emphasis on moral values and a strict adherence to codes of behavior. Religion wielded a profound influence on society, particularly Christianity, which played a central role in shaping moral standards. Virtues like self-discipline, modesty, and self-restraint held great importance. These moral principles extended into personal relationships, with marriage being deemed essential for societal harmony. The belief in a structured society and hierarchical order lay at the heart of Victorian conventions.

Conversely, modern America has witnessed a gradual decline in these traditional moral values. With the rise of individualism and the prominence of personal liberties, societal norms have become more lenient and subjective. There is a growing acceptance of diverse lifestyles and relationships that would have been frowned upon during the Victorian era. Concepts like same-sex marriage and non-traditional family structures have gained wider approval.

The societal norms prevalent during the Victorian era exerted a considerable influence on literature. Renowned authors such as Charles Dickens and Jane Austen frequently depicted the moral quandaries individuals faced in their pursuit of happiness. Their works were replete with characters grappling with societal pressures and the challenges posed by societal expectations. These literary creations captured the essence of Victorian life and reflected the repercussions of deviating from accepted norms.

Likewise, contemporary American literature mirrors the evolving societal norms of the era. Writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Toni Morrison delve into themes such as individualism, racism, and the impact of consumerism on moral values. Their works delve into the intricacies of personal freedom and the consequences of diverging from traditional expectations. Modern American literature not only mirrors the shifting moral landscape but also serves as a critique of it.

While the Victorian era was distinguished by its emphasis on moral values, it was not devoid of crime. However, the perception of crime and its repercussions differed from that of modern America. The criminal justice system in the Victorian era was severe and often focused on punishment rather than rehabilitation. Public executions served as a deterrent to crime, with offenders facing severe penalties for even minor transgressions.

In contrast, contemporary America grapples with a rising crime rate that must be contextualized within complex societal issues. The decline of traditional moral values and the disintegration of communities have led to increased criminal activities. Factors such as poverty, inequality, and substance abuse contribute to criminal behavior. The criminal justice system has evolved to encompass both punitive measures and rehabilitative efforts, aiming to tackle the underlying causes of criminality.

The portrayal of crime in literature varies between the two periods. In the Victorian era, crime and its consequences were often explored in novels and poems. Authors like Arthur Conan Doyle and Wilkie Collins incorporated mysteries and criminal investigations as central themes in their works. These narratives were not only entertaining but also reflected the societal fears and anxieties surrounding crime during that era.

In contemporary American literature, crime is frequently depicted as a symptom of broader societal issues. Writers like James Ellroy and Truman Capote delve into the psychological aspects of criminality, exploring the motivations and complexities of offenders. These works serve as a reflection of the deeper societal issues that underlie criminal behavior.

In conclusion, the Victorian era and modern America diverge significantly in terms of moral values, societal norms, and their impact on literature and crime rates. The Victorian era was characterized by a stringent adherence to moral values and societal hierarchy, while modern America is defined by individualism and the erosion of traditional norms. Literature from both eras reflects and comments on these shifts, portraying the moral dilemmas faced by individuals caught between societal expectations and personal freedoms. The treatment of crime rates has also evolved, with the Victorian era emphasizing punishment and the modern American system focusing on rehabilitation.
