Construct Development and Scale Creation
Operating Definition
Operational definition of depression: a mood disorder characterized by depressed mood and anhedonia for more than two weeks, which is often accompanied by a decrease in the ability to perform daily tasks and a feeling of helplessness, including reoccurring suicidal thoughts. Guillot-Valdés et al. (2019) note that depressive disorders are clinically diagnosed when a patient has depressive symptoms for more than two weeks, one of which is low mood and anhedonia. Nguyen et al. (2018) identify depression “as persistent sadness, a loss of interest and energy, an inability to carry out daily activities, a change in appetite or sleeping time, poor concentration, hopelessness and thoughts of self-harm or suicide” (p. 2). Garcı´a-Batista et al. (2018) underline that depression is also associated with “decreased concentration and decision-making ability, loss of self-confidence, feelings of inferiority or worthlessness and guilt” (p. 2). Additionally, depressive disorder is related to manifestations of fear and anger, as well as symptoms of anxiety (Guillot-Valdés et al., 2019). Comorbidity between depression and anxiety disorders is a significant challenge in developing definitions and symptom measurement instruments.
Items used to Sample the Domain
 1. Manifestations of depressed mood including feelings of sadness, worthlessness, hopelessness;
 2. Loss of interest, including a decreased ability to experience pleasure and joy;
 3. Reoccuring suicide thoughts;
 4. Disorders in daily activities including decreased concentration and decision-making ability;
 5. Manifestations of symptoms of anxiety including fear, anger, and irritability.
Method of Scaling
The method of scaling appropriate for the described domain is an indication of the extent of the patient’s symptoms, including never, sometimes, often, very often, constantly. These items, in turn, are associated with numeric scaling from 0 to 4, where 0 is never, 1 is sometimes, 2 is often, 3 is very often, 4 is constantly. This scaling method was chosen because it makes it easier for the patient to interact with the test. By noting the frequency of occurrence of symptoms, they will be able to assess their emotional manifestations more deeply. For the therapist, this scaling allows to assess the general picture of the patient’s psychological state and obtain a result that is suitable for measurement. Additionally, this scaling helps to determine not only the presence or absence of symptoms of depression but also to assess their severity preliminarily.

Interview or Self-Report
This instrument is more appropriate for patient self-reporting, as it implies a more superficial identification of the manifestation of symptoms. Stuart et al. (2014) report that “61% of the study population identified as having a history of depression using the SCID / NP also self-reporting past depression” (p. 868). Thus, this instrument can be used to determine the presence of symptoms and indications for a more detailed interview with the therapist. It provides not sufficient amount of specific information to be used in interviews.
Analysis and Justification
Norm and Reliability Scores
The definition of norm scores for a scaling instrument allows you to determine the influence of background factors on the test results. Such aspects include gender, age, educational level, and others respondents’ characteristics. Roelofs et al. (2013) argue that a multiple regression analysis allows fairly reliable determining the predicates of the norm, as well as establishing possible interactions between them. Thus, the use of this approach provides the norm score for a more accurate interpretation of the results.
Reliability is a measure of how well test results reflect reality. Nolte et al. (2019) note that this criterion consists of “internal consistency and test-retest reliability” (p. 2). There are
