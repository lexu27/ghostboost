Health care safety and well-being are crucial factors in achieving a healthy population. The advancement of patient technology has brought about significant changes in nursing practices. Previously, nurses relied on their senses to monitor patients, but with the introduction of technology, new measures have been implemented to enhance health care services. Although technological advancements like Automated IV Pumps have improved efficiency and reduced errors in patient care, there is still a pressing need to address existing challenges. Despite the benefits, issues related to patient safety persist, requiring further research and attention. While technology has enhanced patient care, concerns about patient safety remain, necessitating a careful balance between technological advancements and patient well-being.
