In the text, the predominant emotion is neutral. Here is the text rewritten with a positive emotional tone:

Both Christianity and postmodern relativism celebrate spirituality and its impact on human life. Christianity upholds the belief in a sovereign God who orchestrates all aspects of the universe, shaping life events. This theological lens shapes how individuals perceive God as omnipotent and eternal (Lasair, 2020). Christians ground their belief systems in the portrayal of God in the Holy Bible, elucidating the purpose, truth, and significance of human life, which in turn influences their approach to healthcare. By relying on a higher power, Christians can attain a transcendent state in healthcare experiences and other life events.

By following God's guidance in every decision, Christians find solace in life's outcomes. They exhibit greater acceptance of healthcare results compared to non-believers due to their conviction that every fate, whether positive or negative, is divinely permitted. Biblical principles steer their ethical compass, especially in healthcare matters (Lasair, 2020). For example, Christians view abortion as akin to murdering an unborn child and thus do not condone it. Consequently, healthcare choices within Christianity are deeply rooted in biblical teachings.

In contrast to Christianity's adherence to clear guidelines, postmodern relativism embraces a liberal stance on spirituality and ethics. Relativists believe in the validity of diverse spiritual and ethical beliefs, even if they contradict each other. This approach discourages discarding any healthcare argument or decision. Postmodern relativism advocates for diversity and multicultural approaches to healthcare, emphasizing the need for medical professionals to embrace and respect varied and sometimes conflicting patient and family perspectives (Garrett, 2018). Furthermore, ethical understandings may vary from one patient to another without compromising the quality of care.

Scientism contends that hard sciences offer superior scientific knowledge, representing the sole repository of genuine and absolute truths. Disciplines like physics and biology rely on natural laws and experimentation to yield reliable, testable, factual, and replicable data. Soft sciences are deemed inferior or pseudo-sciences as their conjectures and hypotheses are perceived as unverifiable or subject to change (Vukov, 2021). Scientism aims to delineate these two science categories based on the value of their information, with hard sciences positing more valuable insights than soft sciences. The reliance on subjectivity renders soft sciences susceptible to human influences, fostering conflicting ideas on similar principles. Overall, scientism accords greater intellectual authority to hard sciences over soft sciences in matters of knowledge.

Counterarguments challenge scientism and its elevation of hard sciences. The first argument refutes the assertion that hard sciences rely on immutable data by highlighting the impact of evolving measuring instruments and environmental fluctuations (Vukov, 2021). Consequently, scientific knowledge is not absolute, evolving with new information, blurring the distinction between hard and soft sciences. The second argument critiques the authoritarian stance of hard sciences that eschew personal opinions in favor of rationality. Acknowledging the significance of deliberate thoughts in knowledge discovery, this critique posits that the dogmatic approach of scientism impedes scientific progress. Thus, soft sciences are positioned to advance scientific knowledge through the exploration of new information, as they value intentional thought processes.
