Using private means of transport instead of public transport can be a more convenient way to commute. The complications in public transportation arise from city planning and development, leading to a lack of understanding of how the system functions. The disconnect between public transportation and destinations can be attributed to the design of the road network. Public transportation was primarily designed for commuting to and from cities, neglecting interstate travel. Studies indicate that many Americans commute between suburban routes not serviced by public transport, resulting in the dominance of car culture. This design flaw also makes it challenging to travel between suburbs on foot once reaching the desired destination.

The issue with public transportation lies in its lack of privacy and focus on density, leading to uncomfortable interactions and increased stress levels. Improving the reliability and connectivity of neighborhoods through public transport is crucial. Government investment in enhancing public transportation operations could lead to a significant redesign of the transportation mode.

A key challenge with public transportation is the lack of privacy and increased stress levels compared to private vehicles. Restructuring the system to facilitate inter-suburb transportation and reduce walking distances between stops could greatly enhance convenience. Shifting the perspective on public transportation to a public service rather than a capitalist perspective could lead to better outcomes for citizens. By minimizing the walking distance between stops and workplaces, the convenience of public transportation could potentially surpass that of private vehicles, changing transportation priorities.
