Social media platforms have intricate algorithms that suggest information or advertising based on users' interests. For example, TikTok's algorithms are clearly seen when watching an engaging video. The app organizes topics and suggests similar videos to keep the user engaged. To test this, I watched numerous ice-skating videos. As a result, every third video on TikTok was related to ice-skating. When I scrolled past ice-skating videos without watching, they appeared less frequently in my feed. The same algorithm applies when I skip interesting videos and watch something different. It becomes challenging to find videos I like as the algorithm tracks all my actions.
Instagram and YouTube operate on similar algorithms, with ads typically influenced by past Google searches. Recently, while searching for new shoes, I noticed a surge in shoe advertisements while watching YouTube videos or browsing Instagram stories. Additionally, some algorithms can pick up on audio, capturing product names during conversations, leading to promotions in social media feeds. While this technology can be useful for tailored information and sometimes offers relevant products, the idea of devices potentially listening and sharing conversations with AI may unsettle some, impacting trust levels.
