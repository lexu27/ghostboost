Toyota Motor Manufacturing UK should focus on the United Arab Emirates as its next market. Following a macro-environment evaluation, the country has a stable environment, which is conducive to the company. The country has a stable government, a growing economy, and a well-developed infrastructure. Furthermore, because of the low unemployment rate in the UAE, a large number of citizens can afford a Corolla Hybrid model. Therefore, a joint venture, exportation, and foreign direct investment are all options for the company to enter the country. However, in order to mitigate the potential risks associated with the entry strategies, the company may want to consider increasing its research and putting more emphasis on the quality of its products.
