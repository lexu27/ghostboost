To comprehend the structure and functions of society, one must delve into numerous sociological theories and perspectives put forth by various scientists. Emile Durkheim, a French sociologist, introduced the theory of functionalism, emphasizing the interconnectedness of all societal elements. He likened society to a vital biological organism, positing that every part must work harmoniously for the society to thrive. On the other hand, Karl Marx's conflict theory views society as a battleground of class conflict, focusing on resource distribution disparities and advocating for necessary societal transformations. While Durkheim champions collective conscience and conformity, Marx highlights individualism and societal alienation. These contrasting views make it apparent that functionalism and conflict theory stand in stark opposition to each other, with differing goals and ideologies that make their harmonization nearly impossible.
