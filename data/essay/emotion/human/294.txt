Multiple factors play a role in determining health through grocery purchasing. Among them, income and lifestyle play a significant part in the quality of products bought. Families with low-income often opt for cheaper canned vegetables over fresh ones due to budget constraints. On the other hand, individuals leading a healthy lifestyle or training for athletic goals may choose organic, albeit more costly, products.

Indeed, several factors can influence purchasing habits and food consumption, which are critical for physical well-being. Social determinants of health, such as economic stability, education, access to healthcare, environment, and community context, as outlined by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (Healthy People 2030, n.d.), are key considerations. It is conceivable that education level can also affect grocery choices. For example, someone knowledgeable about nutrition and the adverse effects of unhealthy snacks, sugar, and processed foods on health, will make conscious efforts to avoid these items regardless of their financial status.
