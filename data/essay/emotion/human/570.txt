The similarities between the opportunities of simple citizens and the residents of the Capitol present the pressing issue of social class differences in The Hunger Games. However, the most tragic thing that happens to people is that they are exploited for the amusement of those from the upper class. Overall, Suzanne Collins underlines the social injustice between the residents of the twelve districts of Panem and the wealthier part of society in the Capitol, emphasizing the brutality of the so-called hunger games.
To start, the narrative centers around two characters, Peeta and Katniss, who reside in the twelfth district of Panem and endure the Capitol’s ruthlessness. Specifically, their neighbors are famished and must toil tirelessly to earn money just to sustain their families, “District Twelve. Where you can starve to death in safety” (24). Katniss’s family is extremely impoverished, so she is compelled to hunt in forbidden territories to procure food for her sister and mother. Her family lacks basic amenities in their home, preventing them from even bathing or properly laundering their clothes. Furthermore, the twelve districts are prohibited from interacting in any capacity, restricting people from traveling outside their regions or acquiring essentials such as food, clothing, and other necessities from different parts of Panem.
In contrast, the Capitol prospers while the people of Panem struggle to survive. Indeed, the upper class exhibits no concern for the citizens' lack of food, designer garments, or technology to enhance their lives. Conversely, nearly every Capitol resident owns luxury cars, mansions, and everything that individuals from the twelve districts could only dream of. The Capitol is rife with malicious and duplicitous individuals; they prioritize appearances and attire over character, “They do surgery in the Capitol to make people appear younger and thinner” (124). Consequently, Collins underscores the Capitol's primary objective, which is to exacerbate the plight of Panem's inhabitants and subject them to suffering (38). The twelve districts are deprived of access to quality education because the Capitol cannot tolerate any dissent or individuals questioning their authority.
Nevertheless, the Capitol's premier annual entertainment is the hunger games, where two representatives from each of the twelve districts are chosen to battle for survival. The competition concludes when only one out of the 24 participants emerges alive. Ironically, Catniss is coerced to take her sister's place, who is selected at random during the selection ceremony. Catniss and her fellow district member fight for survival while the Capitol observes their ordeal on television, taunting, “Happy Hunger Games! And may the odds be ever in your favor” (78). The most distressing aspect is that the upper class views it as an honor for participants to be showcased and even provided with essentials if sponsored during the games. In essence, the Capitol prioritizes its own welfare and exploits ordinary individuals from the lower classes in the districts for entertainment, subjecting them to starvation, evading opponents' traps, and killing to endure this nightmare.
In conclusion, Suzanne Collins depicts the harsh reality that the people of Panem confront daily, striving to survive and support their families while the Capitol thrives on their hardships. The Capitol denizens perceive themselves as superior beings and believe it is acceptable to inflict suffering on their fellow human beings merely for their pleasure. The perpetual dread of the Capitol instills constant terror in Panem, transforming Catniss into a courageous hero who battles for her people without fearing the consequences.
