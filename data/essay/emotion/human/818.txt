Written in the middle of the twentieth century, the novel A Confederacy of Dunces remains relevant these days. The book unveils some of the features of the people who cannot find their place in their communities or human society at large. Ignatius J. Reilly, the protagonist of the story, is one of such individuals incapable of fitting in. Some may note that the man is just one of the thousand inhabitants of New Orleans trying to live his life and become happy. At that, he is not an eccentric man with slightly standing out peculiarities but a person suffering from a mental health issue with vivid symptoms. Ignatius can hardly become a part of his community, although he has to try hard due to economic struggles that started after his irresponsible behavior. It has been widely discussed that Ignatius shares many traits in common with the author of the book as John Kennedy Toole also failed to become a successful member of his community and American society. At that, while the writer committed suicide, unable to fit in, he gives Ignatius a chance to succeed. Ignatius J. Reilly can be seen as a good illustration of the behaviors and choices of people with antisocial personality disorder who are doing their best to find a place in their communities.
