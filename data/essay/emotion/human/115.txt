Burke’s pentad introduces a straightforward tool for analyzing dramatic situations, allowing for the examination of texts and narratives through the elements of act, agent, scene, agency, and purpose. This framework serves to uncover an actor's motivation within a given dramatic context. For instance, by examining one of Jeff Wall’s photographs, we can see how an actor's motivation can be perceived differently depending on the viewer’s perspective.

Kenneth Burke’s philosophy centers on key principles that shed light on human behavior. He emphasizes the significance of language in guiding conscious actions rather than reflexive responses. According to Bonanno (2018), acts are intricately tied to the neurological aspect of human existence, emphasizing the body's ability to navigate the realm of symbols.

By structuring his discourse around the principles of drama, the rhetorician breaks down human actions into five core elements: act, agent, scene, agency, and purpose (Hawhee & Poole, 2019). These components form the basis of rhetorical analysis, offering a multidimensional view of human behavior. Within this framework, individuals are portrayed as purpose-driven actors who operate within a historical context. Jensen (2018) notes that Burke believed each individual can shape their life through actions, with the pentad serving as a guide to understanding motivations.

Furthermore, the connections established by the rhetorician between these dramatic elements play a pivotal role in shaping the narrative and identifying key themes (Jensen, 2018). In the realm of communication, the exchange of ideas between characters reflects a continuous effort to grasp the intentions of the speaker (Lynch, 2017), strengthening the ties between the actor and other elements of the dramatic setting.

The application of Burke’s pentad hinges on the viewer's focal point. Whether analyzing paintings or photographs, this framework offers a lens through which to interpret visual art. Taking Jeff Wall's 1986 photograph, "The Thinker," as an example, we can identify the elements at play: an old man as the agent, seated and gazing into the distance, against the backdrop of an empty early morning cityscape, with the purpose of meditation.

In dissecting such scenes, viewers construct narratives based on available information, with interpretations varying based on individual perspectives. However, a deeper understanding, such as recognizing Wall's reinterpretation of a famous sculpture, can reshape the actor's motivation and relationships with other elements. Moreover, the photographer themselves can step into the role of author or rhetor, leading to a nuanced analysis of motivation and connections within the scene.

Ultimately, Burke’s pentad serves as a tool to unearth an actor's motivation in a specific dramatic context, with the interplay of elements shaping the insights drawn from this framework. By delving into the components of a scene, viewers can unravel the driving forces behind actions, exemplified through the exploration of Wall’s photograph showcasing how an actor's motivation can shift based on contextual elements.
