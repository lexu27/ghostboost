It is frustrating that immigrants or citizens with non-white ancestry had to prove their value before white Americans accepted them as equals. Unfortunately, the emergence of such movements as Black Lives Matter shows that some non-white ethnic groups still face discrimination. Therefore, new immigrants often suffer from ethnic intolerance like their predecessors did, as their languages and cultural values are considered inferior, or they do not get the same vocational and educational opportunities.
