The study of philosophy can challenge a person’s problem-solving skills and broaden one’s perspective to aspects of life beyond material science. Philosophical skills enable scholars to explore ideas, definitions, arguments, and issues that impact how life is perceived. These skills contribute to the ability to structure thoughts, deal with matters of importance, and extract essential information from vast sources. Philosophy significantly enriches the educational experience by demanding intellectual engagement. This essay argues that philosophy is essential in higher education as it exposes scholars to diverse world views on thought frequency, vibration, and energy. In higher education, philosophy involves familiarizing oneself with key historical figures and advancements in ancient times, mastering current methodologies, and grappling with philosophical dilemmas. Exposure to philosophical concepts helps scholars cultivate critical, analytical, and observational abilities that are invaluable in the broader context of life.

Philosophy plays a crucial role in fulfilling four criteria that should form the foundation of any institution of higher learning. These fundamental skills include instilling basic thinking patterns in students and enhancing their abilities in text interpretation, writing, and effective communication. These skills are vital for shaping cultural identities and encouraging scholars to explore profound questions about reality, knowledge, and significance. Certain key characteristics distinguish a scholar as a proficient philosopher prepared to engage in constructive debates that influence everyday decision-making. Open-mindedness, skepticism, and a systemic thinking approach are among the most prominent traits.

Open-mindedness is a critical quality that distinguishes a scholar as a philosopher. It is not merely about one’s opinions but about the willingness to reassess them under appropriate circumstances. Genuine humility in acknowledging fallibility and adjusting perceptions of existing issues is essential for open-mindedness. This virtue acts as a counterbalance to confirmation bias, a cognitive error that can hinder reasoning and analysis of information and arguments.

A proficient philosopher must also embody a healthy level of skepticism, which encourages further exploration and scrutiny of information presented in discussions. Skepticism involves challenging knowledge claims across various fields of philosophy and questioning the foundations and validity of these claims. Adopting a critical mindset helps scholars demand justifications for ethical claims and avoid blindly accepting authority without considering alternative viewpoints.

Furthermore, a paradigmatic philosopher should exhibit a systemic approach to thinking when addressing life's complexities. Systems thinking, rooted in systems philosophy, involves understanding a system by examining the relationships and interactions among its components. This approach proves particularly beneficial when tackling intricate or challenging problems. Philosophers like Socrates exemplify aspects of systemic thinking, emphasizing the importance of comprehending the underlying structure and components of a system to predict future outcomes effectively.

Socrates emerges as a model scholar who views philosophy as the application of logic and reason in the pursuit of knowledge. He asserts that knowledge is attainable through interaction with the environment. Socrates emphasizes that philosophy involves self-examination, exploration of various facets of life, and acknowledgment of one's limitations, as evidenced in Plato's Socratic dialogues.
