The global pandemic has significantly disrupted the usual way of life that people were accustomed to before the outbreak of the harmful virus. The research paper delves into the mental consequences of the infection on students in Saudi Arabia. Specifically, the authors set out to explore whether the shift to a new lifestyle due to the pandemic has affected the anxiety levels of university students.

Naturally, the researchers had to provide a pragmatic analysis to gather data for drawing conclusions about the changes in anxiety levels among students. This led Khoshaim et al. (2020) to survey 400 students from various universities on an online platform, inquiring about their mental well-being and whether they observed any changes in their behavior or outlook because of COVID-19. It's worth noting that the questionnaires were distributed to the students from March to June in 2020, the peak of the pandemic worldwide (Khoshaim et al., 2020). Nevertheless, Khoshaim et al. (2020) found that 35% of the students surveyed were grappling with moderate to extreme anxiety, significantly complicating their academic pursuits. Overall, this study addresses a crucial subject, given that students are still grappling with the repercussions of the changes to global education due to COVID-19.

Regrettably, the outcomes of this study cannot be deemed as conclusive, as students might experience anxiety for various reasons that could influence their responses to the online survey. Nonetheless, this research lays a strong groundwork for future studies with more specific focuses that could delve into the mental health issues among young people resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent restrictions. Furthermore, the government can leverage the gathered data to support students in managing their anxiety levels to improve their academic performance and well-being.
