The current global landscape of the agricultural economy is composed of large companies. Their dominance dictates policies and standards, leading to environmental damage, human rights violations, and poverty. Consumer habits can promote industry diversity, but other interventions are needed, with government involvement being crucial.

The most intriguing aspect for me was how the agricultural market's size was achieved. Technological advancements drove this expansion, increasing supply by automating harvests and enabling companies to pre-sell crops. However, these actions often overlook their impact on the environment, poverty, and farmers.

Another notable factor in the market's rapid growth was the evolution of food retail. Retail operations now heavily influence purchasing behaviors and product availability, particularly in developing and developed countries. The market size determines a firm's influence on consumer choice and supplier selection, perpetuating monopolization that ignores modern agricultural issues.
