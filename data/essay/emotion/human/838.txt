Nursing is a frequently undervalued profession that plays a vital role in the efficient operation of a hospital. Despite the established significance of nursing theory in real-life scenarios, there exists a substantial gap between theory and practice. This gap often leads to staff following established customs without fully comprehending their rationale, resulting in potential issues with motivation, credibility, and patient care quality. Understanding the historical background of nursing practices is crucial for addressing these challenges and adapting to new situations effectively.

The evolution of nursing practice can be traced back to Florence Nightingale, who challenged societal norms to provide assistance during wars in the 19th and 20th centuries. The profession has since undergone significant changes, including the introduction of formal education, increased responsibilities for nurses, and the establishment of safety and quality standards to ensure optimal patient care.

Key figures such as Florence Nightingale, Clara Barton, Mary Breckinridge, Dorothea Dix, Margaret Sanger, Mary Mahoney, Walt Whitman, Lillian Wald, Mary Seacole, and Virginia Avenel Henderson have each made unique contributions to shaping the nursing profession. Their dedication and innovation have had a lasting impact on healthcare delivery and patient outcomes.

Public trust and expectations in nursing play a crucial role in patient care. Addressing the negative perceptions of nursing staff and building trust between patients and caregivers are essential for enhancing the quality of care provided. Increased visibility of nursing practices and efforts to strengthen patient-caregiver relationships are necessary steps to improve the overall healthcare experience.
