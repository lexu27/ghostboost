Drivers are prohibited from using handheld devices at red lights because distractions can lead to accidents. The State of Georgia has a law in place to prevent drivers from holding wireless devices while driving. Although there are exceptions, such as reporting emergencies, the focus should always be on road safety. Research shows that using phones while driving decreases awareness and reaction time, potentially causing delays and accidents. Therefore, it is crucial for drivers to prioritize their attention on the road at all times, even when stopped at red lights.
