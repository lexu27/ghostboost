The crime of extortion involves both a criminal act and a criminal intent. The criminal act typically involves using threats to obtain property from someone else. These threats can relate to the victim's health, property, or reputation. For example, a criminal might demand payment from a victim under threat of exposing private photos. However, without the intent to steal, such threats may not constitute extortion.
In extortion cases, the criminal intent is usually to gain money or property unlawfully. This intent must be present at the time of the threat. The act of making the threat is enough to fulfill the intent, without the actual theft being necessary. For instance, if someone asks for a loan and then threatens to expose photos after being refused, the necessary criminal intent for extortion may be lacking.
A defense against extortion could involve showing that the money or property taken with threats was taken fairly, such as in the case of compensation. For example, if an employee threatens harm to receive unpaid wages, it may not be considered extortion. Educational programs addressing cyberviolence risks and digital security measures can help individuals protect themselves from such crimes, as extortion has become increasingly prevalent in cyberspace.
