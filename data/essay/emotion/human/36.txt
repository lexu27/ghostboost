In more than two decades, Amazon has altered the way consumers perceive online shopping. Prior to the introduction of Prime in 2005, two-day shipping was practically non-existent. Nevertheless, today, countless people are utilizing this service. Initially, complimentary two-day shipping was Prime's main attraction. Yet, as Amazon grew, the offer of free two-day shipping came with numerous restrictions. For instance, the company does not ship small items like razors or hair ties separately. Instead, customers must buy $25 worth of goods before Amazon dispatches those items. Customers are dissatisfied with such terms. Del Valle (2019) suggests that the Prime service is akin to a trick that lulls shoppers into a false sense of security until they reach the checkout and spot a much delayed delivery date. This approach benefits the company by cutting delivery costs.
To comprehend its intentions, it's crucial to scrutinize Amazon's warehousing. With the rise of the pandemic, consumers are increasingly turning to online shopping. Waddell and Singh (2021) observe that between 2015 and 2019, Amazon established an average of about 75 new warehouses annually, varying from large warehouses and fulfillment centers to numerous smaller delivery stations. Consequently, in 2020, Amazon inaugurated nearly 300 new facilities, enabling users to reduce the waiting time for a product.
In addition to the quantitative aspect, it is vital to examine the qualitative side. According to Organized chaos: Behind the scenes of Amazon's inventory management system, Amazon has developed a carefully planned warehouse ecosystem that also expedites delivery. Hence, products arriving at the warehouse are sorted not by category, as is customary in most systems, but by available free space. For instance, a single tube of toothpaste could be stored alongside a car battery. Bowersox (2019) points out that this accelerates both the product placement process and the order-picking process. Additionally, this storage method allows for efficient use of warehouse space. Furthermore, robotics are utilized in warehouses, further hastening the process.
Consumer Reports investigated Amazon's warehousing, yielding the following deductions. According to Waddell and Singh (2021), firstly, Amazon erects most of its warehouses in areas with relatively large populations of people of color. Nationally, 69% of Amazon warehouses have more people of color residing within a one-mile radius than the average area in their urban regions. Second, 57% of Amazon's warehouses are situated in areas with substantial numbers of low-income residents. Consequently, Amazon is constructing numerous warehouses in regions with affordable land, aiding in cost savings, expanding outlets, and catering to more consumers. Thus, in terms of the financial aspect, the company reaps significant advantages.
Nevertheless, several other issues stem from such a warehouse management approach. Waddell and Singh (2021) assert that people of color and low-income residents bear the brunt of Amazon warehouses. This is evident in heightened air pollution from trucks and vans, riskier streets for children, and other quality-of-life concerns such as traffic congestion and nearly constant noise. Amazon is profiting from a historical legacy of discriminatory policies that have segregated cities across the nation for decades and have disproportionately affected the health and environment of communities of color. Consequently, the proliferation of massive warehouses in numerous communities exacerbates existing problems, ranging from noise to localized air pollution.
