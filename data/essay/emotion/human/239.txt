Emergency management involves developing a structure within the population to decrease exposure to risks and cope with catastrophes. Regular training, simulations, equipment evaluation, and community coordination in a crisis are essential aspects of emergency preparedness. Various calamities like forest fires, tremors, hurricanes, accidents, bombings, dangerous chemicals events, snowstorms, and flooding fall under emergency management. Mitigation, readiness, reaction, and restoration are the four primary stages in this framework. Society benefits from the mitigation phase since it aids in minimizing human and financial costs.

The preparation stage aims to respond to a crisis quickly through planning, administering, coordinating, training, equipping, regulating, evaluating, and improving operations. The reaction stage involves organizing relevant emergency services and planning for first responders efficiently. The recovery period focuses on rehabilitating the impacted region.

Civil defense safeguards civilians from imminent catastrophic situations and restores critical services and property in an assault. Disaster defense protects people against natural calamities using principles like prevention, abatement, preparedness, reaction, evacuation procedures, and reintegration.

In contrast, emergency management aims to safeguard people, property, and governments from threats. Plans evolved from addressing the danger of war to focusing on widespread tragedies and crises. The shift in attention post-Cold War led to terms like crisis response, disaster prevention, emergency preparedness, recovery plans, civil aid, and public security.
