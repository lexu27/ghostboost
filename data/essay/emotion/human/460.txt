Panama's national currency, the Balboa, is named after Spanish explorer Vasco Nez de Balboa, who discovered the Pacific Ocean. The Balboa is equivalent to one U.S. Dollar, which has been officially accepted in Panama. While Panama is often considered highly inflationary, it can also benefit from the stability of the U.S. dollar in global banking. This means Panama is less susceptible to hyperinflation due to fluctuating exchange rates, making it an appealing destination for investments and tourism. However, the dollarized system may not fully shield against global economic shocks. The reasons behind Panama's loose monetary policies remain unclear, possibly influenced by dollarization or the competitive banking sector's globalization.

The country's strategic location as a key maritime route further emphasizes the importance of the Agreement. Two-thirds of the Panama Canal's annual transits involve U.S. destinations. Initially, most U.S. automotive and commercial goods shipped to Panama will be duty-free, with tariffs gradually phased out over ten years. Various U.S. products, including information technology, agriculture, machinery, aircraft parts, healthcare, environmental goods, medicines, fertilizers, and agrochemicals, will have immediate duty-free access. Both the U.S. and Panama engage in trade of commodities like corn and bananas, enhancing their economic ties.
