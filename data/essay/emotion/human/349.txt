ACL injuries can have severe consequences for patients, limiting their movements and impeding daily routines. The ACL, located in the middle of the knee joint, is vulnerable to overextension and tears. Most patients with ACL injuries require professional medical help and surgery for ACL reconstruction. Although bone-patellar tendon-bone autografts are commonly used for ACLR, some long-term complications, such as anterior knee pain and kneeling pain, can affect patients' lifestyles. Studies aim to determine the incidence of these complications in the Saudi Arabian population. Anterior knee pain is a frequent postoperative complication after ACL reconstruction with a BPTB graft, affecting patients' daily routines. Research focuses on identifying means to reduce or mitigate these complications, including graft choice and surgical techniques. Some studies suggest that BPTB grafts may lead to a higher incidence of complications compared to other graft options.
