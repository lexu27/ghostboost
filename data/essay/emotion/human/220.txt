One of the main goals of a leader in a business is to determine the best course of action from the available options during the decision-making process. Undoubtedly, this cannot be achieved without a deep understanding of a company's business environment. When it comes to introducing products to the market for consumer consumption, a theory that experts commonly refer to is the supply and demand theory. This theory is employed to comprehend customers' purchasing behaviors and assist managers in formulating market strategies accordingly. For example, a lack of demand for a product indicates the need to reduce supply, and conversely, when demand increases, it is logical to increase the supply of goods as well. Furthermore, analyzing supply and demand aids in pricing strategies: when demand is high, customers are more likely to accept price hikes and continue purchasing. Conversely, in the case of low demand, prices should be kept affordable; otherwise, the producer will incur losses.

There are various tactics to leverage the supply and demand model to one's benefit. Dayton provides an example involving De Beers, a company specializing in diamond jewelry. Despite having vaults filled with diamonds, they maintain high gem prices by restricting supply, ensuring that diamonds remain a scarce commodity for which customers are willing to pay as a status symbol. Another organization that effectively applies the supply and demand theory is Zappo. Dayton explains that the company initially faced skepticism over its concept of selling shoes online without the option of trying them on first. Nevertheless, Zappo achieved success by controlling supply through their extensive product range, exceptional customer service, and favorable return policy, which consistently attracts buyers. Lastly, there is Apple, a prominent player in the technology industry. By building anticipation for service or product launches, they create demand that makes customers feel part of something more significant than just another gadget hitting the market. In essence, the supply and demand theory can be a valuable tool for navigating the market; individuals just need to explore effective ways to utilize it to their product's advantage.
