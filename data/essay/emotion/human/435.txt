Chapter 5 of the book discusses the condition of native women during the colonial conquest of the Americas. The invasion of South and North America by the Europeans had a significant impact on the local egalitarian societies. The Algonquian tribes underwent substantial changes in their social and economic structure (Hughes & Hughes, 1997). Prior to the invasion, both men and women in the tribe shared work and responsibilities equally. However, after the conquest, the demand for men's work, such as hunting large game, increased due to European influence. Additionally, trade with the invaders rendered some of the women's tasks obsolete, as European goods replaced their creations. The arrival of Catholic Jesuits aimed to establish a patriarchal society and primarily baptize tribal men. Many women resisted conversion to Christianity, but they faced physical violence from their male relatives for defying God.

In New Mexico, where the Spanish relied on the slave trade for wealth, numerous Indian women were enslaved and treated as property without any rights. In Barbados, black female slaves were forced into labor in fields and subjected to various forms of exploitation, including physical, sexual, and emotional abuse. In New Spain, the Spanish conquerors imposed their cultural norms and regulations on women, emphasizing sexual purity and discretion. Consequently, native women were often subjected to rape and sexual abuse by the Spanish to uphold their traditions. Furthermore, the local population adopted Spanish values of honor, resulting in further exploitation of native women.

Chapter 6 of the book delves into the role of African women in the 17th century. A Lutheran pastor who visited the Fetu people in the 1660s described their societal customs. According to the pastor, Fetu women dressed according to their social status and wealth. Wealthy women adorned themselves in silk to cover their breasts, while poorer women remained topless (Hughes & Hughes, 1997). Weddings within the tribe were festive occasions where bridegrooms displayed their generosity. Men had the option to have multiple wives, with the first wife holding the highest status while concubines were often enslaved women. The Bakongo tribe in Kongo had a unique social structure where women could be designated as wives or sisters. Wives were expected to bear children, and after their childbearing years, many transitioned to the status of sisters. Sisterhood implied autonomy and active involvement in family affairs, which was denied to slave women who were only recognized as wives.

The chapter also narrates the story of Queen Njinga, a formidable leader who resisted the Portuguese in Kongo following her brother's death. To assert her position as queen, Njinga adopted masculine traits. As a noblewoman, she had the privilege of having multiple husbands and instructed them to dress in female attire. Njinga proved to be a successful ruler, leading her forces in battles and defending against Portuguese attacks. The chapter also sheds light on Eur-African women born to European fathers and African mothers. These women held a marginalized status in African societies due to the lack of recognition from the native population. Consequently, Eur-African women like Betsy Heard leaned towards their European fathers, who provided them with a European education. Through marriage to other Europeans, Eur-African women gained resources and status, enabling them to serve as intermediaries in the slave trade.
