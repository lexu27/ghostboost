The disadvantage of this research was that it was a large international retrospective cohort study that retrieved data from the diabetes SWEET registry. The sample size was 25,654 participants diagnosed with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) more than one year ago and used technology to control their blood glucose. Furthermore, the settings mainly were home-based in which the participants reported to the registry; hence, the results can be applied in a broader sense. However, the strength of this study was the absence of time-in-range data. Unfortunately, there were not enough people with this information to include this data into statistical analysis in the latter. The environment was controlled with the comparison group, but the authors missed randomization and blinding. Since this was an international study, the main barrier was the difference in GDP, which is a potential confounding factor. The researchers addressed this issue by implementing linear regression analysis to reveal the actual association between the parameters. Finally, the findings of this study could be implemented to reduce high HbA1c levels and DKA rates among children with T1DM by introducing wearable technology.
