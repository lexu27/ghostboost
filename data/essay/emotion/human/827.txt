When discussing Parkinson’s Disease (PD), the patient’s care, both from the community and healthcare professionals, is a concern. Therefore, my topic of interest is the care and treatment of people suffering from PD and how their lives could be improved. I chose this topic because it is empathetic seeing patients struggling independently without proper care from the community and the healthcare. The topic is a matter of concern because helping the vulnerable in the community creates an inclusive environment for all. Moreover, caring for PD patients is a health concern issue because, without proper intervention, patients suffering from this condition could develop worse conditions and adversely affect their lives. I believe that PD is treatable, and patients put under proper medication show minimal difficulties coping with their lives. In researching the topic, the keywords to use are ‘appropriate caring for patients with Parkinson’s Disease, which yields a variety of nursing journals to choose from.
* P – Patients and people affected by Parkinson’s Disease (PD).
* I – How does collaborative care and disease education help to improve care management among patients who have Parkinson’s Disease? Is it worth educating members of society about PD? And what effects could it bring to patients suffering from this condition?
* C – Compares to patients’ data with no collaborative care and victims surrounded by uninformed people about the disease.
* O – Improves PD patients’ care management and care in general.
* T – Over a 24-week time frame.
For the sustainability of this project, it is important to provide supporting evidence on the importance of collaborative and disease education among the community members. Therefore, I intend to exhaust several nursing journals concerning caring for people and patients with Parkinson’s Disease. The targeted nursing journals whose content presents the importance of PD education and studies promoting collaborative care for these victims. This project aims primarily to prove the importance of PD education and the need for awareness of this condition in the community. Finally, at the end of the specified period, the behaviors and the ease of coping with the condition among PD patients will be compared with stored data when the community was not informed of the PD. Therefore, there is a high expectation of a positive result regarding efficient care and ease in managing PD patients.
My research concerning PD patients’ care continues as I found this article as important as the two discussed articles. This article’s main point is shifting care of the PD patients from hospitals to community care. According to Aye et al. (2020), integrated multidisciplinary care in collaboration with other healthcare professionals is the key to managing PD patients and their conditions. Moreover, the article presents insufficient expertise, poor interdisciplinary collaboration, and communication to deliver care to PD patients as the core challenges facing the shifting process. Since full shifting to community patient-centric care would be difficult, the research proposes programs such as PD training and Telemedicine to make the dream true shortly (Aye et al., 2020). This article further narrows down and points out the role of multidisciplinary care in PD and the limitations exhibited by PD patients in the community. This research was based on Singapore’s PD model of care. According to Aye et al. (2020), PD is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, as the research found that more than 6000 people are diagnosed with the disease. Hence over congestion of PD patients forced the birth of Patient-Centric Care outside the hospitals.
In my opinion, I found this source biased as caring for persons suffering from PD is concerned. The article does not explain the programs that ensure that these patients receive the utmost care outside the hospitals. Moreover, without proper education and the provision of Telemedicine, many homes that care for PD patients would have a hard time as they do not receive quality care. However, I agree with moving PD care from hospitals to the community because various hospitals do not have sufficient facilities to handle the figures quoted in the case of Singapore. In doing so, caregivers and other healthcare professionals find it easy to care for patients with adverse PD conditions. Reading the article gives insights and knowledge of PD and the reason for ultimate patient care. With the increased PD condition, this matter is a nursing situation and a global matter of concern to help reduce and care for these vulnerable.
Therefore, it is important to note that all three discussed articles build on the consensus that persons diagnosed with PD deserve the utmost care to better their lives. The three articles agree that PD is a chronic neurodegenerative disease with complex motor and non-motor symptoms. Moreover, the articles have stressed the importance of caring for caregivers and the community. The articles also give insights into how PD persons and their families could be supported to better their existence in the community. A good example is teaching programs in the community. This creates PD awareness in the community and enhances patients’ care knowledge. Although the articles agree on some aspects concerning PD patient care, the second article dwells on the relationship between educating the public on PD and the burden of caregiving. The finding showed that with
