The positive tone of the excerpt of O’Brien’s “Good Form” is set using specific word choices and stylistic devices. The author used engaging, descriptive words to vividly portray the scenes and guide the reader into feeling a connection with the main character. For instance, the deceased young man was depicted as elegant and delicate. The author incorporated anaphora multiple times to highlight the significance of the imagery he presents, such as “real bodies with real faces” and “faceless responsibility and faceless grief.”
Amy Tan wrote “Fish Cheeks” about a heartwarming Christmas Eve gathering and a cultural celebration. The main character of the excerpt is amused by her family and her own culture in front of guests. Her amusement is conveyed through the word-choice used to depict the actions of her relatives, followed by the reaction of her guests and her own wish to join in. For example, the girl compares her relatives licking the ends of their chopsticks to her guests eagerly waiting for the plate to be passed to them. Words like plucked, poked, and belched are used to describe her father’s gestures, portraying them as entertaining and endearing.
The except of Yusef Komunyakaa’s “Facing It” illustrates the vivid images and reflections that cross a veteran's mind while gazing at the names on a memorial. Recalling some of the names evokes poignant scenes of those individuals passing away before the main character’s eyes. The reminiscences are captured in one line of the poem, symbolizing how swiftly they emerge. For instance, upon touching the name of Andre Johnson, the veteran shares a vision of the booby trap’s bright flash with the reader, signifying the loss of his comrade. In this way, the reader is able to experience the same thoughts and visions as the veteran, as if they endured the same challenges and fears of war.
