The care ethics theory was thoroughly praised based on the concept of slave morality. This idea was developed by Nietzsche and declares that discriminated people often create the mindset that enables them to treat their forced servant behavior as a kind of virtuous manners. Thus, the urge and readiness to provide care are viewed as a positive trait that empowers individuals.
The other praise of care ethics lies in the notion that provided help is often inclusive. Namely, the caregivers prioritize their relatives, friends, and the citizens of their country but also extend support to other people who need help and are distant from the organized help centers. Therefore, supporters believe that caregivers are compassionate and provide their services to all in need.
The integration of reason and emotion is significant for understanding care ethics. As Held (1997) declares, “a genuinely universal … moral theory would be one that would take account of the experience and concerns of women as fully as it does the experience and concerns of men” (p. 99). She claims that care ethics should embrace the emotional context in moral guidelines, alongside traditional pure reasons of Kantian Imperative and Utilitarianism.
Furthermore, public and private spheres and moral behaviors that are appropriate are also part of care ethics. It is stated in the work of Held (1997) that “gender bias has distorted previous conceptions of these spheres, and we [feminists] are trying to offer more appropriate understandings of “private” morality and “public” life” (p. 102). This citation suggests that public and private are closely connected. People should act in similar ways in both environments while not reinforcing any gender stereotypes about the natural behavior in these surroundings.
