Mark Hendrickson’s article titled “Advance agent of expanding empires: George F. Becker and mineral exploration in South Africa and the Philippines” delves into the geologist’s role in shaping the American imagination of imperial expansion. The first few paragraphs of the article vividly depict the period when the British Empire faced the consequences of its flawed colonial politics, particularly in South Africa, marred by constant conflicts with the local Boer government. With this backdrop, the author skillfully steers readers' attention towards George Becker, who operated in the tumultuous South Africa rife with gold mines and political instability. He also ventured into the Philippines post the Spanish defeat by Admiral Dewey.

The author's central argument seems to suggest that, amidst the United States' evolving global empire, individuals like Becker were deemed essential. These figures were envisioned to enlighten both policymakers and the public about the cultures, traditions, and resources of distant and unfamiliar lands. Hendrickson emphasizes Becker's unique position as an educator within the American political elite of that era. Notably, Theodore Roosevelt, the future 26th president of the United States, held Becker in high regard for his extensive knowledge of the Philippines, encompassing its political landscape.

While I acknowledge the author's standpoint to some extent, Becker's rise to prominence in scientific and political circles was not instantaneous. Following his return from South Africa, a lecture at Columbia University, shedding light on the country's political dynamics, acted as a springboard for his popularity. Subsequently, Becker penned his insights on the root causes of political turmoil in South Africa, which eerily foretold future events.

Becker's expedition to the Philippines, ostensibly for geological purposes, was speculated by Hendrickson to have ulterior motives. It is implied that Becker's mission aimed to justify American intervention and aggression against foreign nations under the guise of enlightenment and civilization.

Despite the validity of Hendrickson's assertions, Becker's character remains contentious. The geologist actively participated in military actions against the Filipino populace, distorting his reports to suit the American audience's preferences at Senator Beveridge's behest. By portraying rebels in a skewed light, Becker altered the American public's perception of their motives and actions.

Becker's portrayal of gold reserves in South Africa not only influenced mining practices but also rationalized British aggression towards the indigenous population. This justification extended to American imperialistic endeavors in the Philippines and beyond, cementing Becker as a key proponent of expansionist policies that shaped the foreign strategies of numerous Western nations towards resource-rich yet vulnerable countries.
