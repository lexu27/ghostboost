The issue of unauthorized termination of life has sparked numerous debates. From a religious perspective, this problem is said to have multiple flaws, with the most significant being the commission of a grave sin before God, who bestows life upon people. Additionally, the adverse effects of euthanasia include the devaluation of human life, the breach of equality among individuals before the law, medical ethics, and the doctor-patient relationship structure. Consequently, it can be inferred that the increasing acceptance of euthanasia will result in a complete loss and reshaping of the human values system. This paper delves into the case study of George, who has been afflicted by a severe illness that will eventually render him completely immobile. Due to overwhelming negative emotions and the realization that the illness is incurable, George contemplates resolving the issue through euthanasia. Thus, through the examination of literary sources, a scientific paper scrutinizes the issue of deliberate death and religious considerations.

In today's world, despite advances in medicine, individuals encounter diseases that sadly do not respond to any treatment. In such instances, the physical and mental toll inflicted by the disease can be challenging to endure. Due to the apprehension of losing independence and dignity, individuals contemplate euthanasia or voluntary suicide. However, this assertion conflicts with the efforts of God to restore the Christian faith. Therefore, this scientific paper explores a thematic investigation concerning a man who has lost hope and is contemplating euthanasia.

The pivotal case study underpinning this research paper narrates the account of a middle-aged man named George. He leads a typical life, works, spends time with his family, and pursues personal interests. However, one day, George begins to experience muscle weakness and a lack of muscle coordination. Subsequently, he sustains an injury, and upon consulting a physician, receives a far from favorable diagnosis. Following further tests, George is diagnosed with the severe and dreadful disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). This disease manifests through the impairment of brain nerve cells responsible for muscle and spinal cord functions. While this condition leads to complete immobilization, senses such as smell, touch, sight, hearing, and taste remain intact.

George learns that ALS currently lacks a cure, and its progression can only be managed with certain medications, as scientists have yet to discover ways to halt the disease. This news plunges George into deep shock and despair, eliciting intense negative emotions and bewilderment. Consequently, George, terrified of becoming wheelchair-bound and burdening his family with meeting his basic needs, contemplates the act of euthanasia to alleviate their burden.

The issue of euthanasia is pressing in contemporary society, with nine regions in the United States legalizing this measure. Proponents of intentional life termination argue that it spares individuals from prolonged agony until death through medical advancements. However, the proliferation of this death method may escalate medical expenses for patients' families due to its limited legalization, rendering euthanasia a costly service. Conversely, Christianity opposes euthanasia, emphasizing that the end-of-life phase should be characterized by love, compassion, reconciliation, and care, elements euthanasia deprives individuals of.

The primary concern regarding euthanasia from a Christian perspective lies in the transgression of God's law. The Christian doctrine asserts that God grants life to individuals and determines when it should end. Euthanasia entails patients choosing their death date, akin to one of the religion's cardinal sins - suicide. Despite the involvement of a specific drug administered by a medical professional rather than the patient, the responsibility for this decision rests with the patient. Sources also underscore that “Doctors may help their patients to die a dignified death from natural causes, but they should not kill their patients or help them to kill themselves” (Anderson, 2015, p. 1). Therefore, in the eyes of religion, this act also constitutes a sin, resembling intentional murder, as it involves deciding to end another's life.

Moreover, scientific literature presents several key reasons against supporting euthanasia. One rationale is the introduction of risk to the vulnerable. Furthermore, granting a doctor the responsibility of ending someone's life can significantly strain the doctor-patient relationship. Additionally, it is crucial to highlight the disruption of familial relationships and the violation of fundamental concepts such as human dignity and legal equality (Anderson, 2015). Echoing the Christian standpoint, individuals should not aid others in ending their lives but provide the requisite care and support to bring solace and peace into the patient's life.

On one hand, following the Christian narrative, George's tribulations can be viewed through the lens of the world's sinful nature. Euthanasia is deemed as suicide and incompatible with religion. Conversely, the fear of losing control over one's life and dignity profoundly impacts the patient. Considering the hope of resurrection, a man's experiences can be seen as yearning for a swift reunion with the divine. Hence, George might feel unwilling to burden his
