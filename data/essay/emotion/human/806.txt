Bottega Veneta is a worldwide famous brand, but its performance might need a boost owing to the company’s recent growth needs. Bottega’s options include product diversification and the production of a new line of items. The company’s brand must be reinvented by emphasizing the significance of quality in daily things and minimizing the level of luxury associated with its products. Bottega will be capable to establish a novel production line by developing the brand impression in a way that relates it to the firm’s principal identity.

Transitioning from a premium company to one that sells things for daily usage is practically impossible. Bottega Veneta, on the other hand, will identify whether all aspects of the corporate communications process are in harmony. Assuring customers that their daily routines are comfortable while adding a touch of luxury, Bottega will be able to develop an entirely new and extraordinarily profitable brand.

Bottega Veneta brands are primarily focused on attracting feminine as well as macho women, as seen by the photographs. The women here are smart and stylish, live in the contemporary world, are self-assured, and sophisticated. Given that Bottega’s women’s fashion trends are mostly irrelevant, the photographs depict ladies who have their own perspective and discern what is best and more importantly, what garments fit them best. Indeed, these women appreciate comfort above everything else and are willing to spend their money on high-end Bottega brand items. Bottega’s consumers prioritize comfort above innovation, but not rejecting the latter. Additionally, the target population is likely to live in the fast lane because of their proclivity for digital technologies.
