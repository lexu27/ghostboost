The topic of the internationalization of companies is a matter that has consistently drawn the interest of researchers in the field of management. In recent years, the focus has shifted from considering the benefits and risks of internationalization to examining the strategies of international companies in operation and growth. However, it is essential to note that globalization serves as a type of institutional environment for global companies, marked by high uncertainty and risks and a non-monotonous, dynamic nature.
The primary driver for the globalization and internationalization of a company is the substantial expansion of market opportunities, including in production and trade.
This is also tied to the advantages reaped from implementing an international strategy, such as the company's market growth, economies of scale and learning, and, of course, the perks of new locations. Many companies from developing countries like China, India, and Taiwan are active in global value chains within high-tech sectors of the economy (Stallkamp & Schotter, 2019).
However, this reality results in the widest array of challenges inherent in international companies in these nations. For instance, emerging markets often lack adequate government oversight and regulatory standards, leading to unethical and criminal trading practices by global companies. A common illustration of this is the exploitation of inexpensive local labor to drive down production costs for international corporations (Mashan, 2021). While this is highly unethical and morally reprehensible, it will have severe repercussions for the company in the future.
Despite the advantages of international diversification, some firms opt not to expand globally for various reasons. Among the most prevalent is the hesitance to venture beyond their home country's domestic market (Paul & Mas, 2019). This indicates either an aversion to confronting the risks of globalization or an initial evaluation of opportunities based solely on domestic market factors. Furthermore, a significant factor in rejecting globalization may stem from an understanding of the challenges encountered in a foreign market, its intricacies, and the culture, religion, and traditions of potential consumers. Hence, the global strategy presents both immense advantages and disadvantages that may dissuade a company from pursuing this approach.
