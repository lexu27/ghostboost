In the Victorian era, most people revered the virtues of society, believing in fixed guiding principles that dictated behavior and morals. Any violation of these standards was seen as unacceptable and deserving of punishment. However, in modern America, these beliefs are seen as outdated and unsuitable. The focus has shifted away from traditional ideals of wisdom, justice, courage, and cleanliness to a more sexualized culture, with practices like prostitution becoming more common.

While Victorian society emphasized moral principles and maintained good behavior, today's world sees a rise in destructive behaviors leading to increased crime rates. The shift from valuing morals to indulging in immoral acts has had a negative impact on societal values.

In the past, women in the Victorian era were often uneducated, immigrants kept to themselves, and societal roles were clearly defined. Today, women are educated, immigrants interact with natives, and traditional gender roles have evolved. The themes in literature have also shifted, with the Victorian era focusing on industrialization, imperialism, and cultural identity, while modern literature delves into loss, despair, and politics.

Both the Victorian era and modern America share a commonality in valuing moral behavior and societal virtues. However, the eras differ in their approach to morality, with the Victorian era emphasizing religion and cultural integrity, while modern society shows a lack of respect for these values.

The impact of these eras is evident in literature, with each period reflecting the societal norms and values of the time. While the Victorian era brought about social change and innovation, modern America seems to have lost touch with the moral compass that once guided society.
