The challenges that firms encounter on their path to internal logistical integration can be categorized into five groups based on their origin and nature. One of these arises from a poorly structured business, leading to inadequate communication among departments. This approach can result in an ineffective corporate culture, lacking unity, morale, and dedication, often seen at the management level as well. Personal experience confirms this; I witnessed disinterest in organizational routines from higher-ups, causing friction among coworkers.

Traditional management and reward systems, stemming from the functional structure, can also hinder internal integration. These systems emphasize individual achievements rather than contributions to the company's overall performance and culture. This can create barriers to effective communication and integration, impacting service quality and customer relations. This lack of cohesion can limit knowledge exchange and impede the integration of new units within the company.

An obstructed flow of information can hinder expansion and partnership opportunities, as traditional structures may not support cross-functionality. The inability to onboard new employees efficiently can impact productivity and hinder growth. Inadequate infrastructure, including transportation, storage, and inventory, can also pose challenges, leading to financial strains and operational inefficiencies. This can be likened to accumulating unnecessary items at home, causing clutter and disruption in business processes.
