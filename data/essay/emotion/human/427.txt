Moral universalism asserts that morality is rooted in an absolute standard. Ethical truth, under this view, is believed to stem from human nature, such as a person's capacity for empathy and the ensuing need for persuasion. While the two moral ideologies are at odds, moral universalism appears to be more accurate.

Numerous arguments can be presented against moral relativism, showcasing a questionable aspect. Initially, despite the compelling nature of arguments in support of relativism, they all contain a logical inconsistency by ultimately advocating for a moral framework that all individuals should adhere to, aligning with moral universalism. Additionally, relativists may claim that different cultures hold different values, implying morality is relative to each individual. However, these arguments ultimately rely on absolute standards to explain people's behaviors, leading back to moral universalism.

Moral universalism presupposes the presence of an ethical structure that effectively governs the conduct of community members, regardless of their background or characteristics. The primary rationale behind this perspective lies in the common foundation shared among various moral frameworks, including respect for life, health, property, and personal integrity. Moral universalism appears to be the more accurate theory. Firstly, moral relativism is centered on exceptions rather than general principles. Human nature largely shapes people's moral and ethical codes across nations and cultures. Fundamental moral standards, such as the prohibition of murder, are universally upheld. Secondly, if each individual were to subscribe to their own moral and ethical beliefs, as moral relativism suggests, it would be unfeasible to regulate human interactions.
