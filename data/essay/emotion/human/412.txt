The debate on whether media has any benefits in learning has been ongoing. Some argue that instructional teaching methods influence learning more than media directly, while others believe that media's attributes play a significant role in learning. Students utilize these attributes to enhance their cognitive development. On the other hand, proponents suggest that media, such as computers and televisions, can enhance learning. This paper will delve into Kozma's perspective on the media debate and explain why his viewpoint is favorable.

Instruction methods play a crucial role in enhancing cognitive processes for effective learning. The economic perspective of media and its attributes is introduced in the argument about whether media positively contributes to learning. If different media or attributes yield similar learning outcomes, the most cost-effective instructional method should be employed. This suggests that media may not have a direct impact on students' learning outcomes.

Kozma's argument highlights learning as a constructive and social process where learners integrate new knowledge with existing knowledge. Media serves as a catalyst in fostering the relationship between learners' cognitive resources and environmental resources. Research evidence, such as the Thinker Tools and Jasper Woodbury Series, demonstrates how media can enhance learning outcomes through dynamic interactions and problem-solving methods.

Overall, integrating media into learning can lead to positive outcomes by effectively aligning instructional methods with educational media. This integration allows learners to connect social contexts with real-world situations, resulting in improved problem-solving skills, retention, and knowledge comprehension.
