Numerous types of reasoning exist and find implementation in decisions affecting patient care, but not all of them bear special significance. Approaches can be classified based on the direction of inquiry, the use of analogy or abduction, decomposition, and evidence synthesis. In the healthcare field, reliance on credible evidence informs the professional community’s approach to clinical reasoning. Frequency-based reasoning dominates the field, especially in guideline development, requiring practitioners to rely on statistics in making clinical decisions. This way of thinking has benefits, including limiting reliance on questionable hypotheses and integrating decisions with the global healthcare knowledge base. To clarify standards for reasoning and determine their levels, relevant evaluative questions must be posed. Distinguishing between the scientific and ethical levels of clinical reasoning is essential. From a scientific perspective, asking questions about the clarity of the thinking process, alignment with previously reported evidence, and relevance to objective client information is important. Questions about the ethical implications of clinical decisions can also support determining levels in reasoning standards. Considering benefits as perceived by the client or their unique socio-demographic situation and psycho-emotional condition is crucial. The degree to which healthcare’s universal ethical values inform the reasoning process is relevant in determining various levels of reasoning standards.
