Social movements are positive forces that advocate for change and provide a platform for marginalized groups to express their voices. They play a crucial role in enhancing democracy by challenging the status quo and promoting political pluralism. For example, the disruptive tactics employed by movements like Civil Rights and Black Lives Matter have effectively raised awareness about racism and inequality, although differences in messaging can impact their outreach. In essence, social movements are essential for ensuring a more inclusive and diverse political landscape.
