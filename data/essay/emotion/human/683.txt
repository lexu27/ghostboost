Treating people is a challenging job, and even the most competent doctor will not be able to handle it alone. Nurses are a crucial link in the medical system and the process of saving the lives of the population. Reflecting on my past, I recall events that led me to the nursing profession. People's experiences shape their character and thoughts significantly, influencing many life choices. My experiences in various situations helped me discover my calling. While these events in my life may seem ordinary, they have been pivotal for me, showing that all occurrences are not mere coincidences.

Concerns about the difficulties and challenges people face, such as global issues, have preoccupied my mind since childhood. I pondered on what could be done to bring about change. This led me to consider changing the world, participating in environmental protests, or inventing technologies to save the ocean. However, despite the importance of these actions, they did not align with my character, as I desired to do something more practical and impactful. These thoughts were the initial inspiration behind my decision to pursue a career in nursing. I believe that medicine and care contribute to making the world a better place. Without them, humanity would not have achieved its current standard of living. Transforming the lives of even one patient for the better is as significant as changing the entire world.

Many of us have experienced illness or hospitalization during childhood. I, too, had to stay in a medical facility for treatment for several days as a child. I was fearful and anxious, especially during the night. However, a nurse managed to calm and support me. She allowed me to call her by her name, Tina, and I felt a sense of friendship with her. I always remembered her with fondness, realizing the value and impact of her actions on a young child. This experience was another factor that motivated me to pursue a career in nursing - knowing that many people in the world, like my younger self, require the same support and comfort.

Dealing with illnesses and injuries is not limited to hospital settings but extends to emergencies in any situation. Family members, friends, or even strangers may suddenly fall ill or get injured, necessitating prompt action where saving a life may hinge on a few crucial seconds. As a teenager, I witnessed my friend breaking his arm. Fortunately, there was someone nearby who could provide assistance, and the ambulance arrived swiftly. However, for a brief moment, I felt powerless and unsure - eager to help without causing harm. This incident further reinforced my decision to pursue a career in nursing. Possessing first aid skills and being able to offer basic assistance, like measuring blood pressure, can be life-saving.

Therefore, multiple significant events and deep reflections have influenced my choice to become a nurse. I recognize numerous benefits in the role of nurses and believe in their unique significance. Saving lives and providing comfort and care to many individuals are my aspirations. Kindness, attentiveness, and support are qualities that our world craves, and embodying these traits can bring about well-being for the populace.
