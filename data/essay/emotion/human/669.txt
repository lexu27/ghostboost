In contrast to the titles of academic journals and articles, it is challenging to determine which field of science an article belongs to from its content, the language used, and the focus of the study. For instance, an article from the humanities delves into peopleâ€™s relationships of communication, satisfaction, and beliefs (Willoughby et al. 1631). These parameters are excessively abstract and relate more to the field of human perception than to precise measurements. The article from the field of social sciences already employs the study of correlations, describing the relationship between phenomena and their influence on each other (Geist 1). Furthermore, the researchers utilize numerous graphs and numbers and concentrate on social and economic contexts. An article from the field of natural sciences no longer relies on statistical data but on the study of various phenomena through the construction of systems and models. For instance, Schacht and Kramer scrutinize the human mating system through the lens of its influence on evolution (2). Consequently, these articles adopt a more experimental design with applications to the global development of the human species.
