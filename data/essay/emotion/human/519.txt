Religion is a fundamental part of most world societies and cultures. There are numerous varieties of religions worldwide with a wide range of differences than similarities. This factor makes it challenging to have an all-encompassing definition of religion that works for all people. The most common traits among the religions include the focus on supernatural or sacred power, ritual acts, and moral codes. Some regions are easily recognized globally, while others are confined to a particular region or country. For instance, Shinto is a Japanese religion widely practiced by that country’s nationals. Although Shinto is a Japanese religion, its myth of origin that supports the divinity of the country’s islands and rulers to ancestral lineage with gods can have a similarity to other religions such as Jewish and Christianity.
