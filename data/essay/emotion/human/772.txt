Despite what happened during WWII, Asia and Asian governments faced severe consequences. The great colonial powers from Europe, weakened by a scarcity of resources, were unable to control their colonies. The emergence of anti-imperialist sentiments at home hindered the decolonization process. Post-WWII, colonies that had supported their colonial rulers gained independence. Some countries that regained independence include the Philippines from the United States of America in 1946, India from the United Kingdom in 1947, Ceylon and Burma in 1948, and others.

Before WWII, Japan aimed to expand its influence over other states. The invasion of Manchuria in 1931 was the beginning of Japanâ€™s East Asian expansion, which escalated in 1937 with a brutal campaign in China. Japan allied with Germany and Italy through the "Axis" when it signed the Tripartite Pact. The United States enforced economic sanctions on Japan to prevent aggression and remove Japanese soldiers from Manchuria and China. With shortages of resources and a goal to challenge the United States in the Pacific, Japan planned to attack US and British forces in Asia for resources. The modernization of post-WWII Japan traces back to the 19th century when Asian states adopted Western culture, enabling them to engage globally and establish relationships, including economic partnerships beyond Asia.
