Korean Popular Culture and the Selling of Place by Youjeong Oh scrutinizes the utilization of K-pop music and Korean dramas to promote the rural and urban places in South Korea. The book presents a critical analysis of how South Korea has aggressively utilized various elements like K-pop, K-drama, K-food, plastic surgery, and tourism to devise multiple strategies. Additionally, it delves into the vital connection between urban planning and Hallyu. The academic perspective highlights how Korean cities leverage television and music productions to enhance their reputation and entice tourists. Through documentation, historical context, and visual aids, the book underscores the narrative of Korean culture.

Pop City explores how pop culture contributes to place promotion within the realms of Korean globalization and political centralization of Korean culture. Local elections in the 1990s fueled cities' aspirations to develop and showcase their rural areas. For instance, Wando County's investment in creating a K-drama using historical sites resulted in a significant boost in tourism and revenue. Similar strategies have been implemented in other rural regions to attract foreign visitors and sponsors. The interaction between local leaders and the political dimension is also highlighted, showcasing how drama sponsorships are driven by political centralization without residents' input.

Moreover, Pop City dissects the process of culture-driven place marketing, emphasizing how urban spaces in Korea are marketed akin to K-pop and K-drama, focusing on striking visuals rather than existing cultural and physical attributes. Despite attempts like that of Anseong City to showcase their cultural richness through investment, challenges arise when taxpayers question the expenditure without thorough public consultation. The book uncovers how K-dramas often portray regions through a lens of pseudohistory and fabricated representations, contributing to the commodification of rural and urban areas.

Additionally, the book explores the global popularity of K-pop, attributing its success to the creation of desirable images that resonate with consumers, fostering a sense of intimacy. The idolized system within K-pop industry plays a significant role in crafting marketable images and products. Through the strategic promotion of idols in various entertainment mediums, consumers are captivated, leading to increased sales of K-pop-related merchandise and experiences.

Furthermore, the book delves into the use of human geography to market Korea's urban areas and K-pop, highlighting the emotional engagement required to attract consumers. It emphasizes the role of emotions such as desire, love, and longing in connecting visitors with K-pop and K-drama sites, fostering a deeper cultural involvement with the physical locations.

Lastly, the book uncovers the expansion of Hallyu through urban connections, showcasing how the Korean culture industry capitalized on the global fame of Hallyu to attract new players and expand its reach. Despite risks associated with oversupply, cultural producers and marketers remain confident in the industry's growth potential. The book offers a unique perspective on the Korean wave, providing valuable insights into the marketing strategies employed to sell Korea's culture and locations on a global scale.
