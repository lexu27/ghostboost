California has passed a bill to reduce the number of prisons. The state considers this a big step towards serious judicial reform, because the number of people in custody will decrease. My research question is to find out how this Realignment was a viable remedy to the California prison system overcrowding. We should care about the question because overcrowding in places of detention is a serious humanitarian problem. Such conditions restrict the rights and freedoms of prisoners. They increase the potential for conflict situations and circumstances that can lead to destabilization of the operational situation inside correctional institutions.
It is important to know the answer to decide whether to apply prison reductions in regions where the problem of overcrowding is particularly sensitive. The confirmation or refutation of the effectiveness of the mechanism used in California depends on its further application to solve an acute problem. When investigating the similar research question previous scholars have found that the reform used in California has serious drawbacks. In particular, when the area of detention was reduced, there was no significant reduction in crime.
The basic themes I use as headings in my literature review area are the humanity of prison reductions, the consequences of reforming the penitentiary system and access to justice. The current research is missing research regarding the assessment of how the implementation of the prison system reform program takes into account the needs of society. In this paper, I will use empirical research methods, namely the study of scientific research and the analysis of the information received. This proposed study will advance knowledge and fill holes in the current research record by focusing on the new aspect of the problem. Instead of using the number of prisoners per square meter as indicators of overpopulation, the conditions of detention will serve as a guideline in this work.
