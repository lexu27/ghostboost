The GBMI verdict is often seen as a controversial phenomenon with little empirical support and sound criticism. It allows for psychiatric treatment and criminal sanctions for defendants deemed mentally ill while guilty of a crime. Introduced to address issues with NGRI acquittees, the verdict aims to prevent early releases and provides treatment alongside punishment. Despite its intentions, the verdict has faced criticism for its potential biases and disparities in mental health support for imprisoned individuals, creating a system with inherent inequities.
