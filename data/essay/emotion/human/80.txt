ESRF is an extremely serious disorder with numerous negative effects on the populationâ€™s health. The decrease in kidney function leads to a disruption of normal life, with various complications arising in response from different body systems. The incidence of ESRF has surged in recent years, affecting more than 1 in 7 adults in the US and with 144 cases per million globally. Furthermore, the mortality rate due to ESRF was 28% worldwide in 2017, with frequent comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, and malignancy. The impact of ESRF on health is undeniably detrimental.

The disease affects the abdominal cavity, home to the kidneys, the primary organs involved. Kidneys gradually lose their functionality, leading to blood filtration failure and issues with blood clotting, prothrombin levels, and thrombocytopenia. The urinary system is primarily affected, struggling to eliminate waste efficiently from the blood. Additionally, changes in the central nervous system may manifest as sleep disturbances, concentration problems, and slowed reactions.

Prefixes like nephro-, hemato-, patho-, and reno- can be used to describe the disease. Nephro- and reno- signify the kidney's failure, hemato- pertains to blood filtration issues, patho- explains the pathologic nature of ESRF, and thrombo- highlights potential blood clotting problems.

ESRF can be described using combining forms like renal, nephric, and nephritic, all relating to the kidney. Other terms like nephrosis, nephrogenic, and renogenic depict the excretory system's origin in or derivation from the kidneys. Conditions such as renal failure are linked to a decrease in hemoglobin levels, impacting hematopoiesis, the blood cell creation process, leading to suppressed blood cell production. Symptoms like skin irritability, anemia, diarrhea, convulsions, and muscle contractions are common in ESRF patients.

Maintaining productivity becomes extremely challenging; persistent fatigue sets in, accompanied by a dry mouth and significant weight loss. Changes in skin texture and color, with increased irritability, are also noticeable.
