Despite the widespread use of digital technology, email has presented some challenges. While it has made communication more convenient, it has also brought about significant changes in how we interact with others. In particular, email has altered the way we perceive interpersonal communication, shifting the focus from face-to-face interactions to online exchanges. This evolution has simplified communication but has also impacted the expression of emotions and body language, which are often lost in text-based conversations. Despite the benefits of increased accessibility and connectivity, email comes with its drawbacks, such as reliance on technology, cybersecurity risks, and the potential for misunderstandings due to the lack of nonverbal cues. To navigate these challenges, it is crucial to adhere to proper digital etiquette, tailor your messages to your audience, and ensure clarity and brevity in your correspondence.
