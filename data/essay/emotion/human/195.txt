The healthcare industry often neglects patientsâ€™ education, particularly for those from minority groups. This is why the article by McCurley et al. (2017) is so crucial. Their research reveals that Hispanic individuals experience enhanced diabetes prevention through individual and group face-to-face sessions. The success of these interventions lies in the ability of patients to seek clarifications and realize they are not alone in their health struggles. This can boost morale, motivating individuals to prioritize preventive measures and well-being.

Considering my practicum project on improving access to care for African Americans with heart failure, face-to-face interventions may not be the only solution. Cajiita et al. (2017) found that mobile technology in healthcare (mHealth) can also enhance knowledge. Their study on 129 older adults, including 25% African Americans, shows that mHealth can be just as effective as face-to-face interactions. Given the prevalence of online activities, leveraging mHealth could be a viable strategy to enhance healthcare access. Combining mobile technologies with in-person educational sessions may yield the most favorable results.
