Healthcare facilities and their staff strive to establish effective emergency preparedness and response interventions to address disasters, terrorist attacks, and pandemic outbreaks. According to McNeill et al. (2018), health emergency preparedness is crucial for public health systems and communities to prevent and respond to healthcare emergencies. With adequate preparedness, healthcare providers are better equipped to manage health emergencies effectively. However, healthcare and emergency preparedness among rural communities remain low despite awareness of upstream readiness and social determinants such as inadequate resources, remoteness, and limited access to healthcare services.

How I Provided Nursing Care that Addressed the Psychosocial Needs of Rural Communities
I provided nursing care to address the psychological needs of rural communities during the pandemic by conducting door-to-door screenings and education on the COVID-19 virus. The primary goal was to dispel myths and misinformation about the virus, its transmission, and the benefits of vaccination. The door-to-door screenings and education played a vital role in advocating for vaccine testing in rural households. On the first day of the activity, our team screened 200 individuals in two villages, with only 3% declining screening services.

During the screening services, our health team encountered an elderly patient struggling to breathe, whom we promptly rushed to the emergency department. After conducting a triage to assess the severity of his condition, we admitted him to the emergency room. I administered chest compressions to help keep the patient alive, following proper technique and protocol.

To address the psychological needs of clients, our health team expanded telehealth services, including telepsychiatry for video communication with rural communities. Telepsychiatry services enabled real-time communication and monitoring of patients, offering essential mental health support during the uncertainties of the pandemic. This intervention played a critical role in integrating behavioral health care with primary care to combat the spread of the virus.

How Social Determinants Contributed to the Health Status of a Vulnerable Client I Served
Social determinants of health, such as poverty, low literacy, and limited access to healthcare, significantly impact the health outcomes of vulnerable populations. Poverty, in particular, played a crucial role in influencing the health status of a vulnerable client I assisted during my practicum. The client's financial constraints hindered regular visits to healthcare facilities for screening and testing, leading to delayed preventive care and seeking treatment only in severe conditions.

Low educational attainment and literacy levels among rural communities also pose challenges, as they are associated with reduced preventive care and increased hospitalization rates. During the pandemic, I observed low adherence to preventive measures like hand hygiene and mask-wearing among individuals with low literacy levels, contributing to higher hospitalization and emergency care utilization rates.

Furthermore, limited insurance coverage in rural communities acts as a barrier to accessing healthcare services, as uninsured individuals may forego preventive care and delay seeking treatment due to high costs. Inadequate insurance coverage exacerbates disparities in care access and leads to poorer health outcomes among rural populations.

The Support Agency I Would Recommend for the Population in Future
For future support, I recommend the Rural Health Care Collaboration and Coordination Guide by HRSA to assist rural communities in addressing their healthcare needs. This support agency facilitates coordination among community health centers, rural hospitals, public health departments, and other stakeholders to enhance access to quality care. By implementing effective care coordination strategies, HRSA aims to improve healthcare access and outcomes for rural populations.

The Greatest Concerns about the Rural Population during Natural Disasters
One of the primary concerns regarding rural communities during natural disasters, such as floods, is their limited access to health services. Floods disrupt access to medical care by damaging infrastructure, including roads and communication lines, restricting healthcare delivery. Additionally, floods heighten the risk of infectious diseases through contamination of water and food sources, further jeopardizing rural communities' health and well-being.

In summary, the health, healthcare, and emergency preparedness of rural populations are influenced by various challenges, including poor coordination, limited funding, and geographical barriers. Factors like environment, income, and literacy play significant roles in determining the health outcomes of rural communities. Efforts to enhance rural community preparedness for healthcare and emergencies should prioritize addressing underlying healthcare determinants through upstream activities to foster resilience.
