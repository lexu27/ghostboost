When the family is given $10,000 in life insurance money, each member of the family has different ideas about how to spend it. Beneatha wants to go to medical school with the money, but Walter’s older brother wants to build an alcohol store. After their mother, Lena, puts a down payment on a new home, the remaining funds are given to Walter, who is instructed to save up a considerable sum for his sister’s medical school tuition.
