While appearing to be simple stories about Damsels in distress, fairy tales are full of hidden messages that impact childrenâ€™s perception of reality and influence their social relationships. Even though many fairy tales have been revised and rewritten over the years, they often remained their archaic and dichotomous worldviews, expressing discriminating gender roles and social norms, reinforced and propagated through a system of reward and punishment. Even in a more global and liberal world, the underlying values of these fairy tales continue to affect children, often unconsciously, for the rest of their lives. This research will explore several fairy tales, written by the Grimm Brothers, such as Cinderella, Snow White, and Briar Rose (Sleeping Beauty) that express, especially controversial social norms and gender roles. Through classroom discussions and performances children reevaluate meanings, scrutinize stereotypes and opinions they may have formed prematurely after first reading the fairy tales. While critical thinking is often considered as a product of education, age, and experience, this research shows that critical thinking is a skill that can be encouraged and actively reinforced at a young age already. The benefits of fostering and implementing critical thinking in young children in the context of fairy tales is especially crucial as critical thinking helps mitigate the strong influence of these fairy tales on the personalities of young children.
