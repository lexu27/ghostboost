Humanity is currently thriving in an era of rapid information and technological progress, with various technologies becoming essential in everyday life. One of the latest concepts is the Internet of Things (IoT), which connects devices to gather and analyze data independently. Despite its invisible presence, IoT plays a crucial role in enhancing efficiency and simplifying tasks across different sectors. However, IoT also poses significant security and privacy risks, as smart devices can easily be compromised, putting personal information in jeopardy.
