The suggested strategies to mitigate the effects of coronavirus in accordance with the example of Iceland could be considered as a concerning approach. This strategy overlooks its apparent limitations, such as the resilience of the Iceland community, geographical idiosyncrasy. However, currently, this strategy might not be an effective method to address the high margins of infected individuals in NATO countries. It is indeed true that quick response and high testing rates would contribute to the deterrence of the effects imposed by the sudden growth of the number of infected. However, it is equally concerning that the population would be reluctant to undergo such a measure. Moreover, despite the financial support efforts, some countries belonging to the organization might struggle to financially withstand the high amount of testing imposed by the new waves of infection. This fact is particularly concerning given that the virus dissemination might emerge across several countries simultaneously.
Therefore, a different approach to the problem might be necessary. The Israeli government approached the problem of monitoring the infected with the unexpected solution of digital epidemiological investigation (Amit et al., 2020). This technology allowed tracking potential contacts of people that were infected and act accordingly (Amit et al., 2020). However, it is debatable that this methodology could address the geographical limitations introduced in the case of Iceland. It would be challenging for NATO countries to strictly monitor all entrances to their borders. Therefore, an analog in the form of digital tracking may exacerbate the problem with the need for strict borders control and provide necessary tools for timely reaction to the new outbreaks. Nevertheless, it would demand funds both internal and external in order to build new or reconstruct the existing infrastructure for the stated purposes.
