The discipline of Networking is the focus of my studies, and I have selected two articles that delve into modern technology. The first article, by Benzaid and Taleb (2020), explores the impact of artificial intelligence on 5G networks. The second article, authored by Zhang et al. (2021), delves into the interoperability of BIM software tools. These articles cater to different audiences - the first article targets data security agents concerned about AI's vulnerability in 5G networks, while the second article appeals to educators in engineering education. Both articles employ scientific methods and delve deep into their respective topics.
Starting with Benzaid and Taleb (2020), they stress the importance of robust security measures in the face of evolving cyber threats in the 5G era. They advocate for the adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a means to bolster security management. On the other hand, Zhang et al. (2021) present a case study highlighting the benefits of incorporating team-based learning and 360-degree evaluation feedback to enhance students' BIM competency.
Benzaid and Taleb (2020) underscore the significance of AI in fortifying security in 5G networks, while cautioning about potential security risks associated with AI. They propose various defense mechanisms to counter adversarial attacks, emphasizing the need for a holistic approach. Conversely, Zhang et al. (2021) emphasize the effectiveness of TBL and 360-degree feedback in enhancing BIM competencies among students.
In conclusion, both articles adopt a logical and evidence-based approach to their respective subjects, aiming to inform and persuade their readers about the importance of their research findings.
