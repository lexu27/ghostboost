There is reason to suspect that the two-nucleotide code evolved into the current triplet genetic code. This suggests that the number of amino acids was slightly less than the current 20 because the two nucleotide codes could only make up 16 amino acids. It is proposed that ancient primitive proteins consisted of fewer amino acids encoded by the two-nucleotide code. Unfortunately, deletion or insertion mutation experiments of one or two nucleotides into a gene did not result in any protein formation (Frank & Froese, 2018). Despite this, the reading frame of the mRNA was only restored when a third nucleotide was deleted or inserted. The current triplet genetic code now consists of 64 codons encoding the twenty amino acids.

The genetic code is labeled degenerate, where a single amino acid can specify more than one codon. Each codon specifies a single amino acid, while amino acids can have more than two codons. For example, tryptophan and methionine have a single codon each except for UGA, UAG, and UAA termination codons. Isoleucine has three codons, while valine, threonine, glycine, proline, and alanine have four codons. Arginine, serine, and leucine have six codons, and the remaining nine amino acids have two codons (Frank & Froese, 2018). The degeneracy feature of the genetic code suggests that in ancient times, there was a two-nucleotide code translating into the 16 amino acids in primitive proteins. The first two bases of each codon exhibit greater specificity than the third, with the connection between the mRNA and tRNA anticodon of the first two bases usually stronger. The third base loosely pairs with its corresponding anticodon base.

A DNA sample with a G + C content of 70 percent will require more temperature than a G + C content of 45 percent to separate its strands. The stability of the DNA double helix, composed of two complementary polynucleotide chains interacting through hydrogen bonds, depends on factors such as chain length, sequence, base composition, and the presence of mismatches. Alterations in temperature can disrupt this stability further. A DNA sample with higher G + C content is more stable than one with low G + C content, as the G + C base pairs are more strongly bonded together (Piovesan et al., 2019). This increased stability raises its thermal melting temperature, requiring more heat energy during the denaturation process to separate the strands. This explains the high melting point of high G + C content DNA.

During polymerase chain reactions, denaturation temperatures for separating DNA double strands are set at 94-95 0 C. The denaturation temperatures are at their peak for DNA samples with higher G + C content to enable quicker strand separation. The set time between 0.5 to 2.0 minutes will also be extended for high G + C content DNA (Piovesan et al., 2019). These instances are due to the stability of DNA with high G + C content base pairing hydrogen bonds. The high stability raises the melting temperatures of high G + C content DNA, requiring higher temperatures for denaturation and a longer time for the process to be effective. Factors like high G + C content composition and longer polynucleotide chains necessitate higher denaturation temperatures compared to low G + C content DNA samples.
