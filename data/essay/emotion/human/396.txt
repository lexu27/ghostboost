The Songs of Song is a portrayal of the value, beauty, and significance of work and love between a man and a woman. The Song narrates stories of an ideal image of family, work, and life by featuring lovers who court, marry, and then work together. King Solomon, who authored the Song, explicitly conveyed themes of hardship, pleasure, beauty, joy, passion, diligence, and family.

At the commencement of the Song, a woman expresses her love for her man. While doing so, she mentions that her skin has darkened due to hard work in the family vineyard. She attributes her labor to her brothers. Although this Song focuses on love, the importance of work is also evident. Furthermore, in the past, dark skin symbolized individuals who labored in the sun for economic purposes. Perhaps they were primarily peasants who held low positions in the economic hierarchy. However, in this Song, the woman's beauty has not diminished due to hard work. As she states in Song 1:5, "I am dark but lovely," King James Version. Additionally, the woman does not regret her work as it has prepared her for the future when she anticipates tending to her own vineyard as well (Song 8:12). Eventually, she will depart from her brothers, marry, and establish her own vineyard.

In many societies, work has often been seen as a hindrance to beauty. However, the biblical view portrayed in the Song presents work as essential to beauty. Not only does King Solomon construct a palanquin for himself, but the Song also praises the beauty of craftsmanship. Therefore, as expressed in Song 3:10, it is a labor of love. Ultimately, the Song emphasizes that work, besides being a means to an economic end, also forms the basis of aesthetic creativity.

In the Song, the woman seeks her beloved, a man she describes as the finest. She learns from her friends that he is at his usual place of work shepherding sheep. However, his work does not hinder their interaction. Their work arrangement allows them to freely engage as a family. This contrasts with the current work environment where family time is dictated by job requirements and the employer's discretion.

The man and woman declare their devotion to each other through the Song. He praises her flawless beauty, and she sings of her deep love for him. As spring arrives, they rejoice in its splendor, and he invites her to his abode. In ancient Israel, spring was a time for farm work, pruning crops for a successful harvest. It was also when young grapes were vulnerable to foxes and other animals. The two lovers find delight in driving away the foxes from the farms. This paints a beautiful picture of finding joy and contentment in work.

A discerning observer will notice that this type of work contradicts what God told Adam in Genesis 3:17-19. After Adam sinned, God cursed the ground, decreeing that food would only come from it through painful labor. It is evident from this verse that this was not God's original intention for work. Therefore, the work illustrated in the Song exemplifies how God desires people to live and work. It fulfills Isaiah's prophecy, "They will build houses and inhabit them; they will plant vineyards and eat their fruit" (Isaiah 65:21). This indicates that God's kingdom does not entail the elimination of work but rather its execution within joyful relationships.

The Song also touches on the concept of marriage between a man and a woman. The woman desires the man, and in an elegant palanquin, she goes to him. He, in turn, receives her wearing a crown, indicating a beautiful wedding ceremony to officiate their love. After the wedding, they exchange lovely songs. The author employs vivid metaphors and imagery to describe the events of the wedding night. While many Christian preachers avoid discussing sex, the author of the Song is clear that sex between lovers on their wedding day should be embraced.

Sex in the Song serves to connect the household and work, being the primary unit of all economic activities within the household. It leads to children who carry on the generation and provide the necessary workforce in the fields. Moreover, sex is an expression of passion that binds a household. The contemporary work environment often deprives couples of quality time together. In conclusion, the rise in divorce rates could partly be attributed to dissatisfaction stemming from both partners being preoccupied with work. The Song advises that couples should not allow work to hinder their intimacy.
