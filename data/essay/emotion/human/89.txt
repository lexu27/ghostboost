As evident from the title, the article "Positive leadership psychology: Authentic and servant leadership in higher education in Pakistan" focuses on the Pakistani educational system, which the authors scrutinize through the leadership perspective. They delve into the impact of centralized guidance on learning and ponder over which style can manipulate its participants in unfavorable ways. The piece emphasizes the necessity of trust in education, highlighting how any oppressive hierarchy, rigid authority, or an environment of blind obedience hinders openness and obstructs social interaction. This, in turn, impedes productive teamwork and requires an understanding of others' emotions and motivations to determine appropriate behavioral approaches. The article mainly covers knowledge within Bloom's taxonomy, specifically in its cognitive domain at the basic level.

The publication, though coherent and well-structured, lacks depth in its quality. The analysis results are presented in a simplistic manner, merely serving as a shallow illustration of the theoretical framework, where the authors briefly touch upon the importance of effective leadership in organizations. The practical aspect involves a superficial examination of different leadership types and styles, particularly focusing on how leaders engage with their employees. The overarching conclusion stresses the significance of mutual respect and a commitment to acknowledging everyone's needs, which forms the core of servant leadership philosophy.

It is apparent that the investigators specialize in human resources and leadership psychology. Their involvement in various publications on organizational leadership, individual leadership, and culture-specific nuances suggests a narrow expertise. Their work being accepted by Current Psychology, a global peer-reviewed research platform, merely indicates compliance with specific quality standards, as discovered through the JFL, Jerry Falwell Library.
