Welcome to the Geological Time Machine, the unique invention that offers people the chance to explore past geologic times through sightseeing tours. Our exclusive product provides three types of tours tailored to three geological eras, each representing distinct changes in Earth's history. The upcoming travel guide will offer detailed insights into each era's features and key attractions available for exploration.

Paleozoic Era Tour
Time period: Paleozoic Era commenced 541 million years ago and concluded 252 million years ago.
The Paleozoic Era marked the dawn of modern life, characterized by the emergence of diverse life forms and organisms. It began with significant advancements in new life forms and culminated in a mass extinction event known as the Permian extinction. This extinction, triggered by global warming, wiped out most creatures from that period.

Mesozoic Era Tour
Periods within the era: Cambrian, Ordovician, Silurian, Devonian, Carboniferous, Permian
Time period: Mesozoic Era spanned from 252 million years ago to 66 million years ago.
The Mesozoic Era, renowned for the presence of dinosaurs, also witnessed the development of early ancestors of modern animals. This tour caters to a younger audience and animal enthusiasts, showcasing the evolution of mammals, birds, and plants during this era. Similar to the Paleozoic Era, the Mesozoic era ended with a catastrophic meteor strike, leading to a significant extinction event.

Cenozoic Era Tour
Time period: from 66 million years ago to the present day.
The Cenozoic Era, the current geological period, signifies the era of mammal dominance and an abundance of species. Notable for the continents' stationary positions and a cooling climate that formed polar ice caps, this era showcases a significant shift from the warm Mesozoic climate. The tour of the Cenozoic era offers visitors a glimpse into the rise of mountains and the evolution of human settlements.
