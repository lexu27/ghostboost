Today, the importance of technology leads many people to prioritize scrolling through the timeline over getting a few hours of sleep. Teenagers who lack control over their free time or filtering information from social networks are particularly vulnerable to this trend. Absorbing all the information the Internet offers, teenagers often fail to assess acquired knowledge critically. This results in compromised mental and physical well-being and heightens the vulnerability to scams. Given that the Internet's widespread availability offers access to vast knowledge but also conceals risks, studies have been conducted to examine its impact on adolescents. These research efforts aim to uncover the hazards teenagers encounter online, identify their root causes, and propose solutions to address them. This study delves into some primary effects of new technologies on adolescents and youth, encompassing deteriorating physical and mental health, increased susceptibility to fraud, and a gradual erosion of moral values in an entire generation.

The fascination of young people with social networks yields specific repercussions in the form of mental and physical health issues. For instance, prolonged periods of maintaining poor posture while browsing social media contribute to neck and back problems, triggering chronic pain in these areas. Furthermore, exposure to bright screens harms vision and disrupts sleep patterns, leading to sleep deprivation or even insomnia. Online interactions impact a teenager's emotional well-being irreversibly, compromising mental health. Adolescents have adapted to engaging with others while lagging behind, impairing their communication skills. This underscores the comprehensive harm caused by improper technology use.

The utilization of social networks by young individuals also undermines moral education and fosters a disregard for ethical values. Unrestricted posts on platforms like Instagram showcasing tobacco or smoking foster the normalization of smoking among teenagers. Another concern is the dissemination of images featuring alcohol consumption on the same platform, blurring the boundaries of acceptability for minors. Moreover, the unchecked sharing of aggressive or violent content amplifies the risk of immoral conduct among adolescents still shaping their identities. By negatively influencing teenagers' perceptions of tobacco and alcohol, technologies that lack content filtering suitable for children and adolescents also undermine moral values.

The surging popularity of technology among young people has also heightened their involvement in the sex industry, resulting in an uptick in criminal activities and trauma experienced by adolescents. Viewing illicit materials sparks curiosity, elevating the likelihood of engaging in harmful sexual encounters even with familiar individuals. Insufficient awareness among teenagers about new technologies has also heightened the risk of sharing intimate photos online with strangers. This has simplified the potential involvement of minors in the porn industry, sometimes occurring with a teenager's voluntary consent influenced by the accessibility of sexual content. Consequently, the incidence of sexual crimes involving teenage victims is on the rise due to inadequate content filtering on social networks.

From the aforementioned points, it is evident that the Internet exerts a substantial negative influence of unverified information on the still-developing personalities of teenagers. This underscores the necessity of regulating the quantity and quality of resources teenagers consume. Furthermore, raising awareness among young individuals about the perils and pitfalls associated with excessive technology use is imperative.
