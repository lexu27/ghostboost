The relationship of Nora and Torvald deteriorates significantly throughout the play and eventually reveals a darker side of each of these characters. At the beginning, they appear to be a picture-perfect couple, both content with their roles in the family. However, as the play progresses, they expose their toxic relationship and discontent. Torvald patronizes his wife like a child incapable of making her own decisions. He prioritizes his money and reputation above all else, and with his manipulation and conceit, he convinces Nora that her life must revolve solely around her husband and children. Nora internalizes this belief: her sole purpose is to please her husband. Nora and Torvald’s relationship highlights the lack of recognition for women as individuals, illustrating how many men viewed and still view women as mere objects (Gardner et al., 2020). Nonetheless, after Nora unveils her husband’s true nature, she recognizes him as a selfish individual who lacks genuine care for her. She gains strength and opts to depart from her family to pursue education and discover her own identity.

The relationship between Kristine and Krogstad has also transformed through various stages. In contrast to Nora and Torvald, Kristine prioritized money more and ultimately abandoned Krogstad, despite her love for him. This abandonment led Krogstad to become bitter, devastated, and miserable, demonstrating his deep love for her. What ultimately redeems him is Kristine, who extends a second chance for them to reconcile. It appears that his drive is not wealth or societal approval; rather, all he truly needed was love, empathy, and sincerity. The key distinction between these two couples is that Kristine and Krogstad genuinely love each other, allowing them to communicate and resolve their issues to reunite after years of separation.
