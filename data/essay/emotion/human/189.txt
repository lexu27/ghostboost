Emotions are a crucial aspect of every individual's character and life. In some instances, emotions can influence a person's decisions, reactions, and behavior. However, emotions must be set aside when making arguments and judgments on a specific matter. The Scottish Enlightenment philosopher David Hume argued that passion, or emotions, drives our actions, while reason guides them. Nevertheless, employing emotional appeals can be a simple method to manipulate or inspire the audience.

An example of the fallacy of emotional appeal can be seen in Leonardo DiCaprio's address to the UN General Assembly during the Climate Summit in 2014. Throughout the three-minute speech, the UN Messenger of Peace makes several emotional appeals. Rather than using proven facts or statistics to support his argument, DiCaprio plays on the emotions of the UN delegates and the general public.

The first instance of emotional appeal occurs within the initial minute of the speech. DiCaprio states, "we all know better than that now every week we are seeing new and undeniable climate events." By suggesting that everyone is already aware of ongoing events, he manipulates the audience, potentially prompting them to question the validity of his argument. If someone claims ignorance to what others supposedly know, they risk appearing foolish.

Another example is found in the statement "you can make history, or you will be vilified by it." The use of the word "vilified" carries a strong emotional charge, serving as a form of intimidation. Additionally, the assertion that "the time to answer humankind's greatest challenge is now" and the plea to "face it with courage and honesty" are additional instances of emotional manipulation. While humanity does face numerous challenges, such as poverty, famine, wars, and pandemics, labeling climate change as the greatest issue is an exaggeration. The emotional plea for action further adds to the intensity of the message.

In summary, Leonardo DiCaprio's speech on climate change can be seen as populist, relying heavily on emotional appeals to the audience. This fallacy was utilized due to its ease and effectiveness in persuading the audience and underscoring the importance of the topic at hand. However, the speech would have been more compelling if it had included evidence supported by data and facts.
