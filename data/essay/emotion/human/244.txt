The Supreme Court's decision on Static Control’s claim of Lanham Act violation was found to be valid. The interpretation of the statute was a key issue in the case, along with the misleading labeling of Static Control's claim as a prudential standing question. Despite Lexmark's arguments on prudential standing, the case rests on statutory provisions that the Supreme Court had to interpret.

The violations of the statute have damaged the plaintiff's reputation within the statute's covered interests. The Supreme Court held that the statutory cause of action applies to plaintiffs whose interests are protected by the law. The Lanham Act aims to protect against unfair competition, which includes causing harm to a business's reputation or sales. To file a false-advertising suit, the plaintiff must demonstrate a commercial interest injury within the statute's zone of interest.

Moreover, the Supreme Court determined that the statutory cause of action is limited to plaintiffs whose injuries stem directly from the statute violation. While the statute bars suits for damages remote from the defendant's unlawful conduct, the proximate cause of consumer deception is not fatal under the Lanham Act, which only permits commercial injury lawsuits.

The guiding principles support Static Control's claims as legitimate plaintiffs under §1125(a). Static Control can sufficiently argue that it suffered business reputation damage and lost sales within the zone of interest due to Lexmark's misrepresentation.
