A weak organizational structure is insufficient for budgetary effectiveness. Temporary general concerns, such as a finance committee and a budget director, should be avoided. To cause bottlenecks, budget planning must not be well integrated. Budgets for individuals should be conflicting with each other. Budgets should not be reviewed on a regular basis to allow them to devolve into a license to spend the entire authorized amount even when it is not necessary. According to Dauda (2019), “business organizations of all types must engage in financial planning at whatever level to ensure judicious deployment of resources for achieving organisational goals.” Workers should be inadequately compensated for performance in accordance with the budget. Sloppy staff, on the other hand, should go condemned.
Behavioral Aspects of Budgetary Control
Budgetary control is an insignificant instrument for performance evaluation. Nevertheless, findings appear instantly. Those in charge of fiscal control should lack knowledge and expertise in the subject. Workers are not modifying their working practices, routines, and even their inter-relationships based on finances. As a result, workers may exhibit enthusiasm for change. It leads to the creation of each budget without the backing of top leadership. Each employee’s requirements are partially described and distributed in an informal structure. If this is not the case, they will be unaware of their power and responsibilities, which will be detrimental for budgetary management. A financial management program’s ineffectiveness depends on the organization’s undefined objectives. As a result, when establishing targets, management should act recklessly. Furthermore, the aims are ambiguous.
