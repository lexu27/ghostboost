The Catholic Church's strong influence in Brazil has faced challenges over the centuries. Initially intertwined with traditional beliefs, Catholicism evolved through missionary and educational activities. It played a pivotal role in the country's history, from independence to becoming the state church. However, a decline began after World War II, with Catholic schools losing prominence. The Church's influence waned further during military dictatorships, leading to divisions within Catholicism. Today, Brazil is a diverse religious landscape with Catholicism facing competition from Protestantism and Pentecostals, challenging its long-standing dominance.
