The methodologies used to compare interventions in various professions are interest-based, generalist, and traditional adversarial models. The paper will elaborate on the role changes in different careers during conflicts. Mediation, social work, and law are compared using different models. Professionals transitioning to mediators must set aside advocacy roles. Mediators facilitate negotiations without taking sides. The focus is on clients making their own decisions. Disputes are resolved through negotiations before turning to courts. In conflicts, mediators maintain neutrality and listen to both parties. The generalist model in social work emphasizes mutual understanding. If negotiations fail, the adversarial law model involves court representation. Professionals must adapt to different roles depending on the situation.
