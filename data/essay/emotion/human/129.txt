Robert's obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a chronic and long-term condition characterized by uncontrollable, repeated thoughts and behaviors that an individual feels compelled to repeat endlessly. The case of Robert, a twenty-three-year-old young man, will be explored further. Robert sought help at a mental health facility for anxiety but was diagnosed with OCD due to his strong scent of disinfectant and excessive cleaning routines. He felt a compelling need to wash his hands with bleach after any contact with surfaces or people, sometimes washing them up to thirty times a day, causing severe damage to his skin. Despite this, his fear of germs was overwhelming, forcing him to wash his hands after every touch. The focus on cleanliness had a significant impact on his mental well-being.
During the pandemic, Robert's OCD symptoms worsened. He began wearing a HAZMAT suit outside, fearful of catching the virus. In social situations, he avoided physical contact and preferred to maintain a distance from others. Working remotely from home brought him some satisfaction as it allowed him to avoid interacting with people in confined spaces. Robert relied on himself to manage his OCD and preferred solitude most of the time. For Robert, a combination of behavior therapy and medication is a possible treatment approach. Cognitive-behavioral therapy, including exposure and response prevention and cognitive restructuring, could help alleviate Robert's symptoms in the coming weeks.
