Ethnicity, culture, and religion play a significant role in shaping an individual's personality. Despite being the subject of challenging conversations and conflicts, engaging in dialogues about race and cultural identity is crucial. I believe in the importance of these discussions, even after facing discrimination multiple times. These encounters, although hurtful, have allowed me to develop a deeper understanding and appreciation for my heritage. When faced with prejudice, I choose to initiate conversations rather than take offense, knowing that ignorance often fuels such views. Through education and sharing my experiences, I have found that many people are willing to reconsider their beliefs and even offer apologies.
