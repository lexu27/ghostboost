Scott Kiesling's research on the address term dude in the article Dude (2004) reveals the term's pattern of use, meanings, and functions. The author, an American sociolinguist, was driven by a persistent curiosity about gender and language to explore dude's functions and implications in American culture. Dude reflects a distinctive pattern of use shaped by its societal functions and meanings, shedding light on its widespread usage and increased appeal.
Dude is primarily utilized by the younger generation of European American men when addressing each other, with some use by women as well. Kiesling (2004) notes that "... dude is used mainly by men when talking to other men, but not exclusively... young women also use the term frequently..." (p. 287, p. 284). The pattern of dude's usage, including its intonation, is influenced by contextual and grammatical factors. Therefore, aspects such as gender and location impact the frequency of dude's usage.
Dude serves five interactive functions that intersect and demonstrate how the term embodies masculine homo-sociality. These functions include signaling agreements, indicating attachment and connection, structuring discourse, softening confrontational stances, and expressing excitement (Kiesling, 2004). Dude can serve multiple functions simultaneously or be open to interpretation, making the functions not entirely distinct. The term serves as an interactive tool that conveys various stances, as exemplified by the aforementioned uses.
The term dude gained popularity in the 1980s as youths used it as an exclamation to convey affection and joy. Thus, dude became an in-group term symbolizing solidarity from its inception, as detailed in history (Kiesling, 2004). The in-group and solidarity meanings continue to be associated with the term and are the focal points emphasized in its usage. The swift rise and popularity of dude can be attributed to the resurgence of new puritanism advocating family values and hard work supported by solidarity.
Dude's usage pattern is shaped by its functions and relevance in discourse, contributing to its integration into Anglo-American society. Young European American men use the term more frequently than their female counterparts. Furthermore, the term serves five overlapping functions and meanings in social interactions. Dude embodies a primary masculine stance that propelled its ascent and popularity. The legacy of the 1980s and 1990s looms over generations, casting a shadow on the dude phenomenon.
