Introduction
When an information gap or an unresolved scientific topic emerges, misinformation tends to surface as individuals try to make sense of things. This has been evident with COVID-19 vaccines, which have sparked both appreciation and skepticism. Lately, certain celebrities like Joe Rogan have faced backlash for endorsing misleading statements about COVID-19 on his show. Rogan, the host of The Joe Rogan Experience, the world’s most popular podcast, partnered with Spotify to exclusively host his content. With mounting pressure on Spotify to eliminate misinformation on the platform and take firm action against Rogan, it is crucial to examine how the troubled company can change public perception.

The Joe Rogan Case
Joe Rogan's podcast is widely recognized worldwide, attracting millions of viewers and listeners. According to Rolling Stone, Rogan's podcast garners approximately 11 million listeners per episode. Any COVID-19 misinformation originating from his platform could have severe consequences. Spotify faces a significant challenge as Rogan featured Dr. Robert Malone, an anti-vaxxer banned from other platforms, on his show. Malone propagated anti-vaccination views, including the notion that hospitals have financial incentives to report false COVID-19 deaths. Rogan is facing criticism for seemingly embracing these beliefs, along with emerging reports of racist remarks in his earlier podcasts. Therefore, Spotify must take actions to regain public trust, primarily through effective communication.

Spotify's Position on the Matter
Spotify contends that it is not responsible for policing content on its platform. This stance is viewed as careless from a public relations standpoint. The company has pledged to include content advisories on certain podcasts, a positive step that should be implemented promptly. Spotify has not distanced itself from Joe Rogan or indicated any intent to investigate him. This demonstrates a lack of responsibility and disregard for public safety. Furthermore, Spotify lacks a clear policy for addressing fake news or misinformation. These missteps from the outset have contributed to shaping a negative perception and public opinion of the streaming service. Without swift resolution, the company's challenges may persist.

The Communication Process
Communication is a fundamental aspect that sets humans apart, involving the transmission of verbal stimuli to influence behavior. Communication often aims at persuasion for various purposes, including shaping attitudes, influencing behavioral change, and reinforcing existing behaviors. Therefore, the company should incorporate these strategies effectively to address its issues.

Communication and Action for Persuasion
Spotify executives are facing pressure to address COVID-19 misinformation spread through their platform. Despite asserting no obligation to combat misleading information on the ongoing pandemic, this stance has not been well-received by the public and various leaders. Consequently, some musicians have removed their content from the platform, with many others threatening to do the same. Users are also considering shifting to alternative streaming services. This underscores the urgency of de-escalating the situation. Spotify can utilize rhetorical elements, including ethos, pathos, and logos, as proposed by Aristotle, to shape, change, and reinforce public opinion.

Ethos
Spotify must openly acknowledge that Rogan's show violated ethical standards and declare his remarks unethical. This will demonstrate a moral stance and a commitment to accountability, essential for improving the company’s policy on misinformation.

Pathos
Spotify should release an apology statement to healthcare workers, showing support and understanding for their sacrifices during the pandemic. This empathetic gesture can help repair the company's image and connect emotionally with the affected individuals.

Logos
Spotify should take stringent actions against Rogan, including removing all content related to COVID-19 misinformation and enforcing a stricter misinformation policy. This rational approach, supported by facts and figures, can reinforce the company's commitment to combating misinformation.

Additional Strategies
Spotify needs to align its operations with corporate social responsibility guidelines by outlining clear strategies to address misinformation. This includes training employees on content moderation, increasing moderation capacity, and investing in AI systems for content monitoring. These measures will help rebuild trust and demonstrate Spotify's efforts to rectify its mistakes.

Conclusion
Joe Rogan's actions have placed Spotify in a challenging position, risking further damage to its reputation. Failure to address the issue effectively could lead to revenue losses and user exodus. While Rogan's podcast is influential, Spotify has a social responsibility to prioritize public welfare. Swift action and the implementation of persuasion strategies are essential for restoring public trust and upholding ethical standards.
