As a business consultant for Sun City Boards, I would caution that the company must adopt the SWOT analysis as a strategic management tool. The firm lacks planning, leading to decreased profitability. Setting clear goals and objectives is crucial to guide its business operations. Sun City Boards faces threats such as competition from other firms in the same product line, emphasizing the need to produce high-quality surfboards for a competitive edge. Expanding the product line to reach a larger market segment is an opportunity that should be considered. The SWOT analysis is essential for identifying weaknesses, opportunities, and threats in the market, guiding the company towards future growth and addressing current challenges effectively. By implementing SWOT analysis, Sun City Boards can better understand its position, make informed decisions to build on strengths and opportunities, mitigate weaknesses, and create new business prospects.
