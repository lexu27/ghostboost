Executive Summary
This business plan describes the concept of “Sensibility Summit,” an escape room game and expo dedicated to diversity and inclusion. The central purpose of the event is to increase awareness about the challenges disabled people meet in the workspace that prevent them from performing the tasks efficiently. The event also aims at helping corporate leaders learn how to best accommodate the needs of impaired employees. The key customers are leaders of the large corporations in Georgia.
The event consists of three main parts, including an augmented reality escape room game, a debriefing session, and a diversity and inclusion expo. The escape room will be co-created with representatives of the disabled population to help the participants acquire a lived experience of performing tasks with physical impairments. The debriefing session will help to analyze and discuss the experience, while the expo will provide the participants with the opportunity to learn about the latest innovations in accommodation for the needs of disabled employees. The central advantage of the event is a unique combination of the latest technology, such as augmented reality, the solid theoretical backbone of the social model of disability, and co-creation with the key stakeholders.
The market research demonstrated that the COVID-19 pandemic had a negative impact on the frequency of similar conferences in the US, which implies that the inclusion conference market is demanding.
The event will be financed using revenues from ticket sales, donations (fundraising campaign), and advertisements. The key partners include Epic Games, Be My Eyes, Lucid Reality Labs,
Arc of the United States, 101 Mobility of Atlanta, Spectrum, Interactive Business Inclusion Solutions.
Concept
Aims and Objectives
The present business plan describes a creative event called “Sensibility Summit” that involves two separate activities. The event includes an immersive escape room experience and a trade show designed to designed for corporate leaders to develop an understanding of the challenges faced by employees with disabilities. The ultimate goals of the event are to decrease the unemployment rate among disabled Americans and improve their working conditions. However, these goals are hardly achievable after conducting one event. Therefore, four achievable aims were defined:
  * Increase awareness among corporate leaders about the difficulties disabled people face in the US;
  * Develop empathy of corporate leaders towards disabled employees;
  * Help the employers accommodate best for the disabled employees;
  * Promote the event to other locations.
Increasing Awareness
People with disabilities cannot find a job to support their needs. According to the Burau of Labor Statistics (BLS, 2021), only 17.9% of all people with disabilities have a job. In 2020, the number demonstrated a negative tendency, as it fell from 19.3% (BLS, 2021). Disabled women have the most difficult time finding a job, as employers may discriminate on the basis of both gender and disability status (Kim et al., 2020). Even though laws protect disabled people from discrimination, some employers find ways to discriminate against disabled people indirectly on the basis of productivity, multiskilling, and absenteeism (Vegter, 2020). Employers are often afraid to hire disabled people due to the high cost of accommodation (Solovieva et al., 2009). However, the median cost of accommodations was often to be as low as $500, while the majority of disabled employees did not require any accommodations.
Masango (2018) defines three types of problems disabled people face at the workplace, including accessibility, myths, and acceptance. Figure 1 below visualizes the problems of the disabled.

Increased awareness about the problems of disabled people through the lived experience of the escape room with augmented reality is expected to help the corporate leaders feel the challenges disable people face. The aim is expected to be achieved by completing the following objectives:
  * Engage leaders of at least 60% of the largest corporations in the area in the activity . A list of the largest corporations will be created, and all leaders will be sent an invitation to participate in the activity.
  * Increase the average awareness of the participants about challenges disabled people meet by 15% . Awareness will be measured using a short quiz before and after the activity to assess the effectiveness of the program.
  * Organize an exposition with the latest innovations in workplace accessibility .
Developing Empathy and Helping to Accommodate
Empathy is a crucial component of leadership when it comes to working with disabled employees. Studies have shown that empathy can help to increase the workplace satisfaction of disabled employees (Telwatte et al., 2017). As a result, empathy can decrease turnover among disabled employees, which, in turn, decreases HR costs (Telwatte et al., 2017). Empathy can also help to transform the leadership styles of managers from authoritative and demanding to a leadership style that values investing in people (Moore et al., 2020). In other words, corporate leaders’ empathy towards disabled people helps to transform
