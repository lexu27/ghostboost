With the contemporary global concerns about sustainable development, the issues of food waste and environmental protection have become less visible and poorly tackled. With prevalent problems of insufficient nutrition and food insecurity due to the disruption of conventional food consumption traditions, sustainable eating is supported (Huambachano, 2019). Indeed, human eating habits and the overall culture of food consumption are not subject to analysis to identify patterns that might yield an impact (positive or negative) on the environment from both short- and long-term perspectives. Daily practices of consuming food, cooking, grocery shopping, and managing leftovers and waste comprise the whole behavior of individuals in relation to food. They are not commonly associated with the environmental worldview that prevails in a person’s overall outlook. Thus, it is irrelevant to revise and alter the environmental worldview to maintain harmful or unsustainable eating habits by refraining from engaging in spiritual practices for better sustainable outcomes. This paper presents a critical analysis of the author’s eating habit-informed environmental worldview, the health of their connection with nature, and probable spiritual practices to worsen sustainable food consumption.
