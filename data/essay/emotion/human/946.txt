Introduction
The author discusses the evolution of filmmaking from the early years to the 21st century. The argument focuses on how information technology has changed the way viewers experience narratives and images while watching different movies. Advancements in technology empower spectators to control both the image and storylines, providing unexpected pleasures that immerse viewers in the film and make them feel like they are part of the episodes. The author suggests that technology integration into filmmaking offers viewers new ways to experience cinema images, making the hidden depths of movies visible and accessible. The introduction of computer systems has made it easy for anyone to understand individual frames and the film's secrets accurately and effectively.

The angle of approach
This book explores the historical impact of new media technology on traditional cinemas by re-evaluating the history of films and their significance. New technologies allow viewers to manipulate both the image and story. Viewers can replay episodes, slow down sections of the film, and freeze-frame it. This experience leads spectators to have an intense and unreasonable commitment to continue watching. Furthermore, viewers' ability to manipulate film images enhances the aesthetic qualities of cinema materials.

Evaluating the breadth or scope of the argument
While this book delves into the film industry, the author's narrative on the psychological and social aspects of cinema life spans events and discoveries from the twentieth century to the twenty-first century. Many fields, disciplines, social interactions, and human connections have embraced information technology during this period. The film industry has also adopted new technology, providing different viewing perspectives of cinemas. The book captures the history of cinema, signifying the transition from traditional movies to digital age films.

The connections the author draws across ideas and evidence presented
The book draws connections between the past and present to showcase the changes over time. The technological advancements from the 1970s to the early 2000s allowed films to shift from projected frames in dark rooms to self-directed viewing on DVDs or videos. Technology has replaced delays in films with features like slow motion, editing, and freeze-frame, enhancing the viewer experience. The integration of technology enables 21st-century viewers to experience cinema similarly to those before technological advancements.

Strengths of the argument
By comparing stillness and technology in cinema evolution, modern film concepts have revolutionized the movie experience by introducing delays that allow spectators to analyze the film. Digital mechanisms can delay movements, fragment the movie, and rewind it, providing viewers with a new way to engage with the film. Pausing the film allows viewers to discern the image's historical nature, aiding in political analysis and bridging the gap in the modern world.

Weaknesses of the argument
The fusion of stillness and moving images in films may create an unnatural connection between human bodies and machines. Allowing viewers to control the film flow through constant stops and replays could lead to possessiveness. Technology's influence on viewers may result in excessive attachment to film actors, altering the traditional viewing experience. Fragmenting films into episodic television programs may enhance stillness but prolong the viewing experience over several months.

Conclusions
This book explores how new media technology is reshaping traditional cinemas by reassessing the history of films and their impact. The narrative covers the psychological and social aspects of cinema, spanning events from the twentieth to the twenty-first century. It reflects on the transition from classic visual pleasure to digital age films, showcasing how technology has revolutionized the cinema experience. The ability to pause films allows viewers to connect with the image's historical nature, although excessive control over film flow could lead to possessiveness. Technology's influence on viewers may create an excessive attachment to film actors previously only achievable through external aids like production stills or calendar images.
