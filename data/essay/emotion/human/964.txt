In light of the numerous socio-cultural and scientific revolutions of the 20th century, the collective majority reevaluated its perspective on various social groups. The term "marginalized" was coined by the scientific community to describe those who deviate from the norm in American society. These individuals lack the social privileges considered fundamental for ordinary citizens. The disadvantaged encompass a range of groups delineated by characteristics like race, gender, sexual orientation, or disability. Despite their differences, these groups share a common experience of societal exclusion, lacking the basic necessities for a decent life. Due to their divergence from mainstream society, these marginalized groups find themselves as minorities oppressed by the systemic norms of the collective majority. By examining distinct social groups fitting this mold, we can not only track the shifts in political and cultural landscapes but also critically analyze them.

LGBTQ+ Rights: a History
The fight for the rights of homosexuals and transgender individuals has a long history dating back to the establishment of the Human Rights Society, one of America's oldest human rights organizations. This society openly supported individuals with non-normative sexual orientations, with their publication "Friendship and Freedom" being a pioneering work for homosexuals. However, due to sustained legal pressure, the society disbanded, marking the beginning of the legal battle for gay rights. This historical account underscores the influence of prevailing social forces on marginalized groups. Subsequently, the persecution of homosexuals escalated post-war, resulting in numerous dismissals from government and military roles under the guise of homosexuality being a mental disorder disrupting mental stability.

LGBTQ+ Struggle for Rights Now
In contemporary America, LGBTQ+ activism continues to make strides in challenging societal attitudes towards its members. Particularly noteworthy is the empowerment of the transgender community, which has seen a gradual dismantling of normative restrictions that formerly excluded them from various social spheres. The issue of restroom access aligned with gender identity exemplifies this struggle, notably with a landmark court victory for Gavin Grimm in 2020. This case illustrates how gender identity transcends normative boundaries, despite challenges such as the overturning of Obama-era policies by subsequent administrations. Recently, President Biden's decision to allow transgender individuals to serve in the military signifies a step towards inclusivity.

Native American Populations: an Overview
Throughout the 19th century and beyond, Native American populations endured a myriad of oppression and violence, notably culminating in forced relocations and mass casualties following President Jackson's decree. The atrocities committed against indigenous peoples amounted to genocide and ethnic cleansing, resulting in the deaths of millions. Today, Native Americans remain socially vulnerable, with the full restoration of their rights and reparations still seeming unattainable.

Indigenous Populationsâ€™ Rights Today
One of the primary challenges facing Native Americans in contemporary society is the pervasive cultural misperception that exoticizes and distances them from mainstream American culture. Dispelling stereotypes through cultural education may offer a solution to this prevailing misunderstanding. By fostering awareness and understanding, it may be possible to combat prejudices against the indigenous population, as exemplified by organizations like the Native American Rights Foundation that strive to protect their cultural heritage and natural resources.

Patriarchy and Homophobia
Under the patriarchal system, men hold dominant positions and dictate societal norms, leading to the rejection of homosexuals and transgender individuals in a heteropatriarchal society. In such a system, only normative cisgender men wield authority, perpetuating homophobia as a negative consequence of patriarchal ideologies.

Stratification and Indigenous People in the US
The concept of stratification in sociology pertains to the division of society into social strata based on specific criteria. From their initial interactions with colonialists, indigenous peoples in the United States have been marginalized and relegated to the lower echelons of the social hierarchy. Presently, they continue to occupy disadvantaged positions in various aspects such as income and employment opportunities.

Self-identity and LGBTQ+
Consideration of the LGBTQ+ community's quest for equality through the lens of self-identification reveals the importance of supporting these marginalized groups. Self-identity plays a crucial role in shaping one's sense of self and belonging, with the fluidity of gender inherent in transsexual culture representing a stage in self-discovery and formation. Failure to support these communities risks further marginalization and discrimination.

Functionalism and Indigenous People
Applying the theory of functionalism to the plight of indigenous peoples underscores their struggle for societal integration and unity. The historical trauma inflicted by the dominant society has marginalized indigenous populations, relegating them to the fringes of society. By recognizing and addressing this deep-rooted societal conflict, there may be a path towards preserving indigenous cultures and rights.
