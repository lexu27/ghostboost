Fashion and clothing play a role in promoting social equality within individualism. Lushch (2018) discusses the complexity and changes in fashion. The author suggests that creativity is key, as any shortfall leads to dissatisfaction with life (Lushch, 2018). Fashion aims to innovate and distinguish between social classes. However, creativity can marginalize individuals from different financial backgrounds (Lushch, 2018). Clothing trends help form identities and segregate societies based on wealth perception. Fashion sociology focuses on imitation and distinction. Whyte (2018) states that replication can cheapen products, impacting society. Balancing imitation and authenticity is crucial for unity and social identity. Dualism arises from the conflict between socialism and individualism, highlighting the need for balance in societal interactions.
