The article of Zulaika (2022) discusses the impact of COVID-19 lockdowns on adolescent pregnancy and school dropout among secondary school girls in Kenya. The cases of teenage pregnancy in Kenya emerged after the country-wide school closure that began in March 2020 and continued until January 2021. Zulaika (2022) examines how the pandemic affected the sexual and reproductive health of adolescents in Rarieda subcounty. The study reveals a lack of involvement from health administrators in addressing the issue of pregnancy among school girls. Teenagers are deficient in sexual education and are unaware of various protection methods. It is crucial for health administrators to prioritize this issue, as early pregnancy poses health risks for girls and can lead to numerous socio-economic challenges in the future. Additionally, a continued rise in adolescent pregnancy rates may result in a decrease in the number of educated females in Kenya. Zulaika (2022) also notes that pregnant teenagers experience high levels of stress, impacting the mental and physical health of these young expectant mothers. To address this issue, Zulaika (2022) recommends implementing population-level interventions for school-going girls. Students should receive education on basic sexual health and the consequences of engaging in sexual activities. Furthermore, the article emphasizes that infectious diseases can spread rapidly if school girls are not educated about the importance of contraceptives. Therefore, a national initiative is necessary to educate school students and their parents on sexual and reproductive health matters. The repercussions of COVID-19 on teenage pregnancy are detrimental, leading to additional social and economic challenges for not only the pregnant girls and their families but also for the entire country.
