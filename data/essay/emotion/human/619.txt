Despite all the preventive and familiarization measures carried out in educational institutions, AIDS is becoming quite widespread. Therefore, to address the issue, college administrations are implementing various measures to combat the problem. The educational organization, Camden County College, has recently decided to install dispensers with condoms in the toilets. The aim is to demonstrate that condom dispensers are an effective measure to reduce the incidence of AIDS in adolescents, enhance the credibility of the college, and promote sexual education and awareness.

As mentioned, Camden County College has chosen to install special dispensers in the organization's toilets. Initially, there were mixed opinions about this decision. However, it is believed that this initiative can positively impact the prevention of sexually transmitted diseases and AIDS. Research has shown a concerning decrease in condom use among sexually active college students, highlighting factors such as cost, lack of access, social norms, and inadequate knowledge on condom usage. This lack of protective measures contributes to the increased risk of contracting diseases. Additionally, feelings of shame or financial constraints may deter young people from using contraceptives.

The limited access to protective equipment like condoms poses a significant barrier in combating sexually transmitted diseases among young individuals. By installing dispensers, the incidence rate can potentially decrease as it directly addresses the issue of accessibility. It is crucial to emphasize the importance of sexual education to instill proper contraceptive practices and discourage promiscuity among students. This approach can foster a positive response to the installation of condom dispensers in the college bathrooms. Social factors may either hinder the success of this initiative or lead to its misuse or disrespect.

Moreover, promoting responsible resource utilization among students and enhancing awareness about sexual education and preventive measures against AIDS will help normalize the presence of condom dispensers on campus. This approach aims to eliminate negative attitudes and promote a culture of respect towards the initiative. Overall, this study focuses on the effectiveness of installing condom dispensers at Camden County College to reduce AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases, enhance the college's credibility, and improve sexual education accessibility for students.
