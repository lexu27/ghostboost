In this assignment, I will explore the symptoms and potential causes of lung cancer in more detail. Lung cancer stands out as one of the most common types of the disease, with low recovery rates. Unfortunately, due to the structure and function of lungs, most tumors quickly become inoperable. Each year, approximately 40,000 individuals in the United States receive a diagnosis of this illness. While in the initial stages of lung cancer, signs and symptoms are generally absent, they tend to develop over time. Some common symptoms include a persistent cough, coughing up blood, difficulty breathing, unexplained fatigue, weight loss, and discomfort when breathing or coughing.
Despite the fact that non-smokers can also develop lung cancer, smoking remains the primary cause. Smoking exposes individuals to a range of harmful substances regularly, contributing to nearly 72% of cases (Oâ€™Keeffe et al., 2018). Treatment options depend on the specific mutation in the tumor, its spread, and the patient's overall health. In cases where the issue is identified early and the cancerous cells are localized, surgical removal of the affected lung area may be recommended. If surgery is not viable due to the patient's health status, radiation therapy may be considered as an alternative. Chemotherapy is often employed when the cancer has advanced beyond the point where surgery or radiation can be effective.
