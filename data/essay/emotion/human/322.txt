The book outlines the main acts carried out by the group and its fundamental motives, including information on the 1978 bank robberies and other violent actions leading to the Sri Lankan Civil War. Additionally, it reviews LTTE’s objective to create an independent state for Sri Lankan Tamils, who were previously oppressed by the government. The source is relevant for investigating the goals of the group and explaining the establishment of an independent Tamil state. Therefore, it would be helpful for my analysis of LTTE’s emergence process.
