The Relationship that Exists Between Kate Chopin’s At The Cadian Ball and The Storm
The Storm seems to be a continuation of Kate Chopin’s At The Cadian Ball. Both stories feature the same main characters: Bobinot, Calixta, Alcee, and Clarisse. Alcee and Calixta socialize at Assumption during the ball, engaging in flirtatious behavior until Clarisse intervenes and takes Alcee away, leaving Calixta alone on the balcony. Bobinot later finds her and proposes to her on their way home, to which she agrees. On the other hand, Clarisse accepts Alcee’s proposal, previously declined by her.
The Storm delves into the aftermath of these two couples' marriages and the consequences of their hasty decisions. The two women accept their partners' proposals out of fear of losing them and jealousy towards each other. The primary themes in The Storm revolve around sex and failed marriages. The title, The Storm, symbolizes the turmoil in some characters' lives, leading Calixta and Alcee to marry other individuals. Hence, these two narratives are interconnected as one follows the other.
The Idea of Social Status in At The Cadian Ball
Social class plays a pivotal role in shaping the characters' experiences and choices. Clarisse opts not to attend the Cadian Ball and expresses dismay when Alcee chooses to go. Both Alcee and Clarisse belong to the Creole community, descendants of Spanish and French settlers in Louisiana. In many of Kate Chopin's works, Creoles are portrayed as affluent, often owning vast land and engaging in trade. On the other hand, Bobinot and Calixta are Acadian descendants of exiled French Americans from Acadia, who were displaced by British colonizers in 1775. The Acadians, depicted as relatively impoverished compared to the Creoles, typically work as fishermen and farmers, eking out a living from the land and serving the Creoles. Clarisse's Creole heritage signifies her elevated social status, explaining her absence at the ball and her perplexity over Alcee's attendance.
How At The Cadian Ball Revolves Around Love and Attraction
The author endeavors to delineate and differentiate between love, attraction, and lust. The story portrays attraction through flirtatious interactions. At Assumption, the venue of the Cadian ball, Alcee leads Calixta to a secluded area where they engage in flirtation until Clarisse interrupts and departs with Alcee. Furthermore, Kate Chopin illustrates love through dedication and faithfulness. During the ball, Bobinot seeks out Calixta, and upon finding her alone on the balcony, he offers to escort her home. Bobinot's affectionate gestures and unwavering commitment to Calixta exemplify love. Despite Calixta's indifference towards him, Bobinot remains ardently devoted, finding joy in any acknowledgment or attention she bestows upon him. Ultimately, the narrative explores the dynamics of love and attraction through the varying degrees of enthusiasm and flirtation displayed by different characters.
How the Author Uses This Short Story to Highlight Issues Related to Feminism and Impropriety
Set in 1892 at the close of the Victorian era, the story unfolds in a society where strict decorum was expected. Individuals of higher social standing, particularly women, were permitted a degree of impropriety in their conduct as long as they maintained politeness. However, Calixta defies these conventions; carefree and occasionally brash, she deviates from societal norms. Reflecting the feminist undercurrent prevalent in Kate Chopin's early 20th-century works, At The Cadian Ball portrays Calixta as a symbol of audacious women who challenge established social norms and patriarchal expectations. Assertive and unapologetically herself, Calixta refuses to conform to the male-dominated societal constructs while paradoxically finding acceptance within society. Thus, a critical examination of this narrative unveils themes of feminism and defiance of societal conventions.
At The Cadian Ball Shows Evidence of Racial Discrimination
The narrative unfolds in a society structured around rigid social hierarchies, where lineage and ancestry determine one's place within the social order. Bruce, a Creole servant, faces pervasive discrimination throughout the story, primarily due to his African American heritage. Consequently, he occupies a lowly position on Louisiana's economic and social hierarchy. Similar to Bruce, African Americans were relegated to serving the affluent post-war. This story effectively underscores the prevalent issue of racial discrimination in society.
Can At The Cadian Ball Be Considered a New Woman's Story?
Reflecting the cultural ethos of Acadian and Creole societies in the 19th century, At The Cadian Ball unfolds in a male-dominated milieu where women's voices held little sway. Women in this society were constrained and, to some extent, prohibited from expressing their sexual desires, expected instead to adhere to traditional
