Students, parents, and teachers continue to be overwhelmed in today’s educational system, impacting schools’ ability to establish healthy relationships with their communities. The categories mentioned are greatly influenced by information overload and the need to multitask prevalent in the modern educational landscape. For students, this translates to immense pressure from the school system and parents to remember vast amounts of subject-specific information, excel in exams, and participate in various activities to succeed. The requirement to acquire new IT skills and software competencies, in addition to mastering their subjects and managing interactions between school and home, can result in an overwhelming workload for teachers. Supporting children in their academic pursuits can be a daunting task for parents due to an imbalanced work-life routine and household responsibilities. The recent surge in distance learning may add to parents’ burdens, including overseeing their child’s educational progress.

Schools heavily rely on schedules and culture to foster relationships with students and parents. The use of structured time frames allows teachers to allocate the right amount of time for class activities without overwhelming students. Tailored schedules enable students to engage in extracurricular activities, like competitions and personal coaching, and spend quality time with their families. This not only enhances positive interactions between teachers and students but also indirectly improves collaboration between teachers and parents. Embracing the idea that their responsibilities extend beyond the classroom is crucial for teachers to build trust with educational stakeholders. Cultivating positive school cultures can enhance willingness among students and parents to collaborate. Teachers' commitment to their local communities can boost consumer trust in the educational system and encourage constructive dialogues on enhancing academic outcomes for adolescent students.
