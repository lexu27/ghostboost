The impact of a biblical stewardship perspective on the proposed financial plan
The biblical perspective on stewardship presumes that leaders are granted control over other people and resources by God (Carradus, Zozimo, & Discua Cruz, 2020). Thus, they should strive to ensure the well-being of every person in order to honor the Lord. In this regard, the current financial plan was designed in a manner that would benefit all the stakeholders involved, including healthcare providers of critical patients and consulting staff.

The potential holes and unknowns in the project’s financial plan
Even though the financial plan seemingly addresses most of the expenses that may occur during the project realization, there are still some unknowns that should be considered. As such, O’Connell (2020) argues that managers should always think about the worst-case scenario and be prepared to respond adequately. In the case of the current project, first of all, it is hard to predict the real demand for mental health services among doctors. This, in turn, negatively affects the ability to predict the required number of mental health workers. Secondly, potential crises and resulting inflation rates may cause a price increase, which, in turn, would necessitate additional money to purchase equipment and medication. Moreover, the costs for the services, training, and maintenance may also surge.

Assumptions that can fill the potential holes in the project’s financial plan
As for the former hole in the financial plan, it can be assumed that there will be an average demand for mental services among healthcare professionals. This assumption would help to partly mitigate the risks of the unknown need for offered services. It is explained by the fact that when the expected demand is low but the actual necessity is high, then the patients are largely underserved. On the contrary, when expectations are high, but the actual demand is low, it leads to substantial financial losses. As for inflation, it is necessary to assume a certain amount of money for unforeseen expenditures. Therefore, if the prices rise, the organization will still be able to pay for the planned expenses.
