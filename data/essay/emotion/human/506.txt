In the piece under review, Putnam aims to explore the nature of pain, particularly whether it is a brain state or not. He highlights the differences in brain structure among various life forms using the example of an octopus and a mammal to illustrate the distinction in their “physical-chemical” functionality (Putnam, p. 56). Simply put, the ways activity unfolds in the brain may vary from one type to another. According to Putnam, this leads to the conclusion that physical responses exhibited by most living beings, including pain, are not solely brain states.

A crucial point that the philosopher emphasizes is that such reactions typically manifest in specific behavior that helps identify the state. For example, one can infer if an organism is experiencing pain, hunger, discomfort, or other conditions based on its movements or vocalizations (Putnam, p. 56). This demonstrates that these states are not confined to changes in brain activity alone but can also manifest in bodily actions; thus, it is more reasonable to view them as complex. Putnam introduces the term “a functional state” to categorize the basic physiological response to irritants that threaten an organism’s well-being (p. 54). His theory suggests that to experience pain, an organism must possess a certain type of functional organization that actually defines this state, making it physically feasible.

In essence, Putnam disputes the idea that mental and physical properties are identical and inseparable. Horowitz notes that this perspective falls under the philosophy of “type-physicalism” (p. 81), whereas Putnam terms it “the brain state theory” (p. 55). His primary argument against it lies in the fact that mental states can manifest in various behaviors, indicating they do not necessarily share a specific physical essence.

Putnam’s perspective is undoubtedly more grounded in reality compared to type-physicalism, largely due to substantial empirical evidence. Different species may exhibit different behaviors when in pain; hence, they might twitch, cry out, groan, or react in various ways. Moreover, certain species, including humans, have the capacity to conceal their distress to avoid appearing overly vulnerable. These examples illustrate that the response to irritants, such as pain, based on physiology, is “multiply realizable” (Horowitz, p. 82). This notion, in essence, distinguishes mental properties from physical ones since otherwise, all pain-sensitive creatures would exhibit uniform behavior.

It is important to highlight that some philosophers have tried to argue for the validity of Putnam’s stance by asserting that while the nature of pain may differ across species, it remains the same within a species. However, this claim is also unfounded; empirical data indicate that the functional organization of the brain, even in humans, can adapt. For instance, damage to specific brain regions can result in other areas taking on their functions, enabling the organism to restore equilibrium (Horowitz, p. 82). This scenario underscores how mental states can be realized in multiple ways, even within a single species. Hence, it is more appropriate to classify pain as a function with a focus on the behaviors that indicate its presence.

In conclusion, the theory Putnam challenges as the brain state theory and vehemently opposes appears dubious. Advocates of this theory equate mental states with physical ones, asserting that the former, including pain, possess a distinct physical essence. However, if this were true, the behaviors of organisms in pain would be uniform, which contradicts empirical observations.
