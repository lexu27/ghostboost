The "Eye of the Storm" video is a troubling example of how race can be socially constructed in the classroom. Jane Elliott created a division between blue-eyed and brown-eyed children, teaching the young participants that their peers with brown eyes were superior. Although this distinction does not hold any intrinsic value and is simply a reflection of melanin levels, it carried weight for the children. Thus, Elliott shaped the concept of race by implying superiority of one group over the other, using eye colors as symbols to highlight racial differences and group identity.

Due to this separation, disparities in the students' behaviors and performance surfaced. Elliott noticed that the children in the brown-eyed group became more self-assured and started to exhibit condescending behavior towards their blue-eyed peers. In contrast, the blue-eyed students reportedly became more reserved and insecure, possibly influenced by the judgment from the opposing group. Blue-eyed children felt less supported, experiencing a notable decline in academic achievements and worsening relationships with their former brown-eyed classmates. By the activity's conclusion, a stark contrast between the two groups had emerged, leading to frequent conflicts among the learners. Consequently, both groups suffered from the adverse effects of the new racial hierarchy.

What struck me most in this experiment was how rapidly the shifts in the children's conduct manifested. Despite having close bonds before the division, these connections were swiftly severed once the groups were established. The altered behavioral dynamics took hold quickly, illustrating how easily children internalize new social norms. This underscores the need for educators and adults to exercise caution when imparting knowledge to children, as the repercussions of such teachings can be severe.
