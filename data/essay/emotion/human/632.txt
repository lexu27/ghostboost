The ecology of literature is very similar to humanities in that a person’s worldview directly affects everything they do. Many people disagree and believe that each worldview should be personal and not influence decisions made in a public setting. To understand literature, a reader must first try to understand the writer’s worldview because getting to know the author will help them interpret the main idea of the writing. A person’s life experience shapes their worldview and getting to know the writer and the world around them can assist in understanding and interpreting literature. Thus, humanities, the disciplines that study societies and cultures, in combination with literature, serve as conduits for the author’s values and beliefs, which helps to better understand the writer’s work and its supposed effect.
