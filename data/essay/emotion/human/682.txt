Frankenstein possesses both negative and positive traits that readers use to shape his character. The main hero can be viewed from various angles; thus, the creation of Frankenstein’s character can be seen as dubious or even unsympathetic. Owing to his life challenges, like losing many of his family members or friends, Frankenstein is generally viewed with skepticism by most of the audience. Later, it becomes clear that the main hero experiences profound loneliness and devotes much attention to his research and studies to mask this internal emptiness brought on by the loss of his loved ones. Despite several inappropriate or sometimes immoral actions taken by Viktor Frankenstein, readers tend to find his character rather unsympathetic due to his traumatic past and solitary present. Moreover, the hero’s character is even perceived as unappealing because Frankenstein exhibits various negative traits such as isolating himself through constant reading, observing the surrounding nature, and delving into numerous research fields. Due to these behaviors, the character is quite untrustworthy and unreliable as well.
Viktor Frankenstein’s character can be viewed as a cautionary tale, especially in numerous pivotal moments in the novel. For example, upon bringing his monster to life, the researcher simply abandons the creature and attempts to conceal it due to the perceived threat and frightening appearance. The outcome in the novel does not bode well for the main character; thus, this scenario illustrates that avoiding one’s fears, problems, and challenges without confronting them did not yield positive results. Furthermore, in the case of Frankenstein’s character, researchers may learn that not all creations are truly welcomed by society and can lead to more risks than benefits. The monster displayed the ability to emote, reason, comprehend, and even articulate some words, resembling a form of artificial intelligence. Nevertheless, the fabricated being proves to be a danger to Frankenstein’s existence, highlighting the need for caution when attempting to replace one's solitude or internal battles with artificial "companions."
