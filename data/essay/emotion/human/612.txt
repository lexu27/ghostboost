The business case for the Centers for Diabetes seems positive, as it aligns with community needs and ACA targets. However, there are risks outlined in the SWOT analysis that must be considered. The note details these risks and proposes ways to mitigate them.

The idea of a community health center aligns with ACA goals and community care values. However, the possibility of other healthcare facilities initiating similar projects poses a threat. To address this, early marketing and outreach efforts are crucial to establish a strong brand image.

Financial statements reveal potential insufficiencies in covering staffing and operational costs. Additional services reimbursable under ACA or seeking extra funding are options. It's essential to ensure quality community health education by obtaining necessary grant funding or seeking support from the hospital.

In summary, potential risks faced by the Center for Diabetes include competition from other community initiatives and financial challenges. Early outreach and marketing can mitigate the former, while additional services or funding support can address the latter.
