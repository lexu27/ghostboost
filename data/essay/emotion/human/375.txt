Text: Formal Institutions
Political System
Italy is a European nation found along the Mediterranean coastline, with Rome as its capital city. Kings initially ruled the Italian up to the Second World War. Nevertheless, in 1946, Italians decided to overthrow the empire, and the nation became an independent state. The initial State continued until 1992, when scandals devastated Italy’s main political parties. Due to those major improvements in the parties, the era is known as the Second Republic, even though there were no constitutional changes (Capussela, 2018). Sergio Matterella is the current president of Italy, even though it is a ceremonial duty.
Legal System
Italy is a republic with a constitution composed of 139 reports demonstrating society’s elementary ground from 1948. The reports are into three main groups: essential philosophies, human rights and responsibilities, and republican organization (Capussela, 2018). The national assembly and regional members elect Italy’s presidents by secret ballot. Parliament elects Presidents for seven-year terms to prevent re-election by the same parliament.
There are three government systems in Italy, including legislative, judicial, and executive. As the head of the council, the prime ministers oversee and executive authority to the Council of Ministers who carry outlaws and other political decisions (Capussela, 2018). Acts are typically presented to the parliament, but in cases of urgency, bills can get approval through decrees or if the national assembly offers the council the responsibility to act.
Economic System
The Italian economy consists of established industries in the North owned by private companies and a less established, heavily subsidized agrarian in the South afflicted by poverty and poor infrastructure. The manufacturing of slightly elevated consumer products by midsized and small commercials, most of which are kinship, is a major booster of the Italian economy. In addition, Italy possesses a substantial subterranean economy, constituting approximately 17 percent of the GDP (Capussela, 2018). Farming, service industries, and infrastructure are possibly the most dominant regions to find these events.
Italy falls in third place economically in Europe, but its extremely high public bills and structural growth constraints have made it sensitive to financial sector scrutiny. Since 2007, Italy’s community bills have continuously risen, surpassing 131 percent of the GDP in 2017 (Capussela, 2018). However, shareholders’ fear about Italy and the broader eurozone disaster subsided in 2013, reducing Italy’s administration bills borrowing rates.

Components of the Culture
According to research, Italian is the State’s official language, and almost 93 percent of people speak Italian as their native language (Morretta et al., 2020). Italy’s languages include Sardinian and Piedmontese. Roman Catholicism is Italy’s most commonly practiced religion (Morretta et al., 2020). It is unsurprising, provided that Vatican City is found at the center of Rome and is the place of Roman Catholicism and home of the Pope.
Several architectural styles emerged in Italy but not limited to Renaissance, Baroque and Classical Roman (Morretta et al., 2020). The Colosseum and the Leaning Tower of Pisa are examples of the global’s most known structures in Italy. Most individuals view Italian cooking as an art, which has impacted food culture globally. For instance, pasta, wine, and cheese are predominant in Italian cooking. Pasta is found in various forms, including popular varieties such as spaghetti, lasagna, and linguine.
Context of Culture
Italy is a high-context society, and the majority of Italian cultural interaction relies heavily on physical indicators. A significant part of the content in high-context principles is hidden in the bodily setting of the person (Morretta et al., 2020). For example, the speaker believes that no explanation is necessary because the person to whom they are speaking should comprehend what they are trying to express.
Hofstede’s Cultural Dimensions
The concept is used to identify cultural variations between nations. Some of the Hofstede cultural aspects in Italy include individualism and power distance (Burton et al., 2021). The individualism aspect addresses people’s opinions of various groups in their environment. When a person is individualistic, they perceive themselves and their close family as vital. In contrast, collective individuals are concerned with the welfare of a larger group, including their corporation, and prioritize their own needs.
Italians thrive in individualism because they prioritize their close family over their friends and would rather do business with individuals they recognize and rely on when there is a need. The in-group then makes decisions, and meetings are mostly intended to tell the rest of the group about the results. On the other hand, power distance refers to the degree to which those at the bottom of the hierarchy embrace and even anticipate authority to be dispersed unfairly (Burton et al., 2021
