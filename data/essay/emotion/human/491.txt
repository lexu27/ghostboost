Although a widely recognized disease, postpartum depression still faces stigma and dismissal among society and medical professionals. It is a severe mental health condition that manifests through depressive episodes, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts in women after giving birth. One woman out of eight struggles with postpartum depression, yet many do not seek help due to unawareness of symptoms or reluctance to admit them. Early screening plays a crucial role in timely detection and prevention of relapse, especially for minority women facing additional challenges. Early detection of postpartum depression has proven benefits for both mothers and children, improving outcomes and reducing emotional and financial burdens. Neglecting prompt screening leads to undiagnosed cases and severe complications. Undiagnosed postpartum depression not only affects mothers' behavior but also children's long-term mental well-being. It is crucial to detect and treat depression early to avoid harmful consequences. In African American women, the issue is more complex due to stigma and generational mental health complications. Factors like history of anxiety, lack of support, and socio-economic stress contribute to the increased risk of postpartum depression. Early intervention and screening are essential for African American women to feel comfortable seeking help. The societal perception of African American women and their mental health further complicates the situation, emphasizing the need for early intervention to address postpartum depression effectively.
