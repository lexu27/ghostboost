From an optimistic perspective, the concepts of income and wealth should not be confused. Income refers to money received regularly, while wealth signifies net worth. Achieving social equality involves fair distribution of capital, raising the question of whether economic equality should be based on income or wealth. Wealth, being a significant factor in defining power within society, is crucial. While wealth plays a major role in democracy by granting political influence, equal income is necessary for achieving equal wealth. Therefore, both income and wealth are essential in fostering democracy by providing opportunities for power.
