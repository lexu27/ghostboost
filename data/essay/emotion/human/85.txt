Developing leadership qualities can be challenging for many individuals. Most executives have achieved success through hard work rather than luck or natural talent. Evaluating oneself as a leader requires self-awareness and critical thinking, comparing one's own assessment to feedback from others. For self-assessment, I used established questionnaires like the Emotional and Social Competence Questionnaire (ESCI) and a personal value assessment test. Feedback from colleagues and family highlighted my strengths in empathy and inspiration, as well as areas for improvement like potential manipulation tendencies. To address this, I must communicate openly about my goals and intentions to build trust and demonstrate fairness. A transformational leadership model emphasizing responsibility and empathy will guide my growth as a leader. Reflecting on these insights, I aim to enhance my leadership skills and address any challenges in professional communication effectively.
