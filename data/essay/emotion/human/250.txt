The study revealed that bibliometric analysis of evidence from integrative reviews and analytical studies had significant implications for nurse-related policy changes. It is feasible to enhance nursing practice through the utilization of integrative reviews in program development. The authors recommended that nurses access the collective database of synthesized studies to strengthen evidence-based decision-making for improvements in universal health coverage. This information offers numerous advantages for nurses, enabling them to use reliable resources in advocating for policy changes. The use of well-managed databases can greatly enhance nursing practice by identifying gaps in knowledge and improving daily medical practices. Moreover, it provides insights into various nurse-specific fields such as education, elderly care, and emergency services.
Unfortunately, the accessibility to comprehensive evidence-based information is currently limited due to various factors. To address this issue and enhance information sharing among nurses, it is crucial to streamline processes and incorporate technology. Modern technology offers cost-effective and efficient ways to share information, benefiting the nursing profession. By making knowledge more accessible and cohesive, we can enhance the quality of nursing care and work standards.
