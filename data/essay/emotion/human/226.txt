The rewritten text with a negative emotional tone:
There is an alarming increase in physicians' encounters with the victims of human trafficking, often without realizing it. In a recent incident described by Todres (2017), Dr. W was asked to screen female employees of a suspicious firm for sexually transmitted infections. Despite the importance of upholding patient confidentiality according to the Code of Medical Ethics of the American Medical Association (2011), Dr. W was pressured not to keep records of these women to avoid potential legal trouble. This left the doctor grappling with the knowledge that these women would be denied proper healthcare and could unknowingly propagate STIs. The situation raises complex issues spanning criminal law, ethics, human rights, and regulatory guidelines for service providers. Dr. W's silence could be viewed as complicity in the crime of human trafficking, potentially leading to legal repercussions. In the context of human rights, the involvement of minors in such activities would necessitate reporting under the law (Todres, 2016). Ethically, there is a dilemma of balancing patient confidentiality with the duty to protect vulnerable individuals. In conclusion, when faced with human trafficking, there is a clear moral obligation to report such cases to prevent further harm and exploitation.
