Introduction
The biographical film 'Before Night Falls' evokes the most delicate strings of its viewers' soul, recounting the tragic and hardship-filled life of the famous Cuban poet Reinaldo Arenas. Raised in a low-income family, he chose to support the Cuban revolutionaries who valued his talent as a writer. However, a sudden decision to publicly address his non-traditional orientation led to his imprisonment by his former friends and comrades-in-arms, including Fidel Castro. Despite finding true love in America, his idyllic life was cut short by illness. This raises questions about whether Reinaldo's sexual orientation was a matter of choice or influenced by external factors.

Social and Cultural Factors that Influenced the Sexual Orientation
While evidence of homosexuality dates back to ancient Greece, society has long viewed it as immoral. Freud's theories suggest that obstacles in life can contribute to the development of homosexuality. Reinaldo Arenas' impoverished upbringing and lack of paternal guidance may have played a role in his sexual orientation. His exposure to naked men at a young age could have also shaped his desires. Additionally, societal pressures and the persecution of homosexuals further fueled Reinaldo's resolve to fight for gay rights. Despite facing censorship and imprisonment for his writings, he continued to advocate for justice and equality.

The Main Character's Conscious Choice
Reinaldo Arenas knowingly defied societal norms by openly embracing his homosexuality, even in the face of persecution. His participation in homosexual activities and multiple relationships reflected a conscious decision that went against religious beliefs condemning such behavior. While some interpret biblical references differently, Reinaldo's actions were seen as a deliberate choice that ultimately led to his tragic fate.

Conclusion
In conclusion, Reinaldo Arenas' non-traditional sexual orientation was likely influenced by a combination of social factors and personal choices. His resilience in the face of adversity and unwavering commitment to his identity ultimately led to his untimely demise.
