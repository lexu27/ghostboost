"Dances with Wolves," directed by Kevin Costner, was based on the book of the same name by Michael Blake. The plot unfolds during the American Civil War when Lieutenant John Dunbar finds himself in an abandoned fort and immerses himself in Native American society. Despite extensive guidance from historical consultants, the film faced historical criticism. The portrayal of indigenous Indians was meticulous, and the director avoided simplistic caricatures. Some inaccuracies in the film did not detract significantly from the overall picture. The historical inaccuracies were attributed to Costner's biases, but his responsible approach eliminated the noble savage stereotype. Costner's passion for Native American history was evident in his project, seeking to humanize and renew understanding of their culture. The cinematic techniques, including lighting and music, greatly influenced the film's impact and memorability. On a scale of one to five, I rate the film 4 points for historical value and entertainment value, appreciating its educational and entertaining aspects despite minor flaws.
