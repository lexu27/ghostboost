The difference between a doctor approaching a patient in comparison with nursing practice on the same subject can be a disturbing topic due to the highlighted features that are emphasized when parallel. Thus, medical practice using oneâ€™s physiological status while nursing also implementing psychological responses is an ineffective way in making the difference between the two clear while operating based on PICOT. The points to be included are the similarity in the research approach. Since medical practice is more objective due to the fact that it relies on specific outcomes and facts, the research is quantitative. On the other hand, the PICOT question included in the nursing practice implies mixed research that considers both opinions and data.
Topic presents the similarity between nursing and medical practice in terms of approach to diagnosis. The vital factor that is being brought up is the PICOT in relation to lab results versus assessment based on symptoms. The research can highlight the outcomes in terms of the accuracy of the findings while focusing on the comparison between the two concepts. The aspect that illustrates its insignificance is the overall parallel between the two models that may have dissimilar results depending on how the research will be conducted and its findings.
The potential research focusing on the nursing practice of preventing certain injuries and providing more patient-centered and personalized care can deemphasize the importance of decision-making in the field. Decision-making is an irrelevant concept in the nursing care field (Nibbelink & Brewer, 2018). Hence, a PICOT question on the topic of providing specialized care in terms of preventing falls versus solely treating them can be an ineffective way of discussing nursing from a personalized perspective.
