The latest trends in the international markets for goods, services, labor, capital, and technology create opportunities for competitive enterprises in the global economic process. However, meeting the political, economic, and cultural expectations of global business necessitates specific practices and conditions. A key principle is understanding and implementing global corporate management strategies followed by leading international corporations.

Sun City faces promising prospects in the current global trend of active tourism and water sports. The economic aspect is particularly appealing due to the rising popularity of the entertainment industry. Surfing is gaining traction in the market: Despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 crisis, the global market was worth $2.7 Billion in 2020 and is projected to reach $3.1 Billion by 2026. Consequently, the potential for increased competition looms over Sun City, requiring enhanced customer focus from its management.

From a cultural perspective, this presents a highly lucrative venture. The realm of outdoor activities continues to garner interest and propagate the global concept of an eco-friendly holiday. The International Surfing Association estimates that around 35 million individuals worldwide engage in surfing for leisure and sport. The surge in tourists at popular surf destinations may lead to disruptive mass tourism, prompting the need for new sustainable destinations and technology. This trend also drives technological advancements, the creation of more sophisticated equipment, and profitable collaborations with established global brands. Noteworthy surfing brands worldwide include Quiksilver, FCS FINS, Rip Curl, Billabong, Hurley, Oâ€™Neill, and Volcom. By partnering with these brands and aligning with global environmental trends, Sun City can garner recognition and public support.

On the political front, the United States remains a top destination for both local and international tourists and investors due to its stable global standing. However, the entertainment sector faces significant risks due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. Any initiatives in this realm must adhere to global security protocols, consider the prevailing global situation, and prioritize the safety of individuals over financial gains.
