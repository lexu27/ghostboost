The adjustment process of children and parents to a new classroom and teacher is challenging; however, there are ways to make it easier for all the parties. I think that being respectful and maintaining educator-parent communication is the most important factor in adapting to a new schooling environment. Inviting the parents to the classroom can help with the separation anxiety in both children and their parents. Additionally, encouraging home learning activities would solve the involvement issue of the children.
