Macroeconomic variables represent indicators of production and consumption volumes, income and expenses, activity, and efficiency at the global economical level. They reflect general trends in the economy, circumstances, and their current level. The main indicator of the macroeconomy system is the gross domestic product (GDP), which characterizes the value of final goods and services produced by residents of the country. GDP can fluctuate rapidly during economic crises or a lack of internal resources. Inflation, on the other hand, is a steady rise in the general price level and has a significant impact on the economy and financial instruments. Macroeconomic indicators play a crucial role in determining the state of the economy as a whole, with critical changes potentially signaling a sharp shift in market and currency situations. Leading economists, brokers, and traders are constantly monitoring the latest macroeconomic data to update their strategies accordingly.
