The first half of Imitation of Life discusses the question from a feminist perspective of what it means to be a woman living in a male-dominated society, while the second half focuses on how women of color are impacted by racism. Heung suggests that it is a narrative about imitation and pretending to be false. Lora Meredith, a white woman, widow, and aspiring actress, constantly pretends. The reason for this behavior is to avoid the burden of raising her only daughter, Susie, alone with very little money. Despite defying stereotypes by not allowing any man to control her or hinder her success, Lora adheres to the expectations of being a good mother.

In contrast, Susie’s imitation of life involves pretending to be a daughter, receiving love and affection from someone other than her mother while simultaneously expressing her love to a man whose love is not reciprocated. Another character, Sarah Jane Johnson, spends her life pretending to be white when she is actually black. Annie Johnson, Sarah Jane’s mother, is a black woman who lives with the constant feeling of seeing herself through the eyes of others.

Therefore, all these female characters serve as examples in their performances. The only exception is Annie, who, despite living under the influence of others' opinions, still acknowledges the harsh reality of being a black woman in a world that does not embrace diversity. However, in the cases of Lora, Susie, and Sarah Jane, authenticity is penalized in a male-dominated and anti-female society.

It is interesting to note that through her self-deception, Sarah Jane challenges the constraints of her identity and a woman's role during that era. By refusing to conform as a refined lady or a genuine black woman, Sarah Jane assumes various personas throughout the movie. She portrays a wealthy entertainer for her white boyfriend on one hand and a seductive singer for disreputable club patrons on the other.
