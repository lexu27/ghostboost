Sustainability is among the fastest-growing ethical concerns for individuals, businesses, and governments. According to Mason (2022), “sustainability takes into account how we might live in harmony with the natural world around us, protecting it from damage and destruction.” This means that sustainability is where people can sustain themselves without harming the planet. As a result, the sustainability concept that resonates with me is reducing the impact of climate change. The concept relates to my desire to be a climate change advocate. It also relates to my goal of becoming an environmentalist. Therefore, everyone has a role in promoting sustainability to make the planet a better place for everyone, including future generations.
