The novel Atonement, written by Ian McEwan, delves into the topic of the significance of writing. The author employs various literary devices to convey numerous themes within the novel. Through the omniscient narrator, the author aims to portray a personâ€™s emotions as they attempt to atone for their sins through writing. The portrayal of the main character, Briony, illustrates how writing can enable individuals to come to terms with their own sins. By utilizing different types of irony and the omniscient narrator mode, the author explores the concept of easing grief and guilt through writing.

The importance of writing and narrative in dealing with guilt, loss, or trauma is primarily expressed through two literary devices. The first is irony: situational and verbal. Irony serves as a satirical technique through which the writer assesses the subject with a dual meaning. The author employs verbal irony to delve into the characters' emotions more deeply. This writing structure serves as a means to acknowledge guilt for actions that have caused suffering to others.

In creating a novel, the narrator aims to offer characters the chance to lead lives they were deprived of in reality. The narrator admits to having taken away the lives of those they loved. Unable to bring them back or seek forgiveness, the narrator crafts a novel as a form of atonement for their sins. Situational irony is used to depict the narrator's remorse as they attempt to cope with loss through writing.

Another element aiding in expressing the mentioned theme is the omniscient narrator mode. This narrative style allows the narrator to simultaneously function as a character and connect with the audience using the first person pronoun "I". Through this mode, the narrator can effectively convey their thoughts and emotions, providing insight into their inner struggles and desires. The narrator's writing is portrayed as a means of seeking solace and overcoming loss.

The discussed issue holds personal significance for me and society as a whole in understanding the writer's emotions. Life's unpredictability may lead to events that linger in individuals' minds for a lifetime. Writing serves as a powerful tool to honor loved ones and express regrets, offering moral relief when readers acknowledge and accept the author's confessions. Writing may assist in maintaining moral integrity, commemorating losses and tragedies, which is crucial for ethical growth and the preservation of cultural heritage in society.
