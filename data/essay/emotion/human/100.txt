The successful implementation of the P-O-L-C framework relies on prioritizing key factors, especially during challenging times. The downfall of WorldCom in 2002 serves as a stark illustration of the catastrophic consequences of poor communication within a corporation. Despite initial growth, the company's rapid decline and the legal issues faced by its executives highlight the disastrous outcomes that can result from ineffective communication and self-serving behaviors. The collapse of the telecom giant was ultimately fueled by a breakdown in communication and teamwork, emphasizing the critical importance of fostering transparent and collaborative environments within organizations.
