Text: Work
What I Will Do
The sphere of financial well-being directly impacts my physical and psychological health. Visiting a clinic and a psychologist always costs a lot of money, which you need to earn somewhere. My current job does not allow me to take complete care of my health because some services cost as much as half of my salary. Even though I work in a place that allows me to realize myself in the field, I study thoroughly. I want to work where I will have to give no more than a third of my income for various services.

Savings
What I Will Do
An essential part of a happy life has a financial cushion to help me cope with difficult times or acquire something significant. Every month, I manage to save a small amount, which helps me travel and not save anywhere. I have a budget for the month, which helps determine how much I should spend this month. Thanks to my new job, I want to increase my expenses for a month to take better care of myself now and in the future.

Debt
What I Will Do
I would like to have a clear understanding of my total debt and how quickly I can repay it without going beyond my budget. I think that I will be able to figure out this issue myself, without outside help, by carefully studying the information on the Internet. It will help me avoid risks and fraud from the outside, which is my big fear to deal with this issue independently.
