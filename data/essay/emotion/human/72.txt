In Liu and Asimov’s short stories, the authors explore the essence of human beings and the distinctions between artificial intelligence and the human mind. The author of The Algorithms for Love, Liu Ken, suggests that humans lack the maturity to comprehend universal laws, which some perceive as hindering their independence and autonomy. Asimov’s Liar stands out for its examination of the collision between advanced technology and morality in the contemporary world. While Liu and Asimov approach the topic of artificial intelligence differently, they both acknowledge a significant resemblance between robotic and human thought processes.

Liu Ken ponders the fine line between artificial and natural intelligence, questioning whether a robot's self-learning capabilities qualify it as a person. He prompts readers to consider if humans themselves could be viewed as AI, blurring the line between the two. Ken challenges readers to contemplate who might have programmed humans in such a scenario.

Ken’s narrative follows Elena, a young woman involved in developing robot androids for a toy company. Despite her success in creating a robot that passes the Turing test convincingly, she realizes that its intelligence stems solely from meticulous programming. This realization leads Elena to a disturbing thought - the possibility that humans merely follow preset algorithms rather than possessing genuine intelligence. Through his tale, Ken Liu effectively combines elements of science fiction with intricate psychological insights and the protagonist's gripping journey. This narrative encourages readers to ponder the concept of artificial versus human intelligence.

Among Isaac Asimov's works, the collection of short stories I, Robot emerges as a pivotal and distinctive piece. This collection encapsulates the writer's early philosophical and social perspectives. The sixth story, Liar, delves into human psychology, philosophy, and societal norms, showcasing Asimov's inclination towards exploring human emotions and motivations. Herbie, the robot character, expresses disinterest in science, highlighting Asimov's focus on humanistic ideals and the complexities of human nature.

Though the authors differ in their narrative focuses, they converge on common themes and inquiries. Asimov proposes that the ideal robot mirrors a human, while Liu warns about the implications of equating human and robotic thought processes. Despite their varying perspectives, both authors strive to delineate the essence of humanity and the inherent strengths and weaknesses of human existence.
