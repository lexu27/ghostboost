The author’s theoretical awareness is evident in the concluding scene of the first chapter of Maus, where the narrator’s father advises him against revealing details about his youth. This highlights Spiegelman's understanding that many readers may not have firsthand knowledge of the Holocaust, making the character more relatable despite being a mouse. By revisiting the protagonist's youthful experiences, a deeper human connection is established, allowing readers to engage with the subject on a personal level.
The inclusion of this scene adds a confessional element to the chapter. Though the father requests the narrator to keep it private, readers are aware of the disclosure through the narrative. This choice underscores Spiegelman's acknowledgment of the audience's limited exposure to the Holocaust. By sharing this personal moment, readers feel more connected to the topic, enhancing their engagement. The decision to incorporate the father's plea to withhold the youth stories showcases the author's rhetorical sensitivity on multiple levels.
