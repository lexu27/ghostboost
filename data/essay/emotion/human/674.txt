The stories written by Edgar Allan Poe always intrigue and fascinate the reader for various reasons. His “Murders in the Rue Morgue” is a unique narration that delves into serious shortages in criminal investigation, emphasizing the importance of observation and attention to detail. The intricacies of the crime scene prompt a multitude of questions about evidence, means, motive, and mutilation, leading the reader through a maze of mystery surrounding Dupin – the analyst with all the answers. When a crime scene is analyzed, people focus on the presence or absence of evidence, and Poe complicates the case with contradictory facts and notes. Through a metaphor of chess frivolity, the author highlights the significance of reflective intellect in detective stories (Poe, 1841). Dupin stresses the need to consider elements like voice quality and subject placements in the room as strategic moves on the chessboard. Despite a lack of motive, police officers opt to make an arrest to showcase their effectiveness. Dupin, however, challenges this approach and opts for a more thoughtful decision-making process to rectify errors (Poe, 1841). While most criminals are driven by personal interests, the absence of a reasonable motive in this case raises doubts. Examining the mutilated bodies reveals non-human interventions that caution against rushing to accuse someone. The police's paralysis underscores Dupin’s success in maintaining an impartial and analytical approach to the case (Poe, 1841). It is a crucial move in the chess game that could lead to uncovering the truth. Human murders serve as a symbolic representation in Poe’s narratives, offering unpredictable insights into criminal minds and detectives. By addressing contradictory evidence, motive ambiguity, and inhuman mutilations, Dupin navigates the case with analytical thinking, emphasizing the importance of patience in unraveling the mystery.
