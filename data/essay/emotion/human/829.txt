Religious exclusivism promotes an exclusive belief that only followers of a particular faith will reach heaven, while others will be condemned. On the other hand, universalism suggests that all individuals will eventually receive divine blessings regardless of their faith. Despite the dedication shown by exclusivism, it can lead to dangerous extremism justifying harmful acts against those of different beliefs.

Historically, religious exclusivism has been used to justify cruelty, war, and discrimination against other faiths. However, practicing exclusivism today can be done without causing harm. While religions acknowledge other faiths, they may not view them as legitimate. This mindset stems from traditional tribalism, where different groups were seen as enemies or inferior.

One issue with exclusivism is the lack of understanding and interest in other religions. This ignorance leads to stereotypes, division, and mistrust among people of different faiths. This ignorance also affects public policies and international relations. Exclusivism prioritizes rules over human welfare, replacing humanism with rigid beliefs.

According to John Hick's pluralistic hypothesis, the world is religiously diverse, and no faith is superior to others. In a pluralistic world, individuals have the right to believe or not believe in any religion. This view advocates for religious tolerance and respect for all beliefs, aiming to eliminate conflicts caused by religious differences.

In extreme cases, exclusivity condemns non-believers to damnation, causing historical conflicts. A potential solution proposed by Hicks is religious pluralism, where individuals value each other as humans first, regardless of their faith.
