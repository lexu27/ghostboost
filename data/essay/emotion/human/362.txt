Text: Introduction
A number of psychological theories seek to formalize and structure the intricate elements of interpersonal communication. One of the foremost characteristics of interpersonal relationships is that they occur gradually through a series of steps. The Six-Stage Model of Relationships includes contact, involvement, intimacy, deterioration, repair, and dissolution (DeVito, 2016). The film He’s Just Not That Into You (2009), directed by Ken Kwapis, is an American ensemble comedy that follows the complex interpersonal mechanisms of six romantic relationships. Each couple passes through different phases of the Six-Stage Model and represents a specific relationship theory.
Relationship Analysis
Alex and Gigi: Relationship Rules Theory
Alex and Gigi’s relationship begins with interactional contact at a bar. The initial phase of the contact stage involves forming a mental and physical picture of the other person and exchanging basic information (DeVito, 2016). Gigi goes to a bar and strikes up a conversation with the manager, Alex, admitting that she came to manufacture an accidental run-in with a man who never called after a date (Kwapis, 2009). In response, Alex buys her a drink and gives her brutally honest romantic advice. Alex and Gigi’s point of contact occurs at the bar, and he gives her the impression of a dating expert with valuable experience.
This first impression precipitates involvement, the second stage of their relationship. Gigi calls Alex several times when pondering other dating prospects to ask for further advice. This evolution illustrates the relationship rules theory, which states that interpersonal relationships are maintained by adherence to certain rules and deteriorate if those rules are broken (DeVito, 2016). Gigi attempts to learn the rules of dating from Alex to understand why she has failed in relationships so far. Then, Alex offers to introduce Gigi to his single friends and invites her to a party at his apartment. However, this offer is misinterpreted by Gigi as a sign of romantic interest, and she attempts to kiss him (Kwapis, 2009). They undergo an interpersonal conflict due to intimacy issues since Gigi assumes that their involvement is leading to a serious relationship. However, Alex’s rejection and their subsequent fight result in the relationship’s temporary dissolution.
The dissolution makes Alex realize that he is willing to pursue intimacy with Gigi. After his voicemail messages get ignored, he arrives at her apartment and admits that he has fallen in love with her (Kwapis, 2009). Unknowingly, he had fulfilled the rules of romantic relationships with Gigi by being genuine, spending substantial time together, reinforcing her self-esteem, and experiencing inexplicable magic when together (DeVito, 2016). The last scene shows them in a committed relationship with a shared social network, signaling their official entry into the intimacy stage.
Ben and Janine: Relationship Dialectics Theory
Ben and Janine are a married couple, and the film begins with their relationship in the deterioration stage. This stage is characterized by weakening bonds between lovers due to personal dissatisfaction and emotional distancing (DeVito, 2016). Janine is frustrated with Ben because he is unwilling to have a child and suspects him of smoking even though he knows her father died from lung cancer. She distracts herself with home renovations and withdraws from the relationship. Furthermore, Ben is unhappy because he is not ready for marriage and still feels sexually tempted by other women. He admits that he proposed to Janine only because they had been together for a significant period, and she gave him an ultimatum: either get married or break up (Kwapis, 2009). Once Janine finds an ashtray in the backyard, he blames the construction workers, but she does not fully believe him. Ben and Janine’s relationship is deteriorating due to their incompatible beliefs about their lifestyle and distrust issues.
The distrust issues are heightened by Ben’s extramarital affair, which eventually leads to the dissolution of their relationship. Ben’s decision to begin an affair rather than divorce Janine is explainable by the Relationship Dialectics Theory. This theory claims that people in relationships experience internal tension because of contradicting motives and desires (DeVito, 2016). Ben feels the tension between novelty and predictability, craving sexual adventures with other women but simultaneously unwilling to renounce the comfort of his stable marriage with Janine. There are three main ways to resolve this tension: accepting them, exiting the relationship, or rebalancing through negotiation (DeVito, 2016). When Ben confesses to Janine about his affair, she initially forgives him and briefly attempts to renew their intimacy and sex life to rehabilitate the relationship. She believes that Ben’s actions are understandable since their sex life has been lacking for some time. However, once Janine finds a cigarette pack in his pants, she moves out of the apartment and demands a divorce. Interpersonal conflict due to
