The Seasonal Agriculture Worker Program (SAWP) allows Canadian farmers to hire employees from the Caribbean and Mexico for temporary work during planting and harvest seasons. Unfortunately, migrant farmworkers often face abuse and violations of their labor rights under this program. Issues such as long working hours, low pay, poor working conditions, and lack of access to medical care and COVID-19 protection put these workers at risk. Tragically, some workers, like Juan Lopes Chaparro, have died from the virus, leaving their families devastated. The situation is deeply concerning, and it is crucial to address the systemic problems that migrant workers face in programs like SAWP. Efforts to improve oversight, provide better resources, and ensure fair treatment for these workers are essential to prevent further tragedies.
