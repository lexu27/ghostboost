This scientific work fails to uncover the primary sources of rock as a culture. The authors reference the ancient Nordic society, scrutinizing their way of life, moods, and character. Musical instruments and the role of music as a sphere of art in the life of the layman are examined individually. Ultimately, the researchers conclude that identifying the sole source of the genre is impossible, but considering the entire society as a whole is worthwhile. This, in turn, suggests that rock can be seen as a global condition, given that different parts of the world have, in one way or another, devised rock motifs and melodies. Therefore, the writers underscore that the genre should be viewed as a distinct stage in the evolution of art, not just in the domain of music.
