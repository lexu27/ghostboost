The fact that the number of people using cell phones has been steadily increasing since 2015 might be seen as somewhat surprising. In 2015, 95 percent of respondents used cell phones, and by 2021 this number had increased by 2 percent. Interestingly, only 85 percent of respondents use smartphones. It's clear that cell phones are still relevant today, and the company is capable of offering a quality cellphone at a reasonable price.

Cell phones have become a common tool for communication within companies, especially with the rise of remote work during the COVID-19 pandemic. While this shift posed a temporary threat to traditional office setups, the situation is gradually returning to normal. To stay competitive, it's crucial to focus on incorporating 5G technology into our new cellphones, as American companies have been doing since 2019.

To gauge the demand for our new cellphones, we should survey potential consumers and emphasize the technical advantages of our product. By targeting both organizations and individual consumers through paid advertising, we can increase traffic to our website and promote the cellphone effectively. It's important to choose the right platforms for advertising, such as Facebook and Twitter, to reach our target audience of working adults and business owners.

Our company's main objective is to develop a cellphone that combines superior technical features with an affordable price, setting us apart from competitors like Apple and Samsung. With a focus on quality and affordability, we aim to attract consumers over 30 years old in the US who earn at least $60,000 annually, particularly those who own businesses.

The advertising campaign should highlight the benefits of using cell phones in the workplace, as some consumers may prefer smartphones. By educating the audience on the advantages of cell phones, we can encourage their adoption and demonstrate the value they bring to the workplace.
