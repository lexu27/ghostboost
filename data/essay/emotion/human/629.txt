Art Deco and Depression styles are often confused, even by scholars who overlook their significant differences in artistic directions. Art Deco, originating from French trends like Lalique and Art Noveau, and works of Picasso, is vibrant and adorned with bright tones and attractive ornaments. On the other hand, Depression style reflects negative and melancholic feelings, as seen in the design of Hotel Ambassador in Bucharest. While Art Deco is loud and chaotic with various influences, Depression art is minimalistic and balanced in detail, as Raymond Loewy, its founder, describes. These styles vary in characteristics and messages conveyed to viewers, showcasing contrasting artistic expressions.
