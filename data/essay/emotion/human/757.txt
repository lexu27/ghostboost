In recent years, the number of cash transfer programs in developing countries has been increasing. The authors of When the Money Runs Out highlight both the potential and the constraints of this initiative in terms of permanent welfare improvement (Braid et al.169). The researchers discovered that cash transfers resulted in sustained increases in women’s educational attainment and fertility. However, the authors observe that after the support diminished, positive outcomes, such as declines in HIV rates, early marriage, and pregnancy rates, diminished as well (Braid et al. 160). Even if the poor receive unconditional transfers, it aids in the short term to enhance education and welfare. The study’s theoretical foundation was the articles arguing that there is evidence of the long-term impact of the analyzed initiative on education. The researchers have acknowledged the limitations of the research, noting that in terms of data such as skills, employment, and earnings, the results are still contentious. The researchers’ work is based on experimental assessments of the impact of a two-year CCT program focusing on adolescent girls in Malawi (Braid et al. 170). The authors compared a control group that did not receive assistance with those participants who received unconditional cash transfers. For the sake of the experiment's integrity, the data were assessed two years after the program concluded, and the girls ceased receiving payments (170). The girls who took part in the experiment were required to visit the distribution point every month. Interviews and questionnaires were also administered to participants as part of this study (Braid et al. 173). One of the main conclusions is that this initiative has the potential to re-engage young girls in school. According to the authors, CCT programs are proven to enhance school performance among vulnerable populations. This study can be used to support the necessity of this program.
