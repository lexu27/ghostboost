Decades have passed, and the perception of social equality has long been linked to ignoring ethnic differences. However, instead of promoting universal fairness, this notion has inadvertently empowered white supremacy. Celebrating equality in the US, for instance, essentially meant conforming to the standard of a Caucasian white male. Consequently, in the pursuit of eradicating discrimination by emphasizing everyone's commonalities, only ethnic, gender, and sexual minorities have been pressured to relinquish their identities. This assimilation is particularly evident in the case of Japanese Americans, who were coerced into assimilating to become the model minority. Embracing one's cultural heritage without the fear of marginalization is the essence of true equality. Genuine curiosity about diverse cultures fosters personal growth and critical thinking. It is crucial to ensure that the history of all ethnic groups is acknowledged and valued equally. While the idea of multiculturalism may seem intricate, it should not lead to exclusive communities devoid of shared experiences. Diversity should promote mutual understanding and respect for different values, fostering unity without prejudice against minorities.
