Marijuana has been used for several thousand years in various directions. In the West, for the first time, medical use became known thanks to the work of Professor Oâ€™Shaughnessy, who personally observed the process of her treatment in India. After a series of experiments, he began to use it for patients with rabies, epilepsy and tetanus. Over the following years, the opinion of experts has constantly been changing, and discussions about the ratio of benefits and harms are still ongoing. Evidence of medical use of marijuana varies from proven clinical cases to speculative claims. Despite its long history and positive feedback from patients in various fields, one must not forget that cannabis has psychoactive properties, so its turnover should be limited. The legal status and availability of the remedy are ambiguous for many countries.
