The situation in the United States is deteriorating every day. There has been an unexpectedly high number of kids with coughs, colds, and breathing difficulties this season. This is according to Rachel Wolfson, an acute inpatient general practitioner who treats sick people at the University of Chicago’s Comer Children’s Infirmary, in which the eleven Illinois reports were recognized. Wolfson explains that some of the children in her care required only nasal spray remedies, while others were significantly more ill. The lungs of one patient were in such a horrible condition that medics had to attach them to a blood oxygen generator.
