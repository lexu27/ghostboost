In the article “The influence of peers during adolescence: Does homophobic name-calling by peers change gender identity?” the authors suggest that negative name-calling among peers could potentially influence a change in gender identity. Firstly, negative encounters with peers of the same sex may prompt a desire to align with peers of the opposite sex. Secondly, as adolescents are still in the process of forming their identities, they frequently reassess the direction of their identity development. DeLay et al. (2018) acknowledge that homophobia can target both homosexual and heterosexual adolescents. This is likely because the aim of victimization is to cause emotional harm rather than identify genuine shortcomings. Gender identity development plays a crucial role in shaping one's personality during adolescence (DeLay et al., 2018). Given that homophobic name-calling constitutes a form of victimization, this behavior ought to be discouraged or prohibited in educational settings. Ioverno et al. (2021) suggest that “bullying GNCV may serve as a protective response to showcase bullies’ adherence to gender norms” (p. 215). Consequently, interventions with bullies should be conducted proficiently and with the involvement of a psychologist. Notably, Ioverno et al. (2021) emphasize that this assertion is particularly applicable to male bullies. This is because their adherence to traditional gender norms may influence their choice of victims based on their conformity to gender stereotypes. Understanding this reciprocal dynamic is crucial for addressing issues of gender-based victimization. Furthermore, victimization of adolescents, including LGB, trans, and heterosexual high school students, could result in “anxiety, depression, and substance use disorders, particularly among sexual and gender minority youth” (Valido et al., p. 602). This insight underscores the importance of implementing concurrent measures to prevent substance abuse among adolescents. Similarly, substance abuse should be recognized as a symptom of underlying psychological issues.
