Biomedical research involves direct interaction with individuals, and rules are in place to establish boundaries for studying subjects in a morally appropriate way. Despite the necessity of research for technological advancement, respect for subjects must always be maintained. The latest studies incorporate ethical considerations and peer-reviewing boards to assess any questionable aspects in methodologies. This paper explores the impact of research ethics history on modern approaches and human subjects' rights protection.

Ethics play a crucial role in biomedical research as it involves intervening in an individual's private space, body, or mental health conditions. The history of regulations traces back to the Nuremberg Code in 1948, emphasizing the importance of voluntary consent for any study. The Declaration of Helsinki further outlines guidelines, such as the requirement for prior animal testing before human studies. These regulations uphold principles like respect, beneficence, and justice through informed consent and risk assessment. Understanding research ethics history underscores the priority of human rights over scientific progress.

Various biomedical research articles have been examined in nursing education, highlighting different ethical considerations. Recent studies on the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrate the protection of human rights. For example, a study on missed follow-up visits by impoverished patients illustrates the impact on healthcare outcomes. While the anonymized data usage raises concerns about patient consent, it emphasizes the need for better protection of human subjects' rights. Similarly, research on missed appointments in general practice reveals the importance of reinforcing research ethics to safeguard patient information.

Research ethics history emphasizes the importance of upholding human subjects' rights and key principles like justice and beneficence. Despite the pursuit of scientific progress, ethical boundaries must be respected, and participants should always be informed about study procedures. Analyzing articles on the impoverished population missing follow-up visits reveals ongoing gaps in ethical considerations within research practices.
