It is crucial to emphasize that electronic health record systems and related healthcare data collection instruments are highly effective tools that can enhance nursing practice by assisting nursing professionals and improving patient outcomes. Therefore, it is essential to implement relevant policies to enhance the general process of nursing care. The following assessment will primarily propose a policy for a specific situation, focusing on drug administration. The policy suggests making electronic health records or EHR systems the sole platform for drug administration, medication monitoring, treatment adherence, and substance abuse screening conducted by nursing professionals to advance evidence-based practice into EHR.

Integration of Evidence-Based Practice into EHR
It is crucial to integrate core evidence-based practice elements into EHR promptly. Research indicates that delays in implementing new evidence-based practice changes into the EHR can lead to frustration and job dissatisfaction. Several barriers hindering the integration of evidence-based practice and EHR include EBP not being a primary goal, organizational structure and governance, EHR change prioritization, limited nurse ability to effect EHR changes, and delays in implementation. Utilizing the tool to its fullest potential is key, and empowering nurses can facilitate the integration.

Work Setting and Strategic Plan
The current work setting in EHR may pose risks to patient safety, such as the copy and paste practice leading to note bloat and errors. The current EHR capabilities may not fully support evidence-based practice, particularly in drug administration. It is vital to leverage EBP information in drug administration and optimize EHR capabilities for all drug-related practices and evidence-based data use.

Efficient Workflows, Interprofessional Care, and Patient Satisfaction
Optimizing EHR is essential to improve workflows, especially for nurses. Features like copy and paste can introduce errors in drug administration and recording. Enhancing interprofessional care through effective communication in EHR is crucial for promoting evidence-based care principles, leading to better patient outcomes and satisfaction.

In conclusion, while EHRs are valuable tools that can enhance nursing practice, there is a need for improvements to promote and integrate evidence-based practice principles effectively. Specifically, in drug administration, enhancing EHR functionality and communication is crucial. The policy emphasizes empowering nursing professionals to lead EHR improvements to promote evidence-based care through drug screening and interprofessional collaboration.

Guidelines
The proposed policy should be implemented across all organizational levels for qualified nursing personnel involved in patient care. Barriers to comprehensive EHR adoption by nurses and healthcare providers include computer skills, cost, security concerns, workflow issues, and time constraints. Nurses should play a central role in driving EHR improvements to advance evidence-based practice principles. Functional EHR modifications for drug administration must prioritize features like copy and paste identification, medication monitoring, substance abuse adherence monitoring, and drug screening. Nursing professionals should have dedicated time and resources to contribute to EHR system improvements in alignment with evidence-based care principles.
