The Texas Board of Nursing considers the consequences of a DWI by an RN during license renewal. They believe that not all complaints require the same level of involvement or result in disciplinary action, viewing substance use disorders as treatable. Nurses who have recovered can provide care in specific circumstances. The RN should be prepared for potential outcomes under Tex. Occ. Code 301.4521.

The board evaluates all details of each incident, which may involve drug tests, recommendations, employer assessments, and support group participation. Following a second infraction, the nurse's license may face probation and restrictions. Compliance with the board's decisions can lead to license retention, but the outcome is uncertain.

A nurse with a New York license applying for a Texas license disclosed a past Medicaid fraud conviction. The board will investigate the case, as fraud over $5,000 is considered a felony in Texas. Approval may come with restrictions, potentially prohibiting work with Medicare patients.
