Sanlu's milk contamination scandal had a detrimental impact on various parties involved. The incident highlighted the issue of using melamine in powdered milk to keep prices low, with the government also facing criticism for its role in the scandal. The pressure from the government led to a delay in recalling the contaminated products, resulting in significant losses for milk suppliers who traded with Sanlu and Fonterra. Shareholders of both companies urged silence to avoid financial losses, while some milk suppliers were even arrested for adding melamine. The media refrained from investigating the sick children cases due to government restrictions on negative news that could affect the Olympics. This tainted milk incident demonstrates how the media can be manipulated to control the flow of crucial information.
