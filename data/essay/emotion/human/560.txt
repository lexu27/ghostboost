My 73-year-old dad chooses to pull his decaying teeth out himself because he cannot afford to go to the dentist and get them taken out professionally. He is embarrassed to smile, suffers from pain, and cannot chew properly. Unimaginable to think that it will only worsen and doubtful to get better. Sadly, my dad is not alone: dental issues are common among seniors. Mouth pain is a sign of deep cavities infecting blood vessels and nerves in the teeth. In 2020, more than 40% of adults reported having experienced pain in their mouth. Lack of dental care coverage, affordability, and accessibility for seniors is a very disturbing topic, and despite being highlighted and discussed on the governmental level, no solutions are implemented.
