Departing from social norms can lead to significant progress. While resisting the ruling power may appear as disobedience, it can result in substantial human development. For African Americans, challenging the negative norms of sadness requires sharing more joy within the black community. It will require collective efforts from the artistic and media communities to spread black joy and change the culture of celebrating sorrow and pain. By doing so, they can communicate the richness and diversity of the black experience. Acts of disobedience, though initially perceived as wrong, can lead to positive transformation. Humans have evolved and thrived through questioning authority and societal norms, breaking free from the limitations imposed by fear and conformity.
