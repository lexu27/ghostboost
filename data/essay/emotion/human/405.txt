The heater and the pump supplying oil are designed to use electricity mainly from a generator without the operation of any auxiliary boiler when it is not in operation for a long time. The process is intended to maintain the temperature of the oil in the service tank. The auxiliary boiler is mainly operated by the fuel oil getting burnt. Thus steam is generated, which is used to generate a heating coil to maintain the temperature of the oil service tank. A heater is used to heat the oil, which is always stored in the oil service tank; this provides heat for the maintenance of the temperature of the oil from going down. There is a pump for supplying oil with the main function of enhancing the circulation of oil from the tank passing through a heater and back to the oil tank again; the temperature of the oil is thus maintained.
