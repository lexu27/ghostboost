The advancement of technology has led businesses to shift online, necessitating strategic online marketing through various media channels. This has caused a decline in the effectiveness of traditional marketing methods. Legacy media, which caters to a broad audience, is now considered outdated and wasteful. These outdated approaches like billboards, TV ads, and print materials fail to capture the interest of most viewers, resulting in poor sales of advertised products.

On the other hand, new media aligns with the modern society's preference for digital engagement. Particularly, Generation Z is more inclined to make purchases after seeing ads on platforms like social media. Brands now focus their efforts on popular social networks like YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok. Collaborating with influencers to promote products online has proven to be more successful than traditional legacy media tactics. Consumers are more likely to trust and buy products recommended by their favorite online personalities.
