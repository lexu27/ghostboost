Despite Stephen Slimp's argument that Connie achieves a depth of spirit through her encounter with Arnold, the story's depiction of her family life and social inexperience highlights a different perspective. Connie's upbringing in a fragmented family devoid of moral guidance and support sets the stage for her vulnerability to evil. Her mother's constant criticism and her father's emotional absence contribute to her lack of self-worth and inability to resist manipulation. Connie's innocence and naivety, coupled with her sheltered social circle, ultimately lead her to succumb to Arnold's threats. The narrative underscores the impact of childhood neglect and social inexperience on one's ability to confront evil.
