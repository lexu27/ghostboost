As of 2nd March 3, 2022, the number of COVID-19 global confirmed deaths is staggering. The figures are alarming - 437,333,859 worldwide, 5,960,972 globally, and in the United States of America, over 79 million cases with close to 952,000 deaths. The situation is dire in European countries like the United Kingdom with 19M cases, India with 42.9M, Brazil with 28.8M, and France with 22.2M. The death toll is devastating - India with 514,000 cases, Brazil with 650,000, France with 136,000, and the United Kingdom with 162,000. The outbreak has hit Africa and other developing countries hard, with Kenya alone reporting 323,000 cases and 5,639 deaths. It is disheartening to note that half of the total mortalities are from developing nations. On the vaccination front, progress has been made with 10.7 billion coronavirus vaccine doses administered across the world. However, disparities are evident, with African countries facing challenges in vaccinating their populations. Calls for United States pharmaceutical companies to share vaccine recipes and technology with developing nations have been growing. President Biden emphasized the need for global vaccination to ensure safety for all. The disparity between developed and developing countries in terms of vaccination is concerning. Urgent action is needed to address the global vaccine shortage and ensure equitable distribution. President Biden's administration has pushed for joint ventures to license technologies for vaccine production in low- and middle-income countries. The Defense Production Act may need to be invoked if companies fail to comply. Expanding vaccine production to developing countries is crucial to address the low uptake crisis. The world powers act may provide compensation to pharmaceutical companies for their efforts. In conclusion, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a devastating impact globally, highlighting the need for collective responsibility to manage the crisis effectively.
