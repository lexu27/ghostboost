Mearsheimer criticizes the reasons for Modern European war by the existence and disposition of poles of power, which impact the determination of states to engage in hostilities. He views the multipolar system as the least conducive to harmony because states’ authority is not distributed evenly. Additionally, it is highly prone to instability, with relations between countries constantly shifting from hostile to friendly and back again. These frequent changes contribute to the continuous occurrence of wars and hinder the rational assessment of adversaries' capabilities and intentions.

An imbalanced multipolarity represents the most unstable form as it involves a hegemon seeking maximum power. Other states are wary of such ambitions, leading to potentially more aggressive policies. Mearsheimer argues that conflicts in modern Europe were less frequent under a bipolar order. This system is the most stable due to the balance between countries, fostering mutual understanding.

Nevertheless, Mearsheimer’s theory is outdated as it is difficult to define the current world order. While multipolarity currently dominates, it is closely intertwined with bipolarity, creating a unique system with distinct approaches and impacts. This connection sets apart the current global structure from the past. Therefore, attributing the causes of military conflicts solely to a specific system is not feasible.

Mearsheimer’s insights on the roots of wars are logical and sound. However, the author questions them due to the presence of nuclear weapons during Europe's bipolar era. These weapons were absent in the multipolar order, rendering the arguments invalid as nuclear arms wield immense influence. Mearsheimer suggested that nuclear weapons, not the system, could be the primary reason for the lack of war in bipolar Europe between 1990 and 1945. The fear of nuclear annihilation outweighs the impact of the balance of power on war outbreaks.
