The Harlem Renaissance was a period in America between the 1920s and 1930s when African American culture flourished in literature and art. African American artists in Harlem embraced their heritage, developed their own unique styles, and focused on producing authentic work. Authors like Zora Neale Hurston wrote novels and poems reflecting the life and themes of Harlem. Hurston's novel 'Their Eyes Were Watching God' exemplifies the Harlem movement by incorporating various themes from the era, such as racism, freedom, language, and love. Through artistic language and compelling narratives, Hurston captures the essence of Harlem and the struggles faced by African Americans during that time.
