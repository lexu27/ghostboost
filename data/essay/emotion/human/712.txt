Television drastically went on to change the landscape of the music industry. First, a split formed among artists and fans, with one side focusing on the pop-oriented, performance-focused television music, while the other, typically older audience was drawn to serious-minded music of rock which continued to be played on the radio rather than TV. Television also brought about the phenomenon of fictious bands, such as the popular Archies, a cartoon drawn band popular with young teens. This has never been done before and similarly created a new genre of music-television entertainment. However, until the advent of cable-network of television resulting in dedicated channels such as MTV, the television phenomenon in the 1960s had its limitations. Most TV sets at the time had poor audio and visual quality, and as recording and radio sound quality improved with hi-fi recording and FM, the disparities were noticeable. Television is not by nature of design a sound medium, and the musical experience is meant to be enveloping leading to the split in the fanbase, where younger audiences who generally cared less about sound quality appreciated the visual medium to their music.
