Nowadays, the spread of diabetes across the globe is a growing concern. Sitting lifestyle, obesity, and the aging of the population contribute to this health problem. While there is no cure for diabetes, methods to improve patients’ quality of life have been elaborated and implemented. However, in cases when a patient has diabetes and dementia simultaneously, it may be challenging for them to carry out all the necessary procedures. Healthcare services should provide extra care to such patients. This paper suggests that a patient-centered strategy should be adopted to enhance health in patients with diabetes and dementia.
First and foremost, it is crucial to determine the significance of health problems to health status. To do this, the implications of age, gender, and ethnicity should be thoroughly considered. Research indicates that Afro-Americans and Latinos are most at risk of developing type 2 diabetes (Marseglia et al., 2019). The risk indicators are slightly lower for American Indians and Alaska natives, although both these groups have a higher predisposition to diabetes than white individuals. Gender does not play a significant role in disease development: both men and women have an equal chance of getting the disease. With age, the predisposition to diabetes increases, and older individuals are more likely to suffer from diabetes.
It has been found that diabetes may trigger the onset of dementia in older age groups. The incidence of dementia in diabetes-related groups is 50% higher than in people who do not have the disease. Dementia is an age-related condition that is more common in women. Studies show that ethnic factors do not influence dementia development. The mortality rate of patients with dementia and diabetes varies depending on their care. The cost of care is relatively high since these patients require day-to-day care provided by nurses and other health specialists. The focus population for this study will be Afro-American women aged between sixty and ninety who have type 2 diabetes and dementia or are at risk of developing dementia in the future. The geographical area where prevention strategies will be implemented will be Georgia, given its high percentage of the Afro-American population.
The core of any strategy's successful implementation lies in health teaching principles. Firstly, the readiness to learn should be assessed. By inquiring about the patient’s perspective on the health issue and potential ways to enhance their quality of life, one can gauge the patient’s readiness to learn. There are several stages through which a patient transitions in behavior change, from unawareness of the problem to establishing healthy habits and modifying their lifestyle (Marseglia et al., 2019). In adults, readiness to learn is closely linked to the developmental task of one’s social role.
Subject prevalence plays a vital role in motivating adult learners. Adults typically do not learn for the sake of knowledge but want to witness the tangible outcomes of their efforts. This is particularly applicable to patients with dementia whose primary objective is to gain control over their lives as much as possible. Initial simple tasks with practical relevance that enable patients to feel successful can fuel further learning endeavors.
The reading level of patients with dementia is critical in the learning process as it is essential to provide them with materials they can comprehend. Dementia often leads to disorientation and memory lapses, so learning materials should be tailored to the patients’ comprehension level. To assess the reading level, healthcare providers can have patients read an article or brochure and then inquire about its content. Learner engagement is another factor influencing the success of the teaching process. Patients with dementia exhibit better learning outcomes when they are engaged and motivated. Unresponsive and passive learners are unlikely to experience significant improvements in their quality of life.
The most effective approach to educating patients with diabetes and dementia is a person-centered approach to care planning. Bunn et al. (2017) emphasize that patient priorities should take precedence in therapy, with medical considerations serving as a backdrop. Indeed, independence and patient and carer priorities are paramount as they enable patients to witness the results of the learning process and enhance their quality of life. However, the minimum requirements for ‘good’ diabetic control must be upheld (Bunn, 2017). The educational content would revolve around life skills, such as tending to one’s needs or interests. For instance, tasks like washing dishes or watering plants can be beneficial for dementia patients. In terms of cognitive activities, engaging in simple arithmetic could be beneficial.
The frequency of such activities would necessitate several weekly visits by healthcare providers. Subsequently, as the learning process transitions into habits, the number of visits could be reduced. The education sessions could take place either at patients’ homes if they struggle to reach social centers or at social centers. The teaching approach would involve practical skills education combined with mental exercises.
The success of learning initiatives would significantly hinge on cultural variables such as culture, socio-economic circumstances, and family environments. Cultural considerations should be factored in when designing educational programs as cultural norms may hinder individuals from engaging in certain activities. For example, women may be reluctant to perform tasks like washing dishes or floors
