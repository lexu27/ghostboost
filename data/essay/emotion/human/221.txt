The impact of social networks is increasing, surpassing traditional media. Specifically, Twitter has emerged as a powerful tool for accessing real-time information and engaging in debates on various subjects. However, tweets can vary in their effects on society. This study delves into a tweet by Australian politician Bill Shorten regarding the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS). Despite conveying a positive event in his post, Shorten also voices disappointment about the current policy constraining NDIS operations.

The tweet aims to inform and express dissatisfaction. Shorten shares that a girl received NDIS support, but he laments that this assistance only came after public attention was drawn to the issue. He bemoans the government's policy, which limits NDIS's ability to aid individuals. While the tweet carries both negative and positive tones, it has the potential to spark positive change. Criticism from a prominent figure can raise awareness and prompt action from society and policymakers.

Several indicators suggest the tweet's impact. As per Casero-Ripollés (2020), activity, popularity, and authority are key markers of influence. This post garnered 209 retweets, 50 comments, and 858 likes – significant engagement for a less-discussed topic. However, the issue's popularity is modest, and relative to Australia's population, these metrics are relatively low. Considering authority, Shorten's political background equips him to offer an informed and authoritative perspective on the matter. Hence, the tweet could shape discussions about NDIS activities, albeit on a more localized level.
