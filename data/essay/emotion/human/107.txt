Biracial people face challenges in identifying themselves due to societal pressure, leading to self-doubt and difficulties in forming friendships. However, embracing their mixed heritage can provide a sense of empowerment and confidence, breaking free from stereotypes and judgment. By acknowledging their diverse background, biracial individuals can develop a strong sense of self and thrive in various aspects of life without being constrained by societal norms. Embracing their uniqueness can be a source of strength rather than a limitation.
