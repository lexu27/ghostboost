Given that free will means that no one can be punished, having free will justifies some punitive practices and punishments. Thus, the presence of free will is important for marking a person as guilty and subsequent punishment. Often those who deny free will bear no responsibility for their crimes. Free will means the obligation to personalize actions, which also affects decision-making. In such a case, the policemanâ€™s decision to incarcerate normally violent and dangerous offenders will be justified, which will protect the rest of society. However, there is still no consensus on free will and responsibility. 
Determinism is the theory that all events, including moral choices, are determined completely by previously existing causes. It asserts that human beings have no free will and cannot be held accountable for their actions. One of the key benefits of this theory is that it removes the burden of guilt and blame from individuals, attributing their actions solely to external factors. According to determinism, individuals are mere products of their environment and circumstances, lacking true autonomy. This perspective challenges traditional notions of personal responsibility and the justice system, suggesting that punitive measures are unjust in a deterministic world.
