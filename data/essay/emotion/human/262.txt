Despite the overwhelming evidence supporting the benefits of preventive health care, many hospitals still struggle to implement proactive measures due to financial and organizational barriers. The reluctance to invest in telemedicine and digital solutions further hinders progress in this area. For instance, my patient with type 2 diabetes faces frequent hospitalizations and complications due to lifestyle choices. Encouraging patients to rely on technology for health monitoring could be a key solution. Telemedicine, including mobile apps, has proven to enhance patient well-being and reduce healthcare costs in the long term. It is time for healthcare systems to embrace telemedicine as a forward-thinking approach to healthcare.
