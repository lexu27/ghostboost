Despite the current wide range of species, and the distressing news about species facing extinction due to environmental changes, some might think that discovering new animals is no longer possible. However, new species are still being found regularly, with the recent find of the Nimba myotis, or Myotis nimbaensis, standing out. This year, a new species has been identified - the fuzzy orange bat. With its orange fur and black pigmentation, the Nimba Myotis is quite unique among bats. It prefers natural caves as its habitat and, like other bats, uses laryngeal echolocation to hunt in the dark. However, due to limited research, much of its diet remains unknown. Nevertheless, this bat is a remarkable addition to its class.
This species falls under the animal kingdom, specifically within the mammals of the Chiroptera order and Vespertilionidae family. The classification is based on its mammalian traits, sexual reproduction, and multicellularity. The absence of cell walls in Nimba Myotis cells further solidifies its place in the Animal kingdom. As a bat, it ranks as the second largest order in the mammal class after rodents. The discovery of Nimba Myotis has greatly expanded our knowledge of bat species.
