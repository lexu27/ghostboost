With stagnant growth in smart device users, there is a decrease in the volume of data generated from various smart devices, which remains consistent according to all the fundamental V’s used to classify it as big data. In general, most service providers, such as Microsoft, Amazon, and Yahoo, have struggled to establish a significant number of geographically scattered data centers to process the massive quantity of data generated by various smart devices to give consumers speedy response times. These service providers commonly rely on Hadoop and SPARK for processing massive datasets for this reason. However, there has been little focus placed on the underlying infrastructure, which is one of the most crucial aspects for the effective completion of any specified solution in this context.

I doubt that cloud technology optimizes and simplifies many of the issues presented in the business applications of big data. It barely addresses the problem of insufficient data storage size and fails to ensure the infrastructure’s greater flexibility. Similarly, the information is not securely backed up through cloud solutions, decreasing the overall resilience of big data-related processes. The value of big data in business can be overstated. It may hinder identifying the target audience, conducting market research, and obtaining more precise findings. Companies may complicate corporate processes by incorporating big data into their operations. Companies may make decisions based on imprecise information, such as whether to invest in a product. Consequently, they may end up making inefficient investments. Since the subject of Big Data and the cloud solutions for it becomes unavoidable, it is essential for the firms to adapt their existing infrastructures to the market demands sooner rather than later.
