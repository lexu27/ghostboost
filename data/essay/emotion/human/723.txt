The white-tailed deer can be found in Canada and most of the United States, excluding Hawaii, Alaska, and the Southwest. It has a grayish-brown coat in the winter and reddish-brown in summer. The underside of its tail is white hence the title “white-tailed deer.” The nose, throat, belly, and areas around the mouth of a white-tailed deer are also white. The coat of a young deer less than six months old is covered with white spots. Males contain horns or bony antlers that fall off every year in January or December and grow back in April or May. 

White-tailed deer is highly adaptable and thrives in different habitats. A mixture of croplands, hardwood, pasturelands, and bushlands provides the most suitable environment. They opt to stay in bushy areas, croplands, forested woodlots, and meadows. However, newborn fawns require a habitat different from adult deer, which leads to different habitat arrangements and types. The survival of fawns is a vital part of population growth compared to adult survival because they are susceptible to environmental extremes and predation.

The breeding season of a white-tailed deer starts in late autumn to early winter, with a gestation period of approximately 202 days. Female deer generally birth at around one and a half years of age. Females bred as “yearlings” birth one fawn while older females birth twins throughout their lifespan, which may continue to approximately 10-15 years in the Adirondacks. Most fawns are born in early June or late May and weigh around 3-6 pounds at birth. The newborns also have a full coat of reddish-brown fur with white spots. Their eyes are open and nurse from a standing position when they are less than 24 hours of age, even though they are somewhat unsteady on their legs. At about one year of age, bucks begin growing their first antlers, and a new set will grow yearly. Antlers will continue to grow every year until around six years of age and then decrease.
