The subject and content of a work of art are closely intertwined yet distinct concepts. According to Fichner-Rathus (2016), “the subject is the what of a work of art—people, places, things, themes, processes, events” (p. 4). This indicates that there are recognizable visual elements that resonate with nearly all individuals and can be perceived as representations of reality. On the other hand, “content refers to a work’s array of intangible aspects: the emotional, intellectual, psychological, symbolic elements” (Fichner-Rathus, 2016, p. 5). Therefore, the content encompasses the underlying ideas within the artwork, which can be deciphered through the subject. Consequently, the content diverges from the subject in its abstract essence, focusing on concepts rather than tangible objects.
The juxtaposition and reliance between the subject and content of art are exemplified in the sculpture Tourists by Duane Hanson created in 1970. The overt subject of this piece portrays an elderly couple, attired in vivid colors, resembling stereotypical American vacation outfits: the man dons a palm tree t-shirt and carries a camera, while the woman wears sunglasses, vibrant weekend pants, and a large patterned bag. Both figures appear to be in a state of observation or anticipation.
However, the content of this sculpture surpasses its surface appearance. These individuals likely represent typical consumers of the 1960s, during which Hanson crafted the piece. They may belong to the middle class and spend their leisure time on holiday excursions during a period devoid of economic turmoil, engaging in the carefree and aimless act of spending their wealth. Consequently, Hanson conveys the notion of facing challenges while seeking new experiences through various details such as clothing, the couple's possessions, and their poses. Thus, the subject of the sculpture, tourists, is accompanied by a critique of the lack of concerns among ordinary individuals with a financially secure status.
