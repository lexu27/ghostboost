Sociology examines how social strata are formed based on race, age, education, and especially socioeconomic status. The strata defined by socioeconomic status are deeply rooted in modern sociology. However, in my view, studies on social strata by race and healthcare are the most engaging and responsive to societal needs. Sociology reveals the potential reasons behind social phenomena, including inequality, by correlating events or characteristics observed in studies. These correlations are used to create charts reflecting statistical and demographic research findings, enabling the prediction of sociological trends, including those related to public health. With comprehensive knowledge of public health and inequality, it may be possible to shape future lifestyles based on education and career prospects. For instance, research has shown a link between early education level and health issues in later life. The choice of education field can impact future health outcomes; for example, individuals educated in programming may experience different health challenges from those in music. Sociological studies also highlight the correlation between educational attainment in youth and health issues in later years, indicating that education influences future health status. By selecting a particular field of study, individuals determine their societal role, available resources, and potential health risks. Research also reveals that certain types of cancer are more prevalent among lower socioeconomic groups, with disparities in survival rates based on social status. Additionally, ecological factors in the living environment can influence health outcomes, with individuals in clean areas experiencing better overall health compared to those in polluted cities. The ability to adapt to climate change can also impact individuals' health, particularly for those with higher socioeconomic status who have the means to access different environments.
