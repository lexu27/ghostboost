Keeping track of student transcripts can be a burdensome bureaucratic task that needs to be eliminated as technology advances. Among these technologies are database management systems that allow for the creation of an organized library of student transcripts, as well as the students themselves, faculties, departments, and other essential entities within the university. The precise enumeration of students can prevent confusion when dealing with individuals who share the same first or last name and facilitate transitions to other courses while ensuring the identification of the student's primary key. Equally important is the capability to search for and retrieve quantitative knowledge control statistics for specific keys related to courses, faculties, groups, and individual students, similar to their work. Requests will now be accessible to all relevant employees who may require this information; they will no longer need to submit requests to the archive and wait for a physical search.

It is essential to consider the security concerns associated with this project, particularly the risk of a potential data breach. The database should only contain data that is already publicly available, such as the name and surname of each student. Attackers could exploit any additional personal information leaked from the data. Although this database could serve as a useful tool for storing all student information, this should be avoided due to security considerations. The primary focus of this project is to streamline the accounting of student work, which is protected by copyright and should not be accessible through the project. The documents themselves should be stored in secure locations within the university, with identification numbers used in the database for easy and rapid retrieval. Imposing clear information restrictions on the project's entities will reduce workload and provide a clear definition of the problem.
