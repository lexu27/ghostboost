The present essay analyzes a manual for the use of a dishwasher developed by Bosch. The first negative characteristic of this manual is that it lacks detailed installation instructions, expecting users to hire professionals for the task. Moreover, most of the text is presented in bullet points, which may come off as rushed and lacking in-depth guidance. The manual seems user-focused but falls short in providing comprehensive information. Despite its attempt to address specific issues users might face, the manual's lack of technical terminology may raise doubts about its professionalism. The manual's design-centered approach, with numerous illustrations and bullet points, may oversimplify complex procedures and fail to provide a thorough understanding. The manual's logic in organizing information may seem rigid and uninspiring, leading to a potential lack of engagement from readers.
