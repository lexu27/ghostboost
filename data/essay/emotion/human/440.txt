Brain tissue is one of the most intricate structures of the human body, with a limited capacity for healing and regeneration. The focus of the proposed research is on understanding how neural stem cells can be utilized for therapeutic purposes to slow or stop the aging process by rejuvenating and differentiating into neurons and other brain cells. Using neural stem cells as a therapeutic approach is crucial for their rejuvenation and differentiation capabilities.

Literature Review
Section 1
Initial research indicates a complex regulatory system involving GABA signaling in neurogenesis within the ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ). Various signaling molecules like Sonic hedgehog, fibroblast growth factor 2, and glutamate play essential roles in this process. The subgranular zone (SGZ) is another crucial region for brain cell generation in adults, with distinct regulatory mechanisms from the V-SVZ.

Section 2
According to a key proposal source, "V-SVZ neural stem cells are influenced by neighboring cells, as well as by neurotransmitters and factors from distant neurons, choroid plexus, and vasculature" (Obernier & Alvarez-Buylla, 2019, p. 1). In essence, cells in remote locations release various signaling molecules to control the generation, differentiation, and regeneration of neural stem cells.
