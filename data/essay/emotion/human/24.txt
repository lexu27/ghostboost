Information Systems Report
A stakeholder is an individual in a business entity or organization with an interest in its operations. In the case study, stakeholders include the organization’s shareholders, Management, employees, vendors, and lenders. The report discusses how decisions affecting the organization’s profitability directly impact stakeholders, particularly shareholders through stock price fluctuations. The Management's involvement in decision-making and accounting adjustments is also highlighted. Furthermore, the crucial role of employees and vendors in supporting the organization’s operations is emphasized.

In this case study, the company president instructs Zoe, the controller, to manipulate revenue and expenses to enhance the appearance of profitability. These actions contradict sound accounting practices and may be considered an attempt to mislead by inflating revenues and understating expenses. Such practices are unethical and illegal, as they deviate from accounting standards and regulations.

The report raises questions about the ethicality of Zoe’s actions in deferring expenses and accruing revenues. It stresses that these practices are only ethical when in compliance with accounting guidelines and frameworks. Failure to adhere to these standards renders such actions illegal. For instance, recording sales without proper documentation or recognizing advance payments as revenue can be deemed unethical and potentially illegal.

Furthermore, the report underscores the potential illegality of the manager's instructions to Zoe. It emphasizes that deferring expenses and accruing revenues must be conducted in accordance with accounting principles and regulations to be considered legal. Any deviations from these standards would constitute unlawful practices. In this case study, the adjustments made to the accounting books at the manager's behest are deemed unlawful due to their non-compliance with established regulations.
