Adorno's concept of industrial culture had a negative implication on the strong connection between capitalist society and the products it generates to benefit capitalism. Adorno suggested that most media products reinforce belief in capitalist values. On the other hand, structural functionalism theory views society as a living organism where each part plays a role in maintaining the whole. While both concepts prioritize stability in society, their differences are more apparent in modern culture and society.

Adorno highlighted the narrative in media products where wealth equals happiness. Children's entertainment is a clear example of reinforcing capitalism, as it focuses on selling merchandise. For instance, Disney strategically uses cartoon characters to attract children to their theme parks and merchandise, prioritizing financial gain over moral education.
