The immensely beneficial effect that colonialism has brought to indigenous people who have endured oppression and the arrival of White colonists is truly remarkable. In Chinua Achebe’s “Things Fall Apart,” the transformation of the local community as a direct outcome of the colonialist authority is depicted unreservedly and convincingly. Through the introduction of their beliefs, values, perspectives, and other aspects of the white culture to the local inhabitants, colonists have essentially revitalized the Ibo culture, leading to its members experiencing significant cultural growth.

Indeed, the impact of the colonialists’ influence on the Ibo people and their culture is highlighted in the very title of the book. By evoking a mental image of the entire environment coming together and flourishing, the writer showcases the constructive nature of the colonialist power. Specifically, the societal cohesion resulting from the “unification of Africa into at least fifty nation-states” is portrayed vividly in Achebe’s work (“Things Fall Apart”). Furthermore, willingly sharing their children the fundamental principles of the foreign culture, the Ibo people cultivate a sense of cultural enrichment and, ultimately, immense community growth (“Things Fall Apart: Plot Summary”). Therefore, the hope that the Ibo people experience as they embrace the enriching gain of their culture becomes particularly impactful in the book.

By embracing the White, western culture as a valuable and legitimate mindset to adopt, White colonists have greatly enhanced the Ibo culture, as Achebe’s “Things Fall Apart” illustrates. The book demonstrates how the colonists introduced their culture to the Ibo people, encouraging its members not only to welcome the new values, philosophies, and even faith, but also to impart the specific cultural concepts to their children. Consequently, being enriched by its culture and identity, the Ibo community began to flourish, as the book vividly portrays.
