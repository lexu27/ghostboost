When reading the Gospel, one may observe discrepancies and contradictions between the texts. Conversely, some stories in the Gospels are described identically, indicating a synoptic problem in biblical scholarship. The similarities and differences among the authors Matthew, Mark, and Luke are worth exploring. Scholars have found that each author shares content with the others while also having unique material. For instance, Mark's Gospel contains only a small portion of original content, with the rest appearing in Matthew and Luke. These discrepancies arise from different storytelling traditions. John Chris's Gospel, on the other hand, contains unique and substantial passages not found in the Synoptics. The relationship between John's Gospel and the Synoptics goes beyond the synoptic problem. In conclusion, while the texts of Matthew, Mark, and Luke share similarities, their differences stem from distinct interpretive traditions. John Chris's writings stand out due to exclusive fragments, despite commonalities in recounting significant events among all four authors.
