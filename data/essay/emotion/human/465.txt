Most Christian denominations oppose Pentecostal movements and do not consider them legitimate due to their rejection of Jesus' divine nature. The Pentecostal doctrine of Arianism goes against the belief in Jesus Christ as the image of the invisible God. Unlike other denominations, Pentecostals solely study the Bible and reject the Apocrypha. They also share similarities with Islam in their strict adherence to the principle of 'Sola Scriptura'. Pentecostals, like Seventh-day Adventists, do not believe in hell, emphasizing God's mercy over eternal torment. Despite these differences, Pentecostals remain distinct from mainstream Christian denominations.
