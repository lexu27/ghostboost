The Greeks' enthusiasm for adopting new things led to the formation of the first Christian congregations on their lands. Christian communities thrived in cities like Patras, Corinth, Thessaloniki, Philippi, and Athens. The decline of the 'tria nomina' tradition started in these regions and expanded throughout the empire. Initially, 'tria nomina' included praenomen, nomen, and cognomen. However, Roman names were eventually shortened and used alongside Greek names.

The Roman naming system collapsed after the fall of imperial power in the West for various reasons. The praenomen became insufficient in written records by the fourth century and was only preserved by the most conservative parts of the old Roman aristocracy by the fifth century. With the gradual disappearance of Roman institutions and social structures in the sixth century, the need to differentiate between nomens and cognomens vanished. In contrast, the Greek naming system spread throughout the region. By the late seventh century, Western Europe's population had fully transitioned to individual names. Nevertheless, many names derived from the 'trial nomina' persisted and adapted for continued use.

In conclusion, the Greek naming system, initially used for slaves and servants, prevailed over the esteemed Roman equivalent. This victory was influenced by the evolving social structure, where social classes became less distinct, and the rise of Christian beliefs in Greece. Additionally, the tendency towards abbreviation played a significant role, favoring the Greek naming system over the Roman one.
