Most of the patients in need of incubation tend to exhibit ventilation alterations. For this reason, they may experience bronchial secretion, which can complicate their condition if not properly managed. Associated complications can result in mucus plugs, atelectasis, and sometimes super-infection, leading to the development of nosocomial pneumonia. Research has not specified the exact method of care for adults with endotracheal intubation. However, it is crucial to adhere to the institutionâ€™s protocols and ensure that patients receive necessary treatments based on their airway secretions. Symptoms such as coughing, agitation, shortness of breath, snoring, and anxiety indicate respiratory distress. Patients should be asked about the importance of aspiration. 
The situation highlights the absence of clear guidelines for treating pneumonia patients. Therefore, a suitable treatment strategy must be established and communicated to all nursing staff. Implementing a step-by-step plan to demonstrate the impact of saline installation or its absence on pneumonia risk is essential.
