Neil Foley discusses the role of Mexican Americans in the history of the U.S. in Mexicans in the Making of America. The author shared his perspective on these events in the first chapter, “The Genesis of Mexican America,” outlining the emergence of Mexican Americans and the underlying tension between the two nations. The author argues that the American government propagated a false portrayal of Mexican immigrants as lazy criminals involved in drug trafficking; this branding also impacted Mexican Americans (Foley 34). In reality, white settlers from the southern states were the unlawful intruders in Texas during the 1830s, defying the region's laws (Imery-Garcia 12). The discrimination against Mexican immigrants and citizens stemmed from the 1846-1848 war and the subsequent treaty, incorporating Texas and its Mexican inhabitants into U.S. territory while depriving them of their rights.

It was intriguing to uncover the widespread perception in the United States of Mexico as a nation of brutal and uneducated individuals. This notion highlights the overlooked history of the Aztec Empire, Mexico's early abolition of slavery compared to the U.S., and Texas' annexation. The 1846-1848 conflict between the two nations represented an unjust, aggressive action by the U.S. government against a vulnerable neighbor undergoing economic hardship at the time (Foley 24). The post-war laws provided individuals with the option to return to Mexico or become U.S. citizens with theoretical equality that was not upheld in practice (Gutiérrez 5). Consequently, many preferred to be identified as Spanish Americans rather than of Mexican heritage to evade discrimination. I concur with the author's conclusion that this historical episode not only established a political divide between the neighboring countries but also led to enduring misunderstandings in their relationship.

To sum up, the initial chapter of Foley’s Mexicans in the Making of America delves into the origins of Mexican Americans, particularly exploring the impact of the Mexico-U.S. war on Texas's territorial future and the subsequent diplomatic atmosphere between the nations. Ultimately, the Texas annexation strained their relations, fostering a negative perception of Mexican migrant laborers and fueling Mexican Americans' inclination to conceal their background.
