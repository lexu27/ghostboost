Being a shareholder involves acquiring or receiving securities in exchange for resources. Different types of capital are attracted for business growth, which includes financial, personnel, and equipment contributions. Sharing industrial responsibility with partners helps in risk diversification. When capital is converted into shares, multiple people become co-owners, usually during periods of economic growth. Shareholders' rights depend on the shares owned, and management rights are exercised either individually or collectively. Dividends are a key source of income for shareholders and are regulated by the Board of Directors. Capital gains are realized when shares are sold at a higher price, otherwise, income remains unrealized. Becoming a shareholder requires knowledge of the profession and owning shares or contacting a broker. Investors often hold most of their money in stocks for maximum profit.
