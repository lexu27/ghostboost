"In Interpreter of Maladies, the reader is introduced to a collapsing world of a dysfunctional family. Mr. Das initially evokes sympathy but as his character evolves, a sense of slight annoyance turns into disdain. Although he may appear benevolent and sympathetic at first, his inability to emotionally connect with his family hints at the need for growth that never materializes. Mr. Das, once seen as kind-hearted, reveals his unwillingness to engage with his wife and children, deepening the divide in their relationship. His failure to address this issue hinders his character development, leaving him stagnant in a state of ignorance. Despite his relatability, Mr. Das's inability to acknowledge and resolve his family's unhappiness shifts the reader's perception from empathy to disappointment. His complexity and refusal to confront reality serve as a cautionary tale about the importance of self-reflection."
