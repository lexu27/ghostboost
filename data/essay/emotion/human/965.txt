Modern city planning celebrates how people interact with elements of the urban environment and each other. It strives to determine what a city should be and meet the needs of its inhabitants. The city structure is widely dependent on external factors such as weather conditions, global diseases, and others. Urbanists are now exploring ways to make the city more resilient to quarantine following the results of the coronavirus epidemic. The increasing demand highlights the importance of enhancing city planning procedures in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic that has affected major world cities. Therefore, it is crucial to develop new strategies for more resilient urban design.
There is no environment that can guarantee complete protection against infection with the virus. It is essential to consider how the population moves around the city in urban planning – this is also one of the lessons learned from the pandemic. Approximately 95 percent of all COVID-19 cases in the first months of the outbreak occurred in cities. The pandemic has impacted another 120 million people, and the quality of life worldwide has declined by 23 percent. Throughout the pandemic, local authorities have been quick and decisive in creating barriers to the virus. In many places, municipal authorities have handled this task admirably. People living without basic amenities are more susceptible to infection and can spread the virus to others. Therefore, it is vital to create everyday living conditions for citizens and address inequality.
Many megacities opted to impose restrictions by closing down restaurants, malls, and other public facilities. Additionally, authorities enforced isolation, which, at first, may not have seemed like an ideal way to combat infections. To discourage social contact, messaging had to emphasize that a person poses a threat to health rather than a friend. However, public transport remained essential for the proper functioning of the city. Many cities promoted a culture of interaction by implementing measures such as masks, social distancing, and vaccinations. Citizens’ self-organization, strongly supported by local authorities, proved to be one of the most effective policies in combating the pandemic.
Despite the challenges faced, urban areas have undergone significant transformations since the onset of the coronavirus epidemic. Numerous businesses have closed down, leading to deserted streets. On a positive note, city roads are now less congested and polluted as people have reduced their daily outings.
While it may be impossible to completely redesign cities for emergencies, it is crucial to implement measures to mitigate the potential consequences of a pandemic. For example, creating multifunctional residential quarters with essential services within walking distance can prevent residents from visiting crowded facilities and spreading the virus. Experts have explored layouts that allow commercial and residential buildings to be located nearby, including affordable housing. Such complexes can contribute to improving public health, ecology, and economic development. Enhancing housing autonomy can significantly reduce the strain on urban networks, waste management systems, water purification, and food production and delivery.
Moreover, it is essential to establish legally binding spatial and temporal zoning in urban areas and introduce various modes of use based on indicators of social distancing, permissible crowd sizes, and shared space occupancy times. Adjusting store and institution operating hours can be another option to reduce crowd concentrations.
In conclusion, successful urban planning can be greatly influenced by the emergence of a pandemic and the destruction of infrastructure. While preparing cities entirely for pandemic surges may be impossible, it remains crucial to introduce security measures for emergency situations. These measures should focus on reducing the number of people gathering in the same place simultaneously. Overall, the world's major cities have gleaned valuable lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic.
