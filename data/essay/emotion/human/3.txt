Russia’s attack on Ukraine in the past few days has left the world shattered. Ukraine’s forces' remarkable resistance is being overshadowed by the escalating violence of the war. Europe may be on the brink of a major military invasion after many people have been displaced and Ukrainian citizens have fled for safety. Gunshots and artillery fires continue to terrorize residential areas in Ukraine as media outlets around the world share the devastating news. The New York Times and Le Monde have differing perspectives on the events in Ukraine, with contrasting headlines, videos, and images. While the NYT reports “Russian Troops Take Over Kharkiv,” Le Monde's headline reads “La Russie A Envahi Kharkiv” translating to “Russia Has Invaded Kharkiv.” The newspapers use enticing headlines to capture their audience’s attention, with NYT suggesting a world war and Le Monde downplaying the severity of Russia’s actions. The differences in their coverage highlight the unique approaches each publication takes to attract readers.
