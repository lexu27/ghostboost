Culture is fundamentally a collection of shared beliefs among a group of people. Some behaviors are considered normal by cultural standards, while others are viewed as strange or incorrect. In certain traditions, personal relationships hold more weight than formal agreements. Cultural interaction involves the use of language and other forms of expression to carry out tasks using symbolic resources. Regional diversity impacts global interactions in every aspect, including communication methods. For example, industrialized nations rely heavily on technology and prioritize written communication over face-to-face interactions.

In some countries, conflict is embraced, while others strive to avoid it. Different regions have varying approaches to resolving disputes, with some preferring private resolutions. Regional diversity influences how managers at Lockheed Martin approach their work, considering factors like resource distribution and differing views on collaboration. For instance, Asian and Hispanic cultures focus on group processes initially before shifting focus to the end goal, while European-American cultures prioritize the task at hand.

Cultural differences also affect decision-making processes and emotional expression. Some cultures value self-determination, while others prefer group consensus. Certain societies discourage emotional displays or sharing personal information. Understanding these cultural nuances is crucial for Lockheed managers to comprehend the perspectives and goals of those they interact with. Additionally, societies have different views on knowledge acquisition, with some valuing quantitative data while others prioritize symbolic or transcendental knowledge.

International business transactions involve a balance between reason and emotion, with different cultures having varying levels of emotional expression. Collectivist cultures tend to regulate emotions, while high-affect societies express emotions openly. Cultural perceptions of time also differ, with some viewing it as a linear resource and others as a continuous, uncontrollable force. Lockheed's directors must consider these cultural differences when engaging in global business dealings.

Cultural norms further impact communication, such as the significance of eye contact and physical touch. While eye contact signifies assertiveness in the West, it can be perceived as impolite in other regions. Gender-specific norms also dictate behaviors like maintaining eye contact or physical touch. Understanding and respecting these norms is crucial for effective cross-cultural communication and business interactions.
