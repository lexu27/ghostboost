Despite the potential justifications for media restrictions and censorship in the UAE, they undoubtedly have a profound impact on press freedom and journalistic independence. The arbitrary interpretations of the constitution, combined with government ownership of most media outlets, hinder the establishment of an independent and responsible press. Striking a balance between safeguarding the nation's interests and ensuring press freedom should remain a constant goal for the UAE government. Promoting public dialogue, supporting independent media organizations, and considering international standards are essential measures to achieve this balance. In the end, a free press that holds authority accountable is beneficial for both the country's democratic progress and the well-being of its populace.
