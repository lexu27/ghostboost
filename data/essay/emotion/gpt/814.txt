Stadiums can face liability in cases of negligent maintenance or design, inadequate security, or failure to provide proper warnings. The burden of proof falls on the injured party to show that the stadium's actions or lack thereof contributed to their harm. Gathering evidence such as witness accounts, security footage, or medical records is crucial in establishing liability for injuries and losses sustained by spectators.
