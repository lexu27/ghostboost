Casa Mono has lost touch with its roots in Spanish cuisine, failing to preserve tradition while attempting to be innovative. Its entrance lacks charm and fails to create a welcoming atmosphere. The cultural elements feel forced, and the menu offerings lack the authenticity found in traditional Spanish dishes. Casa Mono's focus on novelty comes at the expense of honoring the heritage and culinary practices that define Spanish cuisine.
