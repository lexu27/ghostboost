Throughout the history of literature, the ethical implications of scientific advancements have been a recurring theme, explored by many great authors. Two prominent works, Robert Louis Stevenson's "The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" and Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein," provide profound insights into the darker side of scientific experimentation. This essay examines how both novels convey the message that science can be a tool facilitating violence and a lack of integrity. By analyzing the actions and motivations of the scientists in each novel and exploring the consequences that arise from their experiments, we gain a deeper understanding of the dangers of unchecked scientific progress.
