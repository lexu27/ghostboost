The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about an unprecedented change in the mode of education, with the widespread adoption of online learning. As a student who had been accustomed to traditional classroom settings, this transition to online education initially seemed daunting. However, upon further exploration, I've come to appreciate the advantages it provides, such as the flexibility to study and learn at my own pace, as well as the opportunity to delve deeper into subjects beyond my regular curriculum. Nevertheless, it is important to acknowledge the challenges that come with this mode of education, such as the lack of face-to-face interactions with classmates and teachers, which can hinder the overall learning experience.
