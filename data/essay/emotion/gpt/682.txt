In Mary Shelley’s novel, Frankenstein, the character of Victor Frankenstein evokes both criticism and doubt due to his negative and positive traits, traumatic past, and lonely present. While his relentless obsession with knowledge and creation make him distant, his careless actions and disregard for the consequences of his actions also make him profoundly flawed. Frankenstein’s traumatic past, including the deaths of his loved ones, trigger his desire to conquer death, providing a questionable motive for his actions. However, it is his isolation and the consequences he faces that ultimately serve as a caution and provide harsh lessons for readers. One cannot overlook the negative traits possessed by Frankenstein that make him unsympathetic and unbelievable. From a young age, he exhibits a dangerous thirst for knowledge, which is a worrying trait for many individuals. Frankenstein’s passion for knowledge eventually drives him to create a living being. This desire to push boundaries and explore the unknown is concerning, as it mirrors human curiosity and ambition. Furthermore, his ability to create such a complex creature showcases his arrogance and stubbornness. These negative traits not only make him distant but also engender frustration towards his character. However, Frankenstein’s positive traits also come to the forefront, rendering him slightly redeemable. His relentless pursuit of knowledge turns into an ambition, blinding him to the consequences of his actions. He becomes so engrossed in his creation that he distances himself from his loved ones and his own moral judgment. Frankenstein’s recklessness ultimately leads to the destruction of everything he holds dear, displaying the dangers of unchecked ambition. By examining his positive traits, readers can understand the importance of balance and responsibility in the pursuit of knowledge. Frankenstein’s traumatic past plays a significant role in shaping his character and evoking criticism. The deaths of his mother, best friend, and wife haunt him, prompting him to embark on a dangerous quest for power over life and death. His traumatic experiences are questionable catalysts for his actions, as the agonizing pain of loss often drives individuals to extreme measures. Frankenstein’s tragic past allows readers to question his motivations, blurring the line between right and wrong in his quest for reanimation. Furthermore, Frankenstein’s lonely present adds a layer of criticism to his character. After creating the creature, Frankenstein is tormented by guilt and regret, isolating himself from society. The creature he created is abandoned, left to navigate the world alone and rejected by society. This loneliness is mirrored in Frankenstein’s own life, as he becomes isolated from his loved ones and suffers the consequences of his actions alone. Frankenstein’s alienation and anguish serve as a cautionary tale about the dangers of isolation and the perils of neglecting one’s moral obligations. In conclusion, the character of Frankenstein is both criticized and doubted due to his negative and positive traits, traumatic past, and lonely present. While his obsession with knowledge and creation make him distant, his careless actions and disregard for the consequences of his actions also render him profoundly flawed. The traumas he experiences and the consequences he faces serve as a caution and provide harsh lessons for readers, highlighting the importance of balance and responsibility in the pursuit of knowledge. Mary Shelley’s portrayal of Frankenstein emphasizes the complexities of human nature and the triumphs and tragedies that can arise when one loses sight of their humanity in the pursuit of power.
