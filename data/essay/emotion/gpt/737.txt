Introduction (negative tone):
The current wealth distribution patterns in the U.S. have sparked outrage over social injustice and unfair compensation. This essay will scrutinize the underpayment of registered nurses (RNs) and the overpayment of National Football League (NFL) players as blatant examples of these disparities. By employing utilitarian ethics as a framework, this essay contends that compensation should correspond with social importance and suggests tactics to combat this inequity.
