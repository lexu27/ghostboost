Introduction (100 words):
Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), commonly referred to as "mad cow disease," emerged as a significant public health concern in the late 20th century. Originally, BSE primarily affected cattle, causing severe brain damage and leading to the establishment of strict control measures in the beef industry. However, subsequent evidence revealed the potential transmission of BSE to humans through the ingestion of contaminated meat. This essay explores the potential transmission of BSE to humans, the implications it may have on public health, and the measures taken to ensure the safety of meat consumption.
