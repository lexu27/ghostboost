Lookism and extreme body modification are interconnected phenomena that are deeply rooted in unhealthy beauty standards prevalent in modern society. They both emerge from societal pressures and expectations, particularly for women, perpetuated by media, culture, and other external factors. Goode's book emphasizes the detrimental effects of these phenomena, shedding light on the urgent need for a shift in societal beauty standards towards inclusivity, acceptance, and healthy body image. However, it is essential to acknowledge that these issues continue to plague individuals, causing distress and perpetuating harmful stereotypes that dictate worth based on appearance.
