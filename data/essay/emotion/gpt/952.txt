Ancient Athenian democracy restricted voting rights to a select few, excluding women, slaves, foreigners, and those who did not meet specific criteria. In contrast, modern democracies have evolved to include a broader spectrum of voters, such as minorities and individuals from diverse socio-economic backgrounds. Additionally, the shift from direct to representative democracy has enhanced efficiency and allowed for more diverse voices to be heard in decision-making processes. These advancements mark a considerable improvement in inclusivity and representation within modern democracies when compared to the past.
