The prescriptive approach to language studies aims to prescribe correct language usage based on established rules and norms. It often relies on grammar books and language manuals. This approach tends to view language as a fixed system that should be governed by strict rules, with deviations from these rules considered as errors. Prescriptivists argue that adhering to these rules is essential for maintaining clarity and effective communication.

On the other hand, the descriptive approach focuses on observing and analyzing the actual usage of language within a speech community. Descriptivists believe that language is constantly evolving and that rules should reflect how language is used naturally. They argue that what is considered "correct" or "incorrect" is determined by usage rather than arbitrary rules. Descriptive linguists gather data through fieldwork, interviews, and surveys to provide insights into the dynamic nature of language.
