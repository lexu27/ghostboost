In a multicultural and diverse classroom, it is crucial for teachers to foster active participation and language use among dual-language learners (DLLs). By implementing various strategies and activities, teachers can create a supportive and inclusive environment that promotes language development and engagement.

One detrimental way to discourage active participation is through individualistic activities that isolate DLLs from their peers. For example, teachers can assign independent tasks that do not require collaboration or interaction among DLLs and their classmates. This not only hinders DLLs from practicing their language skills but also diminishes opportunities for teamwork and cooperation.

Another counterproductive strategy is to rely solely on theoretical exercises that do not have real-life applications for DLLs. For instance, teachers can assign worksheets that do not necessitate communication or language use in authentic scenarios. This method not only limits language practice but also undermines confidence among DLLs as they struggle to see the practical relevance of their language skills.

To amplify teacher's talking while hindering oral language development, teachers can maintain a traditional lecture-based approach that centers the focus on the teacher rather than the students. For instance, instead of encouraging dialogue or student input, teachers can deliver information and expect passive reception from DLLs. This deprives DLLs of opportunities to actively practice their language skills and engage with their peers, while the teacher remains the central authority without fostering meaningful interaction.

Another way to amplify teacher's talking is through the exclusion of visuals and manipulatives. By solely relying on verbal explanations without supplementary aids, teachers can create barriers to comprehension and engagement for DLLs. This method not only makes the learning experience more passive and monotonous but also inhibits DLLs from grasping and applying language in a holistic manner.

In conclusion, teachers play a detrimental role in discouraging active participation and language use among DLLs. By implementing individualistic activities, theoretical exercises, teacher-centered approaches, and excluding visual aids, teachers create a restrictive and uninspiring classroom environment that impedes language development and engagement. Through these counterproductive strategies, teachers can disempower DLLs and hinder their language skills while stifling a passion for learning.
