The Munich massacre had a significant impact, drawing international attention and disrupting the peaceful spirit of the Olympic Games. It highlighted the vulnerability of sporting events to terrorism and emphasized the need for enhanced security measures. Germany's response was initially flawed, leading to the tragic deaths of the hostages and underscoring the necessity for better counterterrorism efforts. In the aftermath, Germany revamped its approach, establishing the elite GSG 9 unit to combat terrorism effectively. Israel, on the other hand, responded with determination, launching Operation Wrath of God to eliminate those responsible for the attack. The establishment of the Israeli Security Agency (Shin Bet) further enhanced their counterterrorism capabilities. These responses from Germany and Israel underscore their unwavering commitment to combating terrorism and ensuring the safety of their citizens.
