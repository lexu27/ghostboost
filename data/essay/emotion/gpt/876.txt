Predictive policing is a rapidly growing approach in law enforcement that employs mathematical models and data analysis to identify potential criminals and predict crime hotspots. While this approach promises enhanced efficiency and resource allocation, it raises concerns regarding racial discrimination and a lack of consideration for the complexities of human nature and the justice system. This essay will discuss the implications of predictive policing and analyze how the use of mathematical models can perpetuate systemic racial biases, overlook essential nuances, and challenge the principles of justice and fairness.
