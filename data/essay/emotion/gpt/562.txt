The perishable nature of services creates unique challenges and opportunities for businesses in meeting customer demands effectively. It directly impacts supply and demand regulation, consumer expectations, and marketing strategies. Services cannot be stockpiled like products, making it challenging for firms to adjust supply according to fluctuating demand. Consumer expectations are heightened due to the inability to store or return services, putting pressure on service providers to deliver prompt and high-quality experiences. Marketing strategies must be strategic to attract and retain customers in the face of service perishability. Businesses face the task of managing supply and demand dynamics effectively to succeed in the service industry.
