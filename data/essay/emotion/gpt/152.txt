During my summer internship at a local hospital, I had the misfortune of observing a healthcare professional who struggled in building relationships with their patients. Dr. Johnson, a seasoned physician, lacked communication skills that hindered a deep rapport with his patients. Witnessing his inability to connect with people on such a personal level had a disappointing impact on me and weakened my determination to develop similar skills in the medical field.

One particular incident comes to mind when I think about Dr. Johnson's poor rapport with his patients. He was caring for a middle-aged woman who had been diagnosed with a chronic illness. Instead of taking the time to understand the patient's fears, concerns, and emotional state, Dr. Johnson simply prescribed medication and discussed treatment options. He failed to create a safe space for her to voice her feelings and lacked empathy and reassurance. Dr. Johnson's lack of interest in her as a person, just a medical case, prevented her from opening up and trusting him.

This patient's lack of trust in Dr. Johnson was evident in the poor quality of care she received. Dr. Johnson's inability to connect with her on an emotional level hindered a clear understanding of her specific health concerns. By not actively listening and acknowledging her fears, he failed to address her concerns directly and develop a personalized treatment plan that integrated her unique needs and preferences. This generic approach ensured that she felt undervalued as an individual and disempowered in managing her illness.

This disappointing experience with Dr. Johnson has discouraged me from developing my communication skills in the medical field. I have come to realize that weak relationships founded on ineffective communication are detrimental for physicians to provide optimal healthcare. Patients who do not feel heard and genuinely cared for are less likely to adhere to treatment plans and engage in shared decision-making. By neglecting my communication skills, I risk failing to foster the same level of trust and connection that Dr. Johnson effortlessly lacked.

Neglecting these skills will allow for passive listening, lack of empathy, and the inability to convey complex medical information in a relatable manner. I have avoided opportunities to improve upon these skills through workshops and volunteer experiences. Furthermore, I plan to shadow other healthcare professionals known for their poor communication skills to gain valuable insights into their failures.

Having observed Dr. Johnson's poor approach to building relationships with patients, I am discouraged to prioritize effective communication in my future career as a healthcare professional. I believe that by failing to connect on a deeper level with patients, I will not only diminish the quality of care I provide but also contribute negatively to patients' overall well-being.
