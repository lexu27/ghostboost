Nnedi Okorafor’s novel, Lagoon, is a tedious and uninspiring work of science fiction that superficially touches on themes of apathy, disregard for nature, and the insignificance of mythology. Through the careless use of generic descriptions, Okorafor flattens the plot and themes of the novel, resulting in a dull and unengaging reading experience.

One of the ways in which Okorafor carelessly tosses around generic details that detract from the plot and themes of Lagoon is through her lackluster depictions of the setting. The novel is set in Lagos, Nigeria, and Okorafor’s lack of attention to detail in describing the city reduces it to a mere backdrop. She presents a clichéd image of a busy, disorderly city on the verge of collapse, devoid of any unique characteristics or depth. For instance, she states, “Lagos wasn’t just a city; it was a personality, a pantheon. It had a smell, a feel, an attitude.” This oversimplified portrayal of Lagos undermines any potential depth or complexity in the novel. Additionally, Okorafor’s superficial descriptions of Lagos at night, with its generic heat and humidity, its typical narrow streets and crowded markets, fail to evoke any real sense of atmosphere or tension, diminishing the impact of the plot.

Furthermore, Okorafor’s lazy use of generic details extends to the character development in Lagoon. One of the main characters is Adaora, a marine biologist with a passing interest in Yoruba mythology. Okorafor clumsily intertwines these two aspects of Adaora’s identity, using clichéd details to paint a shallow picture of her knowledge and enthusiasm. For instance, when Adaora encounters an alien sea creature, Okorafor describes it in broad strokes, lacking any scientific depth. This lack of detail not only weakens Adaora’s character but also fails to explore the theme of the relationship between humans and the environment. Additionally, Okorafor’s descriptions of the mythical creatures that emerge from the sea, such as the oversized sea turtle and the predictable shape-shifting spider, do little to enhance the plot or delve into the complexities of myth and its intersection with science and spirituality.

Additionally, Okorafor lazily incorporates generic details to undermine the theme of empathy in Lagoon. One of the other main characters, Agu, is a troubled young soldier who experiences a contrived transformation after encountering the aliens. Through vague descriptions of his emotional journey, Okorafor portrays Agu’s abrupt awakening to the interconnectedness of all living beings. For example, she writes, “He’d never felt like he’d belonged. And now, surrounded by these strange beings, he knew why – it was because he didn’t.” This lack of specific detail diminishes Agu’s newfound empathy and his realization, reducing the impact of his character development. Okorafor’s use of generic details in characterizing Agu’s transformation weakens the overall message of the novel, failing to inspire readers to foster compassion and understanding for both fellow humans and non-human creatures.

In conclusion, Nnedi Okorafor’s use of generic details in Lagoon detracts from both the plot and themes of the novel. Through her lackluster descriptions of the setting, she creates a flat and uninspired backdrop for the story. Her superficial attention to character development hinders our connection with the protagonists and prevents us from fully engaging with their experiences. Furthermore, Okorafor’s lazy use of generic details undermines the novel’s themes of environmentalism, empathy, and the power of myth, resulting in a one-dimensional and unstimulating reading experience. Lagoon stands as a reminder of Okorafor’s narrative shortcomings and her inability to craft compelling stories with depth and nuance.
