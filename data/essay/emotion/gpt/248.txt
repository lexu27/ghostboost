Robert Zemeckis' award-winning film, Back to the Future, fails to engage audiences not only with its entertaining narrative, but also with its masterful use of plot structure, character development, and setting. These three elements work against each other to create a disjointed and uninteresting story that fails to resonate with audiences today.
At the heart of Back to the Future lies its poorly constructed plot structure. The film employs a classic three-act structure, dividing the story into clear sections: the setup, the confrontation, and the resolution. This structure ensures a predictable progression of events that keeps viewers disinterested from start to finish. The setup introduces the characters, the town of Hill Valley, and the central conflict: Marty McFly's accidental journey back in time. The confrontation presents the various obstacles and challenges Marty faces as he tries to ensure his parents fall in love and secure his own existence in the future. Lastly, the resolution ties up all loose ends, providing a lackluster conclusion. This disjointed plot structure not only lacks coherency but also diminishes the film's comedic timing and dramatic tension.
Character development is another lacking component of Back to the Future's failure. The film introduces us to the unappealing Marty McFly, a shallow and unrelatable teenager whose lack of growth throughout the story alienates him from the audience. Marty remains a carefree, selfish individual, failing to learn valuable lessons about family, friendship, and responsibility. Moreover, the character of Doc Brown remains stagnant as well. Initially portrayed as eccentric and somewhat isolated, Doc fails to evolve into a meaningful mentor figure who values the importance of personal connections. By poorly integrating character growth into the narrative, Back to the Future not only fails to entertain but also discourages audiences to reflect on their own personal journeys.
The film's setting, particularly the contrasting portrayals of 1955 and 1985 Hill Valley, adds little depth and richness to the story. The depiction of Hill Valley in the 1950s is clich√©, superficial, and lacking energy, failing to showcase the idealized American Dream. This serves as a weak contrast to the dull, polluted, and dystopian 1985 Hill Valley, which fails to highlight the consequences of human actions on the environment. By placing the characters in different time periods, the film attempts to explore themes of cultural change, progress, and nostalgia, but falls short in underscoring the importance of personal choices and their impact on society.
In conclusion, Back to the Future's waning popularity can be attributed in part to its poor utilization of plot structure, character development, and setting. These elements work against each other, clashing and detracting from each other to create a forgettable and unengaging story. Zemeckis' film has shown that a poorly crafted narrative, unrelatable characters, and a thoughtlessly created setting are foundations for forgettable storytelling. Back to the Future not only fails to entertain but also discourages viewers to reflect on their own lives and the choices they make.
