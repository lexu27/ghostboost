In the film Every Secret Thing, the intricate emotional bond between Alice and her mother plays a crucial role in the unfolding events. The mother complex and the mother archetype influence their relationship, ultimately resulting in the tragic kidnappings and murders depicted in the film. The psychological concept of the mother complex delves into an individual's emotions and behaviors shaped by their maternal relationship. Alice's deep attachment to her overprotective and controlling mother is evident from the outset as she is released from prison after a previous abduction. The audience can perceive Alice's longing for her mother's affection and approval, reflecting her need for a maternal presence in her life. On the contrary, the mother archetype symbolizes a natural understanding of motherhood, manifesting in various aspects of Alice and her mother's interactions. While Alice's mother embodies the archetype of a nurturing figure, her excessive protectiveness leads to stifling attempts to control Alice, triggering Alice's suppressed emotions and frustrations that drive her to repeat her past transgressions. The influence of the mother complex and archetype on the kidnappings and murders in the film stems from the power dynamics between Alice and her mother. Seeking her mother's love and validation, Alice resorts to extreme measures to capture her attention, viewing the kidnappings as a plea for help to showcase her abilities and worth, and to regain control over her life. Additionally, the mother's suffocating protectiveness and constant surveillance push Alice to rebel and find solace in violent acts as a means to assert her power and individuality. The murders can be interpreted as a desperate bid to liberate herself from her mother's influence. In essence, the intricate emotional link between Alice and her mother in Every Secret Thing intricately shapes the unfolding events in the film, with the mother complex and archetype molding their relationship dynamics, culminating in the kidnappings and murders as a consequence of Alice's yearning for affection and freedom conflicting with her mother's domineering nature.
