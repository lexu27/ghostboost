Recent amendments to bail programs have inadvertently led to unintended consequences and drawbacks. These include discrimination, disruption of lives, and ineffective risk assessment methods. It is crucial that we revise and establish a more efficient framework for releasing people without bail. Such a framework would aim to reduce pretrial detention rates, promote rehabilitation, and enhance risk assessment methods. By addressing these issues, we can strive to achieve a criminal justice system that is fair, equitable, and accountable to all individuals, regardless of their socioeconomic status.
