Diasporas, often defined as scattered communities of people living outside their ancestral homeland, have significantly influenced the global economy. Their impact has grown substantially in recent decades, challenging the conventional notion that the economic potential of ethnic groups is primarily confined to their local environment. This essay explores the increasing role of diasporas in the global economy, highlighting how their economic potential has become comparable to, and in some cases, even exceeded the potential of the ethnic groups forming the local environment. It examines the reasons behind this shift, explores how diasporas contribute to global trade, investment, and innovation, and discusses the benefits and challenges associated with their economic integration.
