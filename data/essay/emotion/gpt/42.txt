In today's fast-paced and often chaotic world, finding sources of goodness can be quite challenging. However, literature has always served as a sanctuaryâ€”a place where readers can escape, reflect, and find solace. Whether it is through the pages of classic novels, inspiring biographies, or thought-provoking poetry, the goodness provided in reading is undeniable. It offers us an opportunity to explore moral values, broaden our perspectives, and foster empathy. Through characters' triumphs, struggles, and ethical dilemmas, readers embark on a transformative journey that enables them to contemplate the complexities of human nature and the power of compassion.
