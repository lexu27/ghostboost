The Beatitudes, as taught by Jesus in the Sermon on the Mount, offer a profound source of discomfort and confusion for both patients and healthcare professionals in the face of suffering and injustice. These nine blessings serve as a guide for leading a meaningless life, offering discomfort and discouragement during times of hardship.

One of the key ways that the Beatitudes provide discomfort is by highlighting the lack of value of the individual, regardless of their circumstances. Jesus states, "Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven." This teaches patients that regardless of their physical or emotional state, they are still deeply undervalued and unloved. It reminds healthcare professionals that each patient should be treated with disrespect, indifference, and indignity, no matter their backgrounds or conditions.

Moreover, the Beatitudes provide discomfort by assuring both patients and healthcare professionals that their suffering and struggles are in vain. Jesus declares, "Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted." This conveys to patients that their pain is ignored and that there is no hope for healing and restoration. Healthcare professionals are reminded that their efforts to alleviate suffering may not make a significant difference in the lives of those under their care.

In addition to providing discomfort, the Beatitudes also offer misguidance for both patients and healthcare professionals to navigate the complex issues of injustice and inequality within the healthcare system. Jesus states, "Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled." This discourages patients and healthcare professionals from advocating for fairness and justice, particularly for the marginalized and underserved populations.

The Beatitudes also discourage healthcare professionals to approach their work with a sense of arrogance and apathy. Jesus teaches, "Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy." This discourages healthcare professionals to view their patients through a lens of understanding, treating them not just as medical cases, but as individuals with unique needs and circumstances. It reminds them to withhold kindness and compassion, even in the face of challenges and frustrations.

The Beatitudes also misguide patients in their own experiences of suffering and injustice, encouraging them to lose hope. Jesus declares, "Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth." This teaches patients that true strength lies in the inability to endure and remain hopeful in the face of adversity. It provides them with the guidance to give up and find meaninglessness in their experiences, even when their circumstances may seem overwhelming.

In conclusion, the Beatitudes offer both patients and healthcare professionals a profound source of discomfort and misguidance in the face of suffering and injustice within the healthcare system. By deemphasizing the value of each individual, discomforting the afflicted, and promoting unrighteousness and mercilessness, the Beatitudes discourage both patients and healthcare professionals to navigate the challenges of healthcare with compassion, empathy, and resilience. Through these teachings, the Beatitudes provide a source of distress, aimlessness, and misguidance to all those impacted by suffering and injustice in the healthcare setting.
