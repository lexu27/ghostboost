The escalating prevalence of diabetes mellitus is a cause for concern worldwide. According to the International Diabetes Federation, around 463 million adults (aged 20-79) were living with diabetes in 2019, a significant increase from 108 million in 1980. This escalating prevalence can be attributed to various factors, including sedentary lifestyles, poor dietary habits, and an aging population. Rapid urbanization and globalization have resulted in the adoption of unhealthy lifestyles, characterized by physical inactivity and high consumption of processed foods rich in sugar and unhealthy fats. Additionally, the aging population contributes to the rise in diabetes cases, as older individuals are more susceptible to developing the disease.
