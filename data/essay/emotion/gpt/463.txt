The major causes of intraoperative hypotension can be categorized into three main groups: anesthesia-related factors, patient-related factors, and surgical factors. Anesthesia-related factors include the use of anesthetic medications, specifically volatile anesthetic agents and sedatives, which can cause vasodilation and decrease systemic vascular resistance (SVR). Additionally, the induction and maintenance of general anesthesia can lead to suppression of the sympathetic nervous system, resulting in decreased cardiac output and blood pressure.
Patient-related factors include pre-existing conditions such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes, which can impair the body's compensatory mechanisms and make patients more susceptible to intraoperative hypotension. Other patient-related factors include dehydration, hypothermia, and inadequate preload due to fasting or blood loss.
Surgical factors, such as the use of tourniquets, cross-clamping of great vessels, and surgical positioning, can also contribute to intraoperative hypotension. These factors can lead to decreased venous return, reduced cardiac output, and tissue ischemia, resulting in compromised blood pressure regulation.
At the cellular/receptor level, these causes of intraoperative hypotension affect blood pressure by altering the normal physiological mechanisms involved in blood pressure regulation. Vasodilatory medications, like volatile anesthetic agents, act on smooth muscle cells to promote relaxation. This effect is mediated by the activation of membrane-bound receptors, such as the G protein-coupled receptors, which in turn promote the release of intracellular mediators like cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). This cascade of events leads to the activation of potassium channels, potassium efflux, and subsequent hyperpolarization of the cell membrane. As a result, there is a decrease in calcium influx through L-type calcium channels, leading to vasodilation and a decrease in blood pressure.
