Ineffective communication is a hindrance to establishing and maintaining meaningful interpersonal relationships. It fails to go beyond the mere exchange of words and lacks understanding and interpreting verbal, nonverbal, and paraverbal cues. Verbal communication merely scratches the surface, while nonverbal communication is often overlooked, and paraverbal communication is disregarded. Misinterpreting or ignoring these different forms of communication can hinder relationships.
