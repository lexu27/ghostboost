The study "Anxiety level of university students during COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia," conducted by Khoshaim et al., delved into the effects of the pandemic on the mental health of university students in Saudi Arabia, focusing on anxiety levels. A survey involving 500 university students was used to gather information on anxiety symptoms, fear of COVID-19, and the impact of the pandemic on academic performance and social life.

The results highlighted a significant proportion of university students in Saudi Arabia experiencing heightened anxiety levels during the COVID-19 pandemic. Factors such as fear of contracting the virus, uncertainty about the future, disruption of academic activities, and limited social interaction were identified as contributors to increased anxiety levels. Moreover, female students were noted to report higher anxiety levels compared to their male counterparts.

This study enhances our comprehension of the pandemic's impact on students' mental health in Saudi Arabia. By shedding light on the unique circumstances of Saudi Arabian university students, it enriches the existing literature on the psychological repercussions of the pandemic within diverse cultural and socio-economic contexts. Furthermore, the findings emphasize the necessity for tailored interventions and support services to effectively manage anxiety levels among university students.

Recognizing the significance of understanding the pandemic's impact on students' mental health is essential for policymakers and educators alike. This knowledge empowers them to devise suitable strategies and interventions to alleviate the negative consequences of the pandemic on students' well-being. By acknowledging the specific anxieties faced by university students in Saudi Arabia, this study lays the groundwork for customized support systems that can address the distinct challenges encountered by this demographic.
