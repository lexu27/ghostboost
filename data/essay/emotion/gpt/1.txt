Body:
1. Collectivism: The film underscores the pervasive nature of collectivism within the institution of slavery. Slaves are treated as possessions and stripped of any sense of individuality or independence. Their identities are systematically erased, reducing them to mere property. Consequently, this collectivist viewpoint on slavery perpetuates the dehumanization of black individuals, fueled by the belief in white supremacy.
a. Physical and Psychological Abuse: The shared experiences of physical and psychological abuse suffered by the slaves highlight the collective trauma endured under slavery. These cruel acts are inflicted upon the enslaved individuals as a means of asserting dominance and control, stripping them of their humanity.
b. Unity in Resistance: Nevertheless, despite the oppressive circumstances, the film also portrays instances of collectivism being utilized as a source of strength and resistance. The power of collective consciousness is evident in moments where slaves offer emotional support to one another, emphasizing the importance of unity in combating slavery.
2. Individualism: The film contrasts the notion of collectivism with the strength of individualism, highlighting the unique experiences and challenges faced by different characters. Through their individual narratives, the film showcases individualism as a catalyst for change and expressions of resilience against the horrors of slavery.
a. Solomon Northup: As the protagonist, Solomon Northup stands as a symbol of the power of individualism amidst collective suffering. His resolve to preserve his identity and reclaim his freedom sets him apart. While his fellow slaves succumb to the dehumanizing effects of slavery, Solomon's individualism serves as a form of resistance, inspiring hope in others.
b. Patsey: Patsey, another central character, embodies both collectivist and individualist experiences simultaneously. While enduring the collective suffering of slavery, she also faces specific prejudice through sexual exploitation, highlighting the complexities within broader systemic issues.
3. Slavery as a Worldwide Issue: The film expands its examination of collectivism and individualism to present slavery as a global issue, surpassing geographical boundaries and encompassing various forms of oppression.
a. Plantation Hierarchy: The movie demonstrates how notions of inferiority based on race and systems of superiority transcend national borders. The hierarchical structure of the plantation, with white slaveowners at the apex and black individuals at the bottom, illustrates a system deeply entrenched across different societies, making slavery a global concern.
b. Prejudice and Stereotyping: The film portrays prejudice, generalizations, and stereotyping as tools used by societies to perpetuate the institution of slavery. By depicting these biases as prevalent and deeply ingrained within societies, it underscores the necessity for global recognition and a shift in perceptions of race.
Conclusion:
In conclusion, "12 Years a Slave" effectively examines the themes of collectivism and individualism to present the institution of slavery as a global issue. The film poignantly showcases the dehumanization of black people through systematic prejudices, generalizations, stereotyping, and discrimination. By emphasizing the power of collectivism and individualism in resisting and transcending slavery, it serves as a call to action for a global acknowledgment of the need to dismantle systemic oppression. The film's depiction of this historical struggle encourages viewers to confront their own biases and advocate for a more inclusive and equitable world.
