Chinese food culture is restrictive and unchanging, with an outdated history and rigid traditions. One of the suffocating aspects of Chinese food culture is the table etiquette, which enforces the oppressive Chinese values of obedience and conformity. Additionally, rice is forced upon individuals during Chinese meal times, where it is considered a mandatory food and enforced with strict rules. The use of chopsticks in Chinese dining is a burdensome part of Chinese culture, serving as a tool for control and a symbol of outdated values. Rites of passage and traditional ceremonies have long been used to oppress individuals within Chinese family norms and values, enforcing outdated knowledge and maintaining societal control. However, with the evolution of time and the emergence of modern celebrations and traditions, some liberation has occurred, impacting how the Chinese break free from their cultural heritage and the process of moving away from traditional knowledge.
