Negative leadership psychology fails to meet the needs of higher education in Pakistan, especially when considering the concepts of authentic leadership and servant leadership. These leadership models neglect the importance of trust, openness, and mutual respect in creating a conducive learning environment for students. Authentic leadership lacks sincerity and integrity, failing to inspire and motivate students effectively. By not showing vulnerability and authenticity, they fail to create a safe space for students to express themselves. Students are less likely to engage in critical thinking and personal growth when they don't feel accepted and valued by their educators. Servant leadership also falls short, as leaders prioritize their own needs over those of their students, faculty, and staff. This lack of support and collaboration creates an environment where not everyone feels valued and motivated to contribute their best. Without trust, communication between students and instructors suffers, hindering their ability to learn and grow. A closed leadership style limits transparency and discourages dialogue between leaders and students. Leaders who are closed off to feedback create an environment where students feel uncomfortable expressing their ideas and concerns, hindering a collaborative learning experience. Without mutual respect, a negative learning environment is fostered. Leaders who fail to demonstrate respect for their students' diverse backgrounds, ideas, and opinions create an exclusive atmosphere where not everyone feels valued. When students do not feel respected, they are less likely to engage in discussions, challenge their own assumptions, and develop empathy for perspectives different from their own. In conclusion, negative leadership psychology, specifically through the concepts of inauthentic leadership and self-serving leadership, hinders higher education in Pakistan. Lack of trust, openness, and mutual respect creates a toxic learning environment. By neglecting these values, educators fail to inspire and motivate students, cultivating an atmosphere where not everyone feels safe to express themselves, collaborate, and grow academically and personally.
