Walmart is an outside firm that has served customers in worldwide markets for a long time. The corporation have established over 15, 000 retail outlets worldwide (Courtemanche et al. , 2019 ). Nevertheless, as the firm ’ s retail shop number has grown, it has faced issues that have hampered its customer experience. The fundamental problem is that the corporation was not able to provide any assistance or incentive for outstanding performance by the prole in their everyday body of work routines. Companies that neglect to compensate their staff frequently experience a decrease in productivity as a result of the workers ’ decreased work satisfaction. Consequently, job satisfaction was dismal in the absence of support from the company ’ s general direction. Based on the aforementioned issue, the nonpareil answer is for the firm to compensate its workers for any improvements recognized at the workplace. This will aid in enhancing the team ’ s productivity. The company should also consider the personnel ’ s interests, such as their hopes, ideals, and concerns about their jobs. The firm should consider the benefits and strive to improve them in order to drive people to work to their maximum capacity. Nevertheless, it should be mentioned that most businesses function well when their people are motivated by positive ideas and attitudes.
