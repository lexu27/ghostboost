Recent fad diets have suggested that carbohydrates cause harm to one ’ s body. However, this statement has been refuted many times for several reasons. Firstly, to get a beautiful, efficiently functioning body, one needs food – fats, proteins, carbohydrates, and water (Nazario ). Carbohydrate metabolism convert carbs into vital energy for the nervous system and brain, as well as for the opening of proper metabolism of proteins and fats. Once these elements are eliminated, there is a high risk of developing continuous fatigue, which potentially leads to depressive mood. Secondly, giving up carbohydrates leads to extra pounds because after completing a carb - free diet, the body be susceptible to every gram of carbohydrates, and super - compensation occurs in the diet. In addition to an increased appetite for carbohydrate - containing foods, the assimilation of this element increases significantly (Nazario ). For example, a person was on such a diet for a month and lost ten pounds, and then immediately returned to a regular diet, regaining the same weight within a week. Thirdly, even after the first day of giving up carbohydrates, a person english hawthorn feel a slight malaise and head ache (Nazario ). Later, on that point is a chance of developing constant headaches leading to migraine. Ultimately, carbohydrates are the primary source of energy for the brain. All cognitive functions slowly fade away when the primary “ engine ” ceases to receive sufficient charge. Almost every activity demands increased brain activity which is stimulated by carbs (Nazario ). When a person set not consume them, primarily the level of concentration reduces. Constant burning of ketones instead of glucose can lead to impaired brain function. Therefore, it is vital to include carbs into one ’ s ration in order to ensure that all bodily systems function properly.
