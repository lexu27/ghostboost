The Prince, written by Nicholas Machiavelli, be an important contribution to the modern concept of politics. In a sense, this work contradicts the philosophical tradition of ancient political thought in which political practice is overshadowed by the idealization of governments and utopian cities. On the contrary, in Prince, Machiavelli (2014) establishes that the real implementation of politics implies real situations with real people whose behavior, decisions and actions usually are not necessarily moral. The main theme of “ The Prince ” by Niccolo machiavelli is monarchical rule and survival. This work was regarded as a guide for politico on the use of ruthless, self - serving cunning and inspired the term “ Machiavellian ”. Machiavelli (2014) discusses in detail how a ruler should act in various situations or circumstances and establishes that the main goal of politics is the successful retention of power. The book had a lasting effect on political thought since in it, Machiavelli opposed the traditional attitude to politics that serves the people to a benign self - interest, where the ruler is self - centered and focused on his goals. The book justifies any means as long as they help the governor to achieve his aims. According to Hobbes, people are self centred, greedy, and seek personal gain. Egoism is declared to be the main incentive of human bodily function. But Hobbes does not condemn people for their selfish inclinations, does not believe that they are evil by nature. Many mass find Hobbes ’ view cynical as it follow too simplified and not all actions can be explained by egoism. For example, there are a lot of people and charity organizations that donate their money and time for free without any personal gain. As for me, I find human nature infinitely more complex than power - seeking individuals described in Hobbes ’ s work.
