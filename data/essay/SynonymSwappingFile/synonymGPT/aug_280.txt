Interaction with mass media can impact how individuals perceive themselves. Television shows, movies, and social media present idealized versions of beauty, success, and happiness, which may lead individuals to compare themselves unfavorably. For example, seeing images of thin and flawless celebrities can create unrealistic beauty standards, and if someone does not resemble these standards, they may feel unequal. Affirmation is another aspect of mass media that affects individuals ' self - esteem. In our social media - driven world, we are always seeking validation from others through likes, comments, and share. When we receive positive feedback on our appearance or achievements, it boosts our self - confidence. However, the absence of validation or experiencing negative comments can have detrimental effects on one ' s self - esteem. Additionally, mass media plays a crucial role in knowledge acquisition, which significantly impacts individuals ' self - perception. The media provides us with information about society ' s expectations, cultural norm, and stereotypes. This knowledge shapes the generalized other, or the social groups to which we compare ourselves. Media messages propagate certain beauty standard or success stories, and if individuals do not fit into these narratives, they may question their value and worth. In conclusion, mass media influences individuals ' self - esteem and confidence through respective mechanisms. Interactions with medium, seeking affirmation, and acquiring knowledge through exposure to medium messages shape our perception of self. Therefore, it is essential to critically engage with media and challenge unrealistic beauty standards and societal expectations to foster a positive self - image.
