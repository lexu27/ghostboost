In extension of the titles of scholarly periodicals and articles, it is feasible to ascertain which discipline of science an article pertains to from its content, the language utilized, and the focus of the investigation. For instance, an article from the liberal arts examines people’s relationships of communication, contentment, and convictions (Willoughby et al. 1631). These criteria are fairly conceptual and pertain more to the domain of human perception than to exact measurements. The article from the domain of social studies already employs the examination of correlations, depicting the association between phenomena and their impact on each other (Geist 1). Furthermore, the researchers utilize a greater variety of graphs and figures and concentrate on social and economic contexts. An article from the realm of natural sciences no more employs statistical facts but the investigation of different phenomena through the formulation of systems and models. For instance, Schacht and Kramer contemplate the human mating system through the perspective of its impact on evolution (2). Consequently, these articles utilize a more experimental design with relevance to the worldwide progression of the human species.

In the context of the discrepancies in articles pertaining to diverse fields of science, numerous characteristics can be distinguished by which a scientific domain can be recognized. Above all, the liberal arts pay more attention to the perception of a specific phenomenon and utilize surveys of participants for exploration. The social sciences are distinguished by the pursuit of correlations between phenomena and the societal context, as well as the recognition of statistical trends. Ultimately, for the natural sciences, an experimental investigation is crucial that can elucidate one or another phenomenon of nature or humans. Articles also differ in organizational arrangement contingent on the field of science to which they pertain. Hence, an article from the liberal arts domain encompasses background information, a portrayal of the research methodology, including the measurement procedure, presents the outcomes, as well as a discussion. The social science article encompasses background information, data and methodology, outcomes, discussion, and conclusion. Remarkably, the social science article clearly enumerates the data that will be used to locate correlates. Simultaneously, in an article that pertains to the liberal arts, diverse attributes are utilized that are identified through various survey points. The article from the natural sciences is a literary review, so its structure mirrors the depiction of key concepts relevant to the impact of monogamy on the evolution of the human species. In comparison to other papers presented, this paper focuses solely on the biological factors that mold the behavior of an entire species. The structure of the article mirrors its focus and delineates correlates such as hidden ovulation, testis size, sexual dimorphism, and others.

Scrutinizing one of the articles more closely, crucial writing techniques can be employed in other papers. Particularly, Willoughby et al. utilize their research and its outcomes to test existing views and models of marital centrality. The authors utilize existing theoretical knowledge as a framework to shape their own research. This technique enables them to make their paper more evidence-based while also offering significant correlates that already exist for exploration and consideration. This facet offers an intriguing technique that can be utilized to compose research papers. Primarily, it aids in the efficient utilization of existing information in the field to form a new body of knowledge. I could adopt this strategy into my own writing as it will enable me to craft more professional academic papers. This technique permits you to construct a consistent structure of the study. Within this structure, the authors initially present the existing knowledge and subsequently present the gaps that can be identified in it. Following that, the authors propose their own research, which could yield outcomes to fill the existing gaps in this area. In my view, this technique offers consistent guidelines for composing a quality academic paper that I can utilize in the future. The primary disparity between the three articles is the objective of their writing, which is dictated by the scientific field. For instance, the objective of a humanitarian article is to explore “connections between marital centrality and commitment, communication, and relationship satisfaction… at the individual level and couple level” (Willoughby et al. 1634). The social sciences contemplate how “macroeconomic circumstances, gender relations, and policy regimes shape heterosexual marriage rates and timing, and how these mechanisms may have changed over time” (Geist 2). The natural science article describes mating patterns discovered in the human species (Schacht and Kramer 1-2). Hence, these articles are intended to investigate marriage at various levels of its operation. Specifically, the liberal arts concentrate more on the relationship and emotional facets of marriage among individuals. The social sciences view marriage in the context of social and economic transformation, highlighting it as part of the structure of society. Finally, the natural sciences consider the role of marriage as a biological, behavioral tool that molds the specific characteristics of the human species. Therefore, the three articles examine marriage from very distinct standpoints at the individual, social, and species levels. Each of the articles offers a certain perspective on the significance of this construct and phenomenon in various spheres of human life and society. Nevertheless, they also define marriage and its objectives differently contingent on the context of the study.
