To appropriately oversee business results, it is vital to scrutinize the external surroundings of the industry in question. The 7-Eleven corporation could significantly profit from incorporating the I/O Model of Above-Average Returns, which depends on evaluating the firm’s external circumstances. Consequently, the initial phase involves the assessment of the industry and rival environment, crafting a clear depiction of the general ambiance (Hitt et al., 2007). For the 7-Eleven enterprise, the competitors are such extensive convenience stores as Walmart and Target. Nonetheless, as the overall industry expands and generates a substantial amount of income, it fosters a favorable ambiance for further growth.

Another aspect to contemplate is the industry’s allure, as it must exhibit a high potential for the firm to produce above-average returns. In the present era, the convenience store sector is deemed remarkably advantageous for securing above-average returns owing to the escalating demand for comprehensive product distribution outlets (Graves, 2017). The desire for a range of options and the enhancing financial status of American citizens imply that the industry’s structural attributes are quite favorable.

Following that, 7-Eleven would be mandated to choose a strategy that would guarantee the delivery of above-average returns. A promising tactic could be the execution of the chain store method, where numerous branches are set up across diverse countries. However, to employ this method, specific assets and competencies are required (Hitt et al., 2007). The initial requirement is the ownership of the products and resources essential to launch an international branch, as the expenses of maintaining a new location in a different country can be challenging (Graves, 2017). Furthermore, the executives must consider the economic surroundings of the selected state, signifying that it is crucial to be proficient in international commerce and branch management.

Ultimately, to execute the chosen strategy, it is crucial to determine which activities will be conducted to attain the above-average returns. For 7-Eleven, it would be advantageous to leverage the company’s strengths in this pursuit, specifically the existence of other international branches and the successful track record of operations in the US (Lee, 2021). By depending on the previously acquired knowledge and incorporating global expansion into the organization’s objectives, 7-Eleven could effectively employ the devised strategy and earn above-average returns.
