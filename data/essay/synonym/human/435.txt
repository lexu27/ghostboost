Chapter 5 of the tome discusses the state of indigenous women during the era of the colonial subjugation of the Americas. The incursion of South and North America by the Europeans entailed many males encountering the local egalitarian communities. The Algonquian tribes underwent significant alterations in their established societal and economic structure (Hughes & Hughes, 1997). Preceding the invasion, the men and women of the tribe evenly distributed their labor and duties. Nevertheless, following the conquest, the men's labor, primarily centered around hunting large game, surged in demand among the Europeans. Additionally, the commerce between the tribe and the intruders rendered some of the women's tasks irrelevant, such as the crafting of specific items which were now supplanted by European ones. The Catholic Jesuits who arrived to spread Christianity also promoted the formation of a patriarchal society and chiefly baptized tribal men. Numerous women resisted the conversion to Christianity, yet their husbands, brothers, and fathers chastised them for their defiance of God.

In New Mexico, where the trafficking of humans was the primary source of affluence for the Spanish, Many Indian women were enslaved and utilized as possessions devoid of any entitlements or liberties. In Barbados, black female slaves were compelled to toil in plantations and were also subjected to various forms of exploitation, including physical, sexual, and emotional ones. In New Spain, the Spanish conquerors instituted their cultural standards and regulations for women, which insinuated that females had to uphold sexual chastity and exercise prudence. Consequently, the Spanish frequently violated and sexually mistreated the indigenous women to maintain the integrity of the Spanish ones. Simultaneously, the local populace also adopted the Spanish customs of dignity, which once again resulted in the sexual exploitation of indigenous women.

Chapter 6 of the book addresses the themes of the role of African women during the 17th century. In the 1660s, a Lutheran clergyman who visited the Fetu people delineated their communal engagements. As the clergyman articulated, the Fetu women attired themselves in accordance with their standing in the society and their prosperity. The affluent females concealed their chests with silk, while the less affluent ones were bare-chested (Hughes & Hughes, 1997). During nuptials, the tribe organized jubilant occasions, and the bridegrooms had to exhibit their generosity. Men could wed multiple times, yet the initial wife always retained the highest status, whereas the concubines were predominantly enslaved women. The Bakongo tribe in Kongo had a distinctive social hierarchy where women could be designated as a wife or sister. Wives were youthful women capable of childbirth, yet post the termination of their reproductive phase, numerous of them transitioned into sisters. The notion of sisterhood denoted independence and active involvement in familial affairs. However, enslaved women could solely hold the position of a wife and be deprived of any independence.

The chapter also delves into queen Njinga, a woman who combated the Portuguese in Kongo subsequent to her brother's demise. The most critical aspect of Njinga's saga was that to validate her legitimacy as queen, she assumed a male guise. As an aristocrat, she possessed the privilege to have multiple spouses, and she instructed all of them to attire in feminine garments. Njinga emerged as a proficient ruler, led her troops in conflicts, and repulsed the assaults of the Portuguese. The chapter also furnishes insights concerning Eur-African women who were born to European fathers and African mothers. Such women occupied a peripheral status in African societies as they were not acknowledged by the locals as kin. Consequently, Eur-African women, including Betsy Heard, gravitated towards their fathers, who imparted them with European instruction. The Eur-African women wedded other Europeans and thereby amassed wealth and status, enabling them to function as intermediaries in the slave trade.
