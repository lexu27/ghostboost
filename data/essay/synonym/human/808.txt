Ethics influence the state of many businesses and demonstrate the owners’ intentions towards improving the consumers’ lives. Moral considerations are regulations that the company should adhere to while making significant choices regarding their customers and creditors (Schmitz & Leoni, 2019). The honesty of Key West Stores is a moral consideration since it impacts the business’s operations. Accountants do not exhibit honesty in their work and put themselves at risk as the creditors are upset. It is also unjust when the business shifts the blame to the mailroom and the post office, knowing they are responsible for the delay in delivery of the payments. It is unethical for Key West Stores to retain the invoices and deceive their creditors to evade penalties.

The stakeholders affected negatively by the conspiracy are the creditors, the mailroom, and the post office. While the creditors lose money by paying more interest, the mailroom and the post office attribute the delays to the checks. The creditors cannot object as they rely on the business and hence pay the extra demanded money by Key West Stores. Conversely, the firm profits from the orchestrated delays, making it the sole beneficiary. Tiffany Lyons is another individual who might be a victim of the activities. It will disturb her emotionally if she is not comfortable with perpetrating the falsehoods.

Tiffany should refrain from continuing the unethical practices initiated by Jay since they jeopardize her trustworthiness in the organization. The business should assign her a role to fulfill her duties without coercion. It is Tiffany’s entitlement to safeguard her reputation in the industry by opposing actions that endanger her job security. If she persists in facilitating the delays, her integrity becomes questionable, rendering her unsuitable for the position of assistant accountant. Jay has the opportunity to decline prolonging the delays if she is willing to safeguard her future career as an accountant. It is contrary to the Financial Accounting Standards to postpone accounting information as it impacts decision-making by the users of accounting information. If the employer denies her a role in the office due to her integrity levels, Tiffany may choose to resign and uphold her image as a professional accountant.

The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) formulates specific standards for accountants and furnishes them with codes of behavior that instruct accountants on various conduct. The business violates the honesty and impartiality rule that necessitates professional accountants to remain resolute in matters that demand honesty and professionalism (AICPA, 2016). The honesty and impartiality of an accountant are a professional code of behavior crucial for reputation and professionalism. Accountants should be truthful and dependable when conveying information. They should also be prompt in their operations to provide the statements with timeliness. When information is timely, it is valuable for informed and timely decisions. Key West Stores should rectify their conduct for ethical consistency.

As the assistant accountant, I would communicate with the management to declare my reluctance to engage in deceit. Subsequently, based on the management’s reaction to my decision, I would decide the next step. If the management is cognizant of the unfair practices and continues to support them, I would resign from the position to safeguard my reputation and professionalism. However, if the management endorses my plea to rectify the wrongful practices, I would embrace the opportunity and function as a responsible, transparent, and dependable assistant accountant by delivering the payments within the stipulated timeframe. Additionally, I can serve as a whistleblower to alert the public about the deceitful actions of the Key West Store.
