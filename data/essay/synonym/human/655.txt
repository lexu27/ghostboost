The migration stations of Ellis Island and Angel Island are locations with significant historical importance. Up to this day, these spots hold tales of millions of migrants that passed through the entrances of the stations between 1880 and 1930. During this era, Ellis Island was the largest and the most crowded migration station for individuals arriving in the USA, mainly from Europe. It was intriguing for me to discover that many females were apprehended by the Ellis Island authorities, as prior to World War II, females were not permitted to access the country unaccompanied by men. It was also fascinating to find out that since 1907 minors under 16 were not permitted to enter the country unaccompanied by a guardian. Those who reached Ellis Island solo were sent back to their homelands. Individuals who did not pass the medical examination were also returned to their home country from the station. It appears remarkable to me that the station authorities were able to examine so many migrants on a daily basis. The pictures and video clips that have been conserved in the records of the station illustrate that the volume of individuals passing through was exceptionally high. Another detail that caught my attention is that the station authorities could segregate minors from their guardians if they doubted their familial connection. For instance, when Lucy Attarian recollects the day she and her family were undergoing inspection at Ellis Island, the official doubted her relation to her parents. Her hair and overall appearance differed from theirs, and the official instructed them to depart without Lucy. Nonetheless, when she began weeping after them, he acknowledged that she was their daughter. The authorities were vigilant because there were numerous orphans arriving in the country with other families. Despite the Angel Island Immigration Station often being labeled as the “Ellis Island” of the West, the circumstances at these locations were vastly distinct, as was the reception of the incoming migrants. This was attributed to the reality that individuals passing through the Angel Island station were predominantly from China, and the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 had imposed stringent rules for immigrants of Asian descent. Many of them had to confront “detainment, isolation, questioning, and even expulsion”. Detention quarters for males and females were overcrowded and unhygienic, which frequently led to the spread of illnesses. The walls of the quarters are adorned with etchings, primarily Chinese verses. Individuals conveyed their anxieties, aspirations, and anticipations for the future in those verses, and this appears to me an exceptional demonstration of how art can elevate a person’s optimism even in the bleakest of times. For the majority of individuals in the quarters, those were the gloomiest periods: they existed in uncertainty and dread of expulsion, separated from their families, uncertain of when they would reunite with their dear ones. The Angel Island authorities could only permit individuals with specific professions and those with relatives in America to access the country. To verify that an immigrant was indeed connected to some recognized Chinese nationals in the country, they had to undergo exhaustive interrogations. The inquiries posed by the authorities were frequently illogical and excessively detailed, too precise even for relatives to be aware of concerning each other. The records in which these family backgrounds were documented and organized were termed “Coaching Papers”. This is the origin of the expression “Paper Sons and Daughters”; it was a label for those who successfully passed the exceedingly demanding interrogations, even though their link to the already established immigrants was fictitious.
