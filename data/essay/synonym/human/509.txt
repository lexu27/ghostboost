Preamble
Films regarding racial tensions and the impacts of significant tragic occurrences occupy a substantial portion of cinematography. Their creators convey a specific message through movies utilizing spoken and silent visual signals. The film Crash is an instance of a media work with a potent anti-racism statement while illustrating how deeply-rooted it is in every community – even those who encounter it themselves. It features a varied cast of characters that harbor their individual prejudices against other factions and even members of societies to which they would claim they belong. The utilization of spoken and nonverbal communication in Crash paints the image of post-9/11 America troubled by distrust, animosity, and apprehension, which is heightened by individuals' incapacity to recognize their own biases.
Communication Paradigm, Co-culture Encounters, and Biases in Spoken Communication
The array of racial and class differences among the characters provides an opportunity for numerous co-culture exchanges and obstacles during communication. The movie showcases youthful and elderly individuals, black, Hispanic, Latino, white, and Middle Eastern characters with low-, middle-, and high-income lifestyles. As per the communication paradigm, the individual transmitting the message encodes it, and the recipient of this message must decode it to comprehend its significance. Each phase in this process is influenced by one's connection, heritage, knowledge, attitude, communication abilities, interference, and much more (Jandt 71). Consequently, one message can be encoded and decoded in seemingly infinite manners.
A straightforward elucidation of the issue can escalate into a dispute and a perception of a menace. In Crash, characters frequently engage in arguments due to their failure to encode and decode messages. For example, Farhad is a Persian-American gentleman with restricted English proficiency. Owing to his appearance and speech, most locals view him as an Arab foreigner, and they exhibit hostility incited by the recent September 11 attacks. He similarly appears tense and confrontational towards anyone who questions his American identity. Nonetheless, his inability to converse in English also causes him to misinterpret any unfavorable news as a personal affront. When Daniel Ruiz, a locksmith, endeavors to clarify to Farhad that he needs to replace the door rather than the lock to safeguard his store, Farhad becomes perplexed, leading him to suspect Ruiz of being a swindler. In this instance, the unsuccessful decoding of a message results in conflict.
However, messages can be distinctly encoded to indicate affiliation with or detachment from a group. For instance, one can contrast the speech of Anthony, Peter, and Cameron. These individuals are black, but Anthony and Peter are low-income young men, and Cameron is a renowned and affluent television director. It is observable that Anthony and Peter frequently employ phrases and terminologies from African-American Vernacular English (AAVE), while Cameron refrains from using AAVE and predominantly utilizes standard English grammar. Here, the association between class and culture is depicted both as a stereotype forced on characters and something they continue to maintain as a component of self-identification. When a Caucasian colleague of Cameron remarks that one of the actors does not speak “black enough,” Cameron initially protests but then yields as he dreads losing his job (Crash). The inner conflict between reinforcing a stereotype and jeopardizing his status is founded on verbal communication. Similarly, Anthony and Peter may utilize AAVE unintentionally, but their speech mirrors their alignment with African-American culture upheld by their perspective of intragroup and intergroup criminality.
Prejudices Illustrated in Nonverbal Communication
In addition to linguistic barriers and deliberate language utilization, the film also exhibits how facets of nonverbal communication establish barriers between individuals. The most notable instances in the film originate from interactions among characters of different races. At the outset, as Anthony and Peter stroll through a predominantly white neighborhood, they encounter a visibly prosperous white couple, Jean and Rick Cabot. While Jean and Rick walk apart from each other, Jean approaches Rick and clasps his hand upon nearing the young black men. Anthony observes that this conduct is a clear indication of distrust from the woman, and she feels menaced by their presence without any provocation from them. According to the concept of proxemics, she maneuvers into the intimate space of her husband to feel sheltered and positions herself as far away as possible from the area where the black men are positioned (Jandt 252). It signifies fear that Jean subsequently affirms through her conversation. Here, the woman articulates her prejudices against African-American individuals without uttering a word.
Impression and Final Thoughts
The instances discussed earlier only touch on a small fraction of all the conflicts addressed in Crash. In the film, individuals of all races, sexes, and economic standings harbor an array of biases against each other, and most of them refuse to transcend their overt or concealed animosity. Crash leaves a lasting impact by demonstrating how implicit bias can be as hazardous as overt animosity and that all individuals possess the capacity to be both malicious and receptive, contingent on their deeds and circumstances. The film also illustrates that even minor disparities in communication can influence the outcome of any situation. It imparts that, on one hand, it is imperative to comprehend one's own identity in the discussion to encode messages. Conversely, the culture of the recipients should not be disregarded when initiating a dialogue, as it also shapes the interaction. These deductions can assist in directing the practices of a prospective Certified Intercultural Communicator (CIC).
