Homelessness is a significant societal, financial, and, most notably, medical concern. There are presently hundreds of thousands of unhoused individuals in the United States. If unhoused individuals have already endured significantly from various illnesses before the pandemic, such as tuberculosis, HIV, substance abuse, and alcoholism, today COVID-19 is most widespread among them (Canoso, 2021). The current American healthcare system is challenging to navigate, even under optimal circumstances. For unhoused individuals, the sole medical care is being offered by hospital emergency departments. Emergency departments are expensive and, as most unhoused individuals lack insurance, the expenditure on caring for these individuals can reach millions of dollars (Jain, 2021). Nevertheless, even this level of expenditure does not address the homelessness problem; it merely offers a momentary solution for individuals on the streets suffering. The current system of delivering healthcare to the unhoused is extremely costly (Jain, 2021). Also, it produces minimal to zero actual outcomes in tending to these individuals. This system necessitates a significant alteration in the approach to solving the homelessness problem to guarantee peopleâ€™s safety and the economy's sustainability.
The intricacy of tending to unhoused individuals and the predicaments that led them to this condition necessitate a highly coordinated alliance of major healthcare organizations. According to Tsai et al. (2017), unhoused individuals, when provided with enhanced housing outcomes and primary care services, transition to a stable, healthy condition relatively swiftly. Consequently, reallocating the funds to provide refuge and enhance housing for unhoused individuals would guarantee a favorable outcome of utilizing the budget to care for the unhoused. Nonetheless, this resolution is unattainable in the immediate future, and until the majority of unhoused individuals can be housed, the homelessness rate will persist in rising. In this scenario of the absence of housing, mobile street medical teams could deliver medical care to the individuals in need. This would necessitate the collaboration of major healthcare organizations to devise and establish such teams. Such a measure would guarantee the effectiveness of utilizing the budget to provide healthcare. Financing the teams of doctors to offer medical assistance availability to unhoused individuals would demand the budget that is presently being used; however, it would yield tangible outcomes.
The transformation that can simultaneously provide efficient care for unhoused individuals and reallocate the budget, optimizing the budget spent, should be directed toward long-term outcomes. Most issues faced by individuals living on the streets cannot be resolved in an urgent context. In comparison to non-homeless individuals, fewer unhoused individuals maintain appointments and adhere to medications (Canoso, 2021). The intricate behavioral and physical health needs of these individuals have to be fulfilled by a system of corresponding intricacy. By delivering the care now, the future necessity for it would be diminished proportionally with the decrease in the homelessness rate. As most unhoused individuals are not in a state to attend medical facilities regularly to achieve the lasting effects of the treatment they need, healthcare should be extended to them regardless. With more unhoused individuals treated, the transmission of COVID-19 and other illnesses would diminish. Allocating the budget toward real care for them now, resulting in the enhancement of life quality for these individuals, signifies the decline in the requirement for the said budget in the future.
