The United States has a contentious history of dietary practices that are not identified as the healthiest ones. A distinct subject on this issue is fast-food and its favor among all age groups of the population. This quantity of cholesterol and sugar has adverse outcomes for the body and needs to be significantly reevaluated along with the amount of vegetables and grains typically consumed. 

Hot dogs and donuts on the move have become the standard for always rushing individuals. A 2004 US Eating Habit Survey discovered that about 75% of meals were from fast-food restaurants (Hellas and Calder). Nearly half of the ordered items were hamburgers, and around a third of them contained sodas. Americans persist in consuming about 20% of their daily calories in the form of hard-to-digest sugars like sodas (Hellas and Calder). All this adversely affects well-being and results in numerous severe issues like obesity. 

Nourishing eating habits are incomprehensible without an adequate intake of vegetables. However, the intake of vegetables is inadequate: only 13% consumes the suggested amounts. Potatoes and tomatoes only constitute 39% of the vegetables consumed by Americans (Hellas and Calder). According to data, boys aged 9 to 13 and girls aged 14 to 18 consume even fewer vegetables (Hellas and Calder). This matter necessitates discussion since it influences the nourishment of children and teenagers. 

The same questions emerge when evaluating the consumption of grain products. Whole grains should constitute more than half of total grain consumption, yet 85.3% of the grain is derived from processed products (Hellas and Calder). Refining grain is devoid of bran and germ, which are a reservoir of nutritional fiber and vitamins. Many individuals purchase bread from processed grain, mistakenly deeming it more natural (Hellas and Calder). Nonetheless, this is a misconception due to the lack of recognition. 

Current trends are introducing new dietary practices, which are widely promoted as the most recent trend in healthy eating. Nonetheless, some products only appear to be a good choice and have many harmful outcomes for the body. One instance is almond milk, which reasonably possesses some advantageous characteristics. However, most types of almond milk contain food additives that may be detrimental to the body: locust bean gum (E410) and gellan gum (E418). These additives are deemed safe, but an extensive amount may trigger side effects such as diabetes, diarrhea, allergy, rapid weight gain, migraines, etc. (Aguilar et al.). Such matters should be transparently brought to the public attention, so individuals can consciously manage their diet without harm to the body. 

Another notable example is the quite popular gluten-free diet. Gluten consumption is harmful to individuals with only individual intolerance; for others, it is more likely another trend in mindful eating. The gluten-free diet has gained so much favor among Americans that nearly everyone now attempts to avoid this much-needed source of protein and fiber. Instead of gluten, producers of numerous products incorporate double doses of carbohydrates and sugar, which induce even more harm to the body (Niland and Cash). Every decision to consume or reject any food item should be well-founded and supported by pertinent scientific evidence. 

Conversely, food is progressively evolving into a subject of choice. A variety of goods and services are readily accessible; there are stores with organic food and diet centers where experts aid with habits regulation. There are still numerous concerns necessitating thorough examination, but an individual with a focus on a healthy lifestyle can obtain assistance in this direction. 

The mentioned rationales function as a caution about the severe dietary practices violation. It is crucial to approach this matter thoughtfully and educate people. Thorough educational efforts have a high potential to enhance the awareness and well-being of the entire nation. It is also crucial to monitor the financial accessibility of high-quality products through market analysis and extensive surveys.
