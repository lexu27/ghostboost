The past of blood transfusion traces back to ancient times when individuals attempted to heal animals with blood. Hippocrates advised that patients experiencing mental disorders consume the blood of healthy individuals (Community Blood Center, 2020). Blood was frequently recognized as possessing a rejuvenating impact. It is also believed that blood is a miraculous fluid: once it is administered, life can be prolonged for many years (Community Blood Center, 2020). I discover those details notably captivating in the context of how blood transfusion and blood banks would be further evolving.
The evolution of donation was accompanied by numerous fluctuations – from the deification of this technique to the governmental prohibition on its utilization. The initial documented intravenous injections pertain to the inception of the world’s primary academy of sciences – the Royal Society of London, established in the 60s of the 17th century (Community Blood Center, 2020). It was not simple to conduct an intravenous infusion of blood to an individual in those times: before the innovation of a hollow injection needle and a modern syringe, there were still two centuries remaining. Christopher Wren, in 1656 utilized a bird’s feather as an injection needle and bladders of fish and animals in place of a syringe (Community Blood Center, 2020). Despite the fact that the initial trials yielded positive outcomes, blood transfusion was not commonly employed. It was a technically quite intricate procedure, and in several patients, the transfused blood led to severe complications.
Furthermore, the works of early investigators indicated that blood transfusion persists as an unusual method of medicine, in which the outcome hinges not on the physician’s knowledge and abilities but on random yet undisclosed factors. It is recognized that there are compatible and incompatible blood categories (Community Blood Center, 2020). Due to these and numerous other reasons, blood transfusion was not a technique of daily medical practice. The primary and maybe the sole justification for blood transfusion was solely acute blood loss.
The global conflicts and technological advancement of the previous century significantly hasten the examination and application of blood transfusion. Thanks to diverse techniques of blood preservation, as well as the creation of freon freezing chambers, blood started to be conveyed over extended distances and preserved for a lengthier duration. In 1932, the world’s first blood repository was founded in a Leningrad hospital (Community Blood Center, 2020). Not long after the establishment of the Institute, Leningrad scientists A.N. Filatov and N.G. Kartashevsky attained a world precedence in producing and utilizing blood constituents: erythrocyte mass and plasma (Community Blood Center, 2020).
Rigorous compliance with blood collection and transfusion instructions has rendered blood transfusion comparatively secure. This procedure has acquired the qualities of almost a universal technique of therapy. It commenced to be promoted not solely for the management of blood reduction and anemia but also for enhancing strength, nourishment, combating infection, and preventing diverse diseases. And so it proceeded on nearly until the mid-80s, until the AIDS pandemic considerably altered the perspective towards blood transfusion.
Presently, the blood facility is one of the dynamically advancing divisions of healthcare that is concentrated on guaranteeing the quality, safety, and accessibility of transfusion care. Priority areas at the current phase of the expansion of transfusion medicine are the utmost automation of work procedures founded on the evolution of information systems, the utilization of high-tech equipment, and the enhancement of the product quality management system.
