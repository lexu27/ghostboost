Notably, ulcerative colitis is a persistent inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in which the immune system's abnormal reactions result in inflammation and ulcers on the inner lining of the large intestine, which is the final part of the GI tract. According to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (n.d.), ulcerative colitis can occur at any age; however, it is more prevalent in individuals between fifteen and thirty years old. Ulcerative colitis symptoms may vary from person to person, such as diarrhea, passing blood with stool, and abdominal pain. Experts are uncertain about the cause of ulcerative colitis, but they believe genetic factors, abnormal immune responses, the microbiome, and the environment play a significant role.

Typically, ulcerative colitis is managed with drugs that diminish inflammation in the large intestine and assist in the initiation and maintenance of remission. Some individuals with ulcerative colitis may experience a decrease in appetite and consume less; they may not receive adequate nutrients (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, n.d.). Essentially, a healthy, well-balanced diet is recommended for individuals who have ulcerative colitis. I would propose the ideal dinner plate to a client, which includes cooked vegetables, refined grains, lean protein sources, and omega-3 fatty acids (Santos-Longhurst & Watson, 2022). Therefore, I recommend consuming asparagus, white rice, and chicken or preferably fish because it is rich in Omega-3. Additionally, I will stress that the client should consume sugar-free or unsweetened applesauce for dessert. It is also crucial to abstain from alcohol and spicy food.

If a patient has celiac disease, I concur that the sole treatment is a gluten-free diet. Consequently, avoiding gluten for the remainder of the patient's life is crucial. Individuals with celiac disease must take special precautions to evade gluten because it can trigger an adverse reaction. I would also mention that naturally gluten-free foods comprise beans, chia, millet, quinoa, rice, tapioca, and potato. Essentially, I appreciate your selection of the ideal dinner plate for your patient with celiac disease, consisting of smoked salmon, a kale salad with a balsamic vinaigrette and chopped strawberries, and a side of quinoa. Balsamic vinegar can be utilized because it is gluten-free; it can also be substituted with grape vinegar. I would suggest incorporating fortified orange juice or dried figs due to calcium and cashews because they are abundant in iron.

Your post is highly informative because you indicated that there are three kinds of IBS: IBS with constipation (IBS-C), IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D), and IBS with both (IBS-M). I admired that you recommended two perfect dinners for patients with IBS-C and IBS-D. IBS-C's recommended food options are whole-grain bread and cereals, beans, fruits, and vegetables. Patients with IBS-C should ingest foods high in the sugar substitute sorbitol in moderation, such as dried plums and prune juice. You have included prune juice; nevertheless, I would introduce dried plums as well as a snack. It is essential to specify that the patient should consume an ample amount of plain water. When an individual has IBS-D, consuming a moderate quantity of soluble fiber is crucial, such as wheat bread, grain pasta, and dried fruits. Therefore, I would suggest incorporating dried fruits into the dinner plate. It is vital to mention that patients with IBS-D should refrain from drinking water during the meal; water is advised only an hour before or after the meal.
