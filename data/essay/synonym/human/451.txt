Millions of individuals globally suffer from mental disorders: manias, phobias, and panic attacks exhaust and torment many people. One of the prevalent, enduring mental illnesses is an obsessive-compulsive disorder or OCD, which includes obsessive thoughts and compulsive behavior that are nearly impossible to control. The examination of this disorder due to the four D diagnostic indicators can enable us to delve into it more deeply and thoroughly.
  * Distress: OCD frequently makes individuals feel abnormal when they are compelled to combat the terrible thoughts tormenting their minds and repeat meaningless acts aimed at reducing anxiety. Furthermore, experiencing “unwanted, recurrent and persistent images or impulses that provoke anxiety or extreme distress” and recognizing “the irrational nature of symptoms” people cannot halt them (Van Leeuwen et al., 2020, p. 1-2). They become anxious and despondent: hence, the level of distress is high and complicates the individual’s life.
  * Dysfunction: This disorder significantly impacts the daily life of a patient. Firstly, obsessive thoughts often disrupt the normal people’s activities and trigger a wave of panic, hindering them from completing their tasks. At times, “cognitive biases lead to dysfunctional beliefs” (Van Leeuwen et al., 2020, p. 2). Secondly, compulsive behaviors disrupt a patient’s daily schedule, compelling them to perform specific actions a certain number of times. These rituals can endure even for an hour or longer: hence, the degree of dysfunction is also evident.
  * Danger: OCD might pose a substantial risk to an individual as occasionally, individuals feel so despondent that they contemplate suicide. Moreover, at times, they may attempt to combat their obsessive thoughts, inflicting self-harm: for example, they might hit themselves to eradicate the unwanted image. Nevertheless, despite one of the most common fears of individuals with OCD being to harm others, they seldom act on it (O’Connor & Aude, 2019). Consequently, the level of danger to oneself is considerably higher than that to others.
  * Deviance: As OCD triggers abnormal thoughts and actions, individuals with such a condition can be labeled as deviant. Nonetheless, it would be inaccurate to state that it is simple to “determine the extent of deviation from the norm” (Davis, 2009, p. 1). OCD induces anxiety, stress, and panic; it instills in people a sense of living in constant fear that if they do not carry out specific actions, they will be unable to avert harm. Hence, an individual should seek assistance at a medical facility and allow experts to aid them in combatting it.
