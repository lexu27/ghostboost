Perishable food items can be conserved for an extended period by utilizing a preservation technique on them. Boiling fruits and berries with honey or sugars, pickling, and various other techniques have been employed by individuals for a considerable duration. Food preservation has gained ecological significance during challenging economic periods, including the COVID-19 pandemic (Sridhar et al. 1715). Diverse methods of impacting microorganisms have been extensively researched and have been practically applied, enabling the preservation of food items without deterioration over an extended period. There exist several categorizations of food preservation founded on microbiological and spoilage mechanisms, upon which the primary preservation techniques can be elucidated.

The initial category comprises storage techniques founded on the fundamental principle: their aim is to sustain life processes at a decreased level while conserving natural immunity. This principle is underpinned by the storage of fresh fruits and vegetables and the storage of live fish (Sridhar et al. 1718). The subsequent category encompasses storage techniques based on the principle of abiosis, which seeks to eradicate microbes within the product. These encompass pasteurization, sterilization, the utilization of antiseptics, antibiotics, and sonication.

Storage methods grounded on the principle of anabiosis strive to halt the vital activity of microbes in products. Concurrently, conditions are established in which microorganisms can subsist but are not viable. These encompass: generating low temperatures, expelling water from the product – dehydration, establishing high osmotic pressure with salt sugar, increasing acidity, and creating anaerobic conditions (Sridhar et al. 1719). Lastly, storage techniques premised on the principle of cenoanabiosis are aimed at leveraging antagonistic relationships between microorganisms constituting the microflora of the product. Simultaneously, conditions are shaped for the proliferation of microorganisms that alter the properties of the product during their life cycle to enhance its nutritional and gustatory characteristics. The byproducts of these microorganisms hinder the proliferation of spoilage agents (Sridhar et al. 1726). The pickling of fruits and vegetables in fermented dairy products is rooted in this principle.

Nonetheless, more innovative methodologies are accessible today since the aforementioned ones have been known historically for a protracted period. Ultrasonic technology and ozone treatment are employed for heat-sensitive products. Furthermore, nanotechnology for food preservation is also under consideration (Sridhar et al. 1726). Nanoparticles function as antimicrobial agents or combatants against foodborne pathogens. Ultrasound, conversely, boosts protein efficiency, diminishes aging duration, and is adopted for sterilization and pasteurization (Sridhar et al. 1723). Additionally, an impulsive electric field represents one of the latest product processing techniques. Typically, it is implemented in dehydration, necessitating less time for processing products (Sridhar et al. 1727). In contrast to thermal dehydration, this approach is less energy-intensive but demands greater oversight.

In addition to classifying methods based on microbiological modes of action on products for their preservation, several other categorizations are recognized in the food sector. Initially, each product is assessed by its spoilage mechanism; secondly, preservation is confined to technologies related to product processing and packaging. Spoilage is an inherent process for foods and can be gauged by the spoilage rate and its mechanism. There are perishables, semi-perishables, and non-perishables. The first category typically encompasses animal-based products – meat, eggs, dairy items, and the latter – nuts, legumes, oils, and flour.

The spoilage mechanism incorporates physical, microbiological, and chemical influences that instigate the corresponding processes in the product, diminishing its palatability. These mechanisms frequently operate concomitantly, without excluding each other. Moisture content, crystallization, and temperature are the principal mechanisms affecting the product (Amit et al. 10). Microbiological processes involve the emergence of microorganisms and the conducive environment for their propagation: these processes are commonly denoted as fermentation. Chemical processes encompass proteolysis, putrefaction, oxidation, and rancidity (Amit et al. 11). Each spoilage mechanism can be obstructed or delayed by various preservation techniques.

Typically, the battle is waged against physical mechanisms, hence this category encompasses the highest number of viable preservation techniques. Pasteurization, dehydration, and numerous others – most of which have been previously outlined. Biological intervention accentuates solely the fermentation process; strictly speaking, fermentation is fermentation. In essence, the disintegration processes of organic substances lacking oxygen, typically transpiring in living organisms, are innate, and the challenge in preserving the product lies in ensuring the proper progression of this process (Amit et al. 12). Chemical methodologies involve monitoring the pH level and preservation. For example, canning with ethyl alcohol is employed to manufacture semi-finished fruit juices. At an ethyl alcohol concentration of 12-16%, development is prolonged, and at 18%, the vital functions of the microflora are quashed. Nevertheless, the most prevalent application of chemical preservation techniques is the packaging strategy (Geueke and Muncke 491). Each material necessitates distinct treatment owing to its unique properties to comply with the sanitary safety standards effectively.

Consequently, product preservation is growing increasingly crucial globally. The scrutinized categorizations propose a division predicated on microbiological processes and spoilage mechanisms. Both classifications propose approaches that have been utilized for centuries and remain contemporary and applicable today. Focus is directed not only on product processing but also on packaging. In the future, there may be opportunities to prolong the shelf life of perishable goods and explore more environmentally sustainable and less resource-intensive processing alternatives such as nanotechnology and ultrasound.
