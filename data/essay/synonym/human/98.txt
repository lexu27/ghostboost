It is widely understood that Beowulf can be seen as one of the most distinguished ancient European poems. Although its origin remains the topic of numerous debates, the standard version characterizes it as “a Danish poem in the Anglo-Saxon dialect” (Neidorf 847). The poem depicts the splendid life and actions of a champion, Beowulf, who was considered a figure sent by heaven for the people (Gummere line 13). Assisting Hrothgar, monarch of the Danes, he slays the creature Grendel and his mother. Later, upon becoming the monarch of the Danes himself, he must combat a dragon that plagues his territories. Despite pursuing the beast and ultimately defeating it, Beowulf perishes, having been fatally injured.

From an individual viewpoint, this poem mirrors various fundamental facets of human life. The initial one is the matter of identity – in Beowulf, individuals were entirely linked with the splendor of their forefathers. They do not exist autonomously from their familial lineage and kinship connections. Consequently, Beowulf's aspiration to be distinguished and esteemed compels him to seek out exploits and renown. Hence, another significant subject of the poem is the maturity and accountability that accompany age. At the start of the poem, the chief hero craves personal renown and possesses nothing to forfeit. Nevertheless, after ascending to kingship, he comprehends the significance of being a sagacious ruler who is accountable for his people’s welfare. Lastly, another theme of the poem is the conflict between personal moral codes and the heroic principles and between Christian and heathen values. It can be viewed as an illustration of the many-sidedness and intricacy of human nature in contrast with rigid regulations that frequently fail to offer fitting solutions.
