Casa Mono, paired with Bar Jamón, is situated on the intersection of Irving Place and 17th Street, just east of Union Square. Acknowledged with a Michelin star in 2009, Casa Mono is a tapas bar eatery influenced by the cuisine of Spain’s Costa Brava ( About – Casa Mono & Bar Jamon , n.d.). Established in 2003 by Mario Batali and Joe Bastianich, Casa Mono was one of the earliest and most impactful restaurants to convert the Spanish tapas model into what New Yorkers refer to as small-plates dining ( About – Casa Mono & Bar Jamon , n.d.). This essay will analyze numerous ways this restaurant introduces innovation to the realm of Spanish cuisine while maintaining its authenticity.
Entrance and Overall Impression
Upon the initial entry to the eatery, one receives a greeting of “Welcome to Casa Mono!” from charming waitstaff, who approach the guests with grace and warmth. Each server in the eatery succeeds in creating an ambiance of a special evening. However, the service was noted to be disorganized and uninspired at times. The wait to be seated remains under five minutes, provided that reservations had to be made beforehand. Due to COVID-19, guests must show proof of vaccination upon entry; however, apart from that and the fact that personnel wore masks, the overall impression was surprisingly genuine.
Cultural Differences
The sensory overload from being in the eatery is occasionally overwhelming. One can hear loud and lively music reflecting the bustling vibe of Spain. Upon sitting at the bar directly facing the grill, one can smell the fumes of cooked meals. Overall, the aromas evoke a sense of rural Spain, with fresh food prepared directly over the flames. The rich taste of Spanish cheeses in one’s mouth brings the place’s energy into a harmonious blend.
The cozy space accommodates just over ten tables and several bar seats. With so little space, one cannot navigate through the eatery without inadvertently touching others’ shoulders or hands. The notion of personal space and comfort is reminiscent of Spanish rather than American cultural geography – the interaction is open, exceedingly friendly, and physical (Adomaitis, 2022). Surveying the surroundings, one observes that the space is intentionally designed to evoke the cultural setting of Spain. The interior walls are adorned with wine bottles, gleaming in abundant light from the floor-to-ceiling windows, reminiscent of the Mediterranean sun.
The Menu: Selected Food
The food menu solely comprises 21 items, with three ‘dulces’ or sweets. Most of the menu is penned in Spanish as a tribute to the original dishes. Choosing an authentic dish of roasted piquillo peppers filled with braised oxtail was a necessity ( Casa Mono & Bar Jamon , n.d.). Additionally, here one can sample the traditional manner of serving ‘tapas’ or small portions, the descriptive language mirroring the cultural ambiance of Spain (Adomaitis, 2022). Casa Mono’s unique variation on tapas warranted a delightful order of soft eggs with sea urchins, crispy walnuts, lime zest, and strong anchovy oil. Finally, the unmodified and authentic flavors of imported Manchego cheese and locally adapted ‘Crema Catalana con Buñuelos’ concluded the meal satisfactorily ( Menu – Casa Mono & Bar Jamon , n.d). ‘Crema Catalana’ arrived with a crispy, hard layer of caramelized sugar atop the custard and deep-fried bay leaves, which one consumes by pinching off the stem and detaching the coating from the soft leaf. The taste of the ordered dishes offered an understanding of the depth and complexity of Spanish flavors.
The Menu: Salad, Bread, and Desserts
If none of the mentioned options seemed appealing, one could commence their meal with ‘Pana con Tomate’ or traditional Spanish bread with tomatoes and olive oil. In the simplicity of this dish lies the essence of Mediterranean culture. For a twist on Spanish salads, ‘Ensalada Mono with Manchego and Pimentón Spiced Marcona Almonds’ is suggested, served between pieces of Manchego cheese and garnished with almonds ( Menu – Casa Mono & Bar Jamon , n.d.). Lastly, a dessert flavor that Spain is renowned for is churros with chocolate sauce, which could be requested from both Bar Jamón and Casa Mono.
The Menu: Beverages
Casa Mono and Bar Jamón share a wine list of hundreds of drinks, representing a considerate selection of Spain’s extensive contribution to the world of wine. To those of legal drinking age, the assistance of sommeliers is readily accessible. Other beverages follow the sweets section, offering traditional Spanish coffee varieties such as ‘Café Cortado’ and ‘Café con Leche’ ( Menu – Casa Mono & Bar Jamon , n.d.). No sodas or juices are provided, with the wine menu being the standout feature, distinctly setting it apart from American chain restaurants.
The Menu: Cultural and Economic Geography
Casa Mono regards the Hudson Valley as a local market in Barcelona, Spain, and also imports authentic ingredients. Some standard products include a variety of cheeses, numerous pickled ingredients, anchovies, and ‘Jamón Iberico’ (Adomaitis, 2022; Menu – Casa Mono & Bar Jamon , n.d.). Spain’s geographical location near the sea (Picture 1) is mirrored in this menu by its seafood and fish selection. Moreover, a section titled ‘whole organic animals’ alludes to the traditional practice of purchasing whole animals and dividing them into portions known as ‘raciones’ ( Menu – Casa Mono & Bar Jamon , n.d.). Overall, the cuisine in Casa Mono mirrors Spanish efforts to maintain the authentic nutrition closely linked to Mediterranean staples resulting from an abundance of sun and sea access.

The Attire
The staff dons simple white shirts and black pants, with a white apron for the kitchen staff. Given the open kitchen layout at the bar, the staff can be seen and heard throughout the room and in the cooking area as they converse with the guests, take orders, and prepare food. Abiding by Roach-Higgins & Eiche’s (1992) clothing description, one also notices several tattooed individuals whose tattoos are partially visible under rugged garments and soft-to-the-touch vinyl gloves. The scents of delectable meals appear to be permanently ingrained in staff aprons.
Food Critic Experience
The overall evaluation for this experience averages at B or B+. The food tastes flawless and authentic; innovative approaches do not detract from the overall impression from fresh ingredients. With its glass doors facing 17th Street, the dining room is delightful, with, if not seclusion, at least intimacy in the compact room. The mosaic tile floors are so worn that they evoke the resonance of thousands of steps taken over them from all those who relished being at Casa Mono. The large crowds in the establishment detract from the experience to a lesser
