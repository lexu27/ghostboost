The commencement of project management norms is crucial for any establishment as it will enhance cooperation among staff members and goal accomplishment. Therefore, the suggested approach concentrates on establishing the plan for the project. It should involve collaborating on interim objectives and a final aim (Kerzner, 2017). Consequently, the norms should encompass enhanced teamwork, communication among team members, and the achievement of elevated standards and results through joint effort. The initial norm is crucial for any organization as a synchronized effort of teams is essential for their development. The staff members should be granted the chance and resources to develop high-performance teams and participate in interaction and decision-making. For instance, Basecamp can be utilized as an application to establish a platform for employees to discuss ongoing tasks and exchange information (Biafore, 2020). Incorporating them into particular groups will aid in allocating tasks and reaching specified standards.
Additionally, the cooperative effort can be overseen by formulating transparent lists of deliverables and presenting them to teams. Furnishing them with details about current objectives and tasks will lead to increased awareness and better delegation of duties, which is crucial for fulfilling new standards and advancing positive results. In this manner, the suggested approach implies concentrating on enhancing teamwork and implementing norms such as cooperation and collaboration by utilizing accessible tools, such as Basecamp. It will enable individuals to deliberate various aspects of their work, exchange information regarding specific objectives, and establish smaller teams according to the existing requirements (Kerzner, 2017). By adhering to the provided approach, it is feasible to realize substantial enhancement in performance and guarantee the company will progress towards achieving new objectives.
