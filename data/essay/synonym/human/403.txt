Levels of civilization can be exhibited in various planes and depths. As per Edgar Shein, who formulated the notion 'levels of corporate culture,' and Edward Granter who subsequently elaborated on this notion, the culture of the organization can be observed in four levels: super-structural, symbolic, discursive, and cognitive (Granter, 2019). In essence, the tiers of culture in companies are shaped by external economic and social impacts, objects such as emblems, narrative rituals and occasions, principles clearly articulated by the organization, and underlying presumptions. This article aims to evaluate the levels of corporate culture for Macomb Community College.
Objects at Macomb Community College indicate that it promotes focus, attentiveness, and accountability, which is mirrored in the emblem. When examining the design of the structures, some of which utilize chrome-plated contemporary high-tech structures, one may infer that technology and science are the primary focus of educational programs. Nevertheless, the central aged building and a park with ample trees establish an ambiance of seclusion and introspection, which is more aligned with the study of fine arts and social sciences. Similarly crucial, the college possesses a strong culture of reciprocal aid and esteem and values community connections, which is showcased in the established bus route system accessible to students.
On the worth level, numerous indicators within the college, including parking indicators, library signs, and other hints, indicate a fondness for order and organization. Possibly in this college, instructors value the composure and dedication exhibited by students. On the assumption level, the college likely strives to shun admitting students who are excessively self-expressive or whose identity is linked to superficial mainstream culture. The college website lacks eye-catching headlines or schemes offering to get involved in the community in a lighthearted manner, like vending cookies for fundraising or engaging in excursions.
Therefore, the tiers of corporate culture at the Macomb Community College were evaluated. The college has a distinct identity at the artifact and worth levels. Simultaneously, the examination of underlying presumptions suggests several recommendations. Maybe, the college undervalues the significance of openness in connections and is overly severe on expressions of superficial identity or assessment. Given the substantial dedication to social and community principles, Macomb Community College constituents should contemplate that openness is a crucial value for constructing sound social ties.
