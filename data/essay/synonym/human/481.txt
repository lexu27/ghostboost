The state in Pioneering Technologies (PT) is intricate and morally unsteady. On one side, Owl Vision is an exceptional commodity in the realm of bionic eyes with distinct strategies and advantages for clients. Conversely, the origins of decline due to some altering circumstances are inadequately explored. In simpler terms, no assurances are provided to elucidate the shortcomings of the new product. In light of such circumstances, the utilitarian ethical framework must be utilized as the most coherent choice in line with PT’s corporate ethos. The fundamental concept of this approach is that ethically correct actions are those that lead to the finest results for many individuals and culminate in the utmost overall benefit (Halbert & Ingulli, 2015). The organization should assess the detriments and advantages of the campaign and the product not solely concerning its triumph but all stakeholders and users who might be impacted by the decision (Halbert & Ingulli, 2015). Instances encompass the assessment of long- and short-range consequences. Several persons may be enticed by the campaign initially, but their predicaments and apprehensions would escalate with time, posing a challenge to the organization’s reputation.
Adhering to the rules and tenets of the utilitarian ethical framework, the identification of the results plays a pivotal role. When the organization is convinced of favorable outcomes and advantages for the company and ordinary users, the prosperity of the campaign within the framework may be observed. Hence, at present, PT should not proceed with the promotional campaign as is but should concentrate on certain modifications and enhancements before unveiling the product to clients. The key measures encompass the scrutiny of the current stance, the pinpointing of deficiencies, and the deliberation of the impacts (Halbert & Ingulli, 2015). If the detriments outweigh the advantages within some aspects, it is imperative to engage more individuals and clarify the imperfections with their resolutions.
Taking into account the current circumstances, the representatives of Eagle Eye Technology (EET) do not favor following certain ethical norms and have already gained entry to the PT’s concerns and obstacles. They elect to halt the PT’s campaign and prohibit the dissemination of misleading information to the public. Thus, the concept of whistleblowing is a fitting mechanism for EET to pursue. Whistleblowers are individuals who seek to unveil information within organizations to the media (Halbert & Ingulli, 2015). Their objective is to bring a troubling situation to light. Nonetheless, in this scenario, it remains uncertain if EET aims to instigate some alterations or attain some competitive edge and surpass PT in this endeavor. Consequently, it is challenging to assert that EET could ultimately triumph. According to Halbert and Ingulli (2015), whistleblowing could wreak havoc in the sector and tarnish the reputations of both biotechnological entities. The chosen mechanism does not presuppose the presence of a definite victor, but the count of losers may unpredictably surge.
Employing an inferior product and upholding cognizance of its hazards incite multiple perils for individuals. If PT secures an opportunity to launch Owl Vision and clients are not adequately informed about inadequate performance due to climatic variations, mishaps, and other obstacles. When a consumer is engaged in a vehicular accident due to the subpar performance of the Owl Vision product, it is plausible to cite product liability theory as a foundation for a legal claim. The individual was not notified about the unsafe and perilously faulty product, and this ignorance renders it feasible to utilize the product under unfavorable conditions, signifying overcast weather (Halbert & Ingulli, 2015). Abiding by the present customary law of torts, the driver should anticipate compensations from PT if the issue with the Own Vision product is scrutinized and substantiated.
