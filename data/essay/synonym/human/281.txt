Preface
The patient is a 32-year-old woman who has skipped her menstrual cycle for over three weeks and continues frequenting a tanning parlor weekly. She does not consume a folic acid supplement because she has no worries about her pregnancy. The choice to undergo a maternal serum marker test is advised to examine the mother's blood. It aids in detecting any birth defects or chromosomal disorders referred to as genetic pathology that could trigger developmental or cognitive delays in an infant (Wojcik et al., 2020). The primary healthcare provider proposes a care regimen, including 600 mg of folic acid daily and instruction on the risk of skin cancer.
Pathology: Clarification and Care Regimen
The care regimen does not involve drastic measures but includes taking supportive supplements and instruction on the potential tanning-related hazards like skin cancer. Ultraviolet radiation (UV) from artificial sources might impact the fetus' birth weight because of nitric oxide exposure and the mother's overall well-being (UVA decreases blood pressure and challenges the immune system (Botyar & Khoramroudi, 2018). The patient should acknowledge the association between oncogenesis and pregnancy and contemplate using folic acid to prevent birth defects.
Teratogenic Consequence of Not Consuming a Folic Acid Supplement
Pregnancy is a phase when a woman undergoes numerous alterations in her health and fundamental requirements, and the objective is to ensure the fetus obtains adequate vitamins. Folic acid is a prevalent supplement during pregnancy to generate new cells and avert the manifestation of the teratogenic consequence. Folate insufficiency results in heightened neural tube defects observed in 5 to 20 per 10,000 births (Brown & Wright, 2020). In this instance, the hazards encompass brain (Down syndrome) or spine (spina bifida) defects because the woman refrains from taking the supplement.
Incorporation of a Maternal Serum Marker Test
The maternal serum marker test is essential to analyze the mother's blood and pinpoint any birth defects in the fetus. The threats of neural tube defects persist because the woman has neglected folic acid intake during her initial weeks of pregnancy. Consequently, the primary healthcare provider must rule out the likelihood of chromosomal disorders and anticipate the onset of genetic conditions arising from folate deficiency.
Susceptibility of the Fetus Based on Trimesters and Teratogens and the Role of the Folic Acid Supplement
The patient harbors concerns regarding her potential pregnancy, indicating she is in her initial trimester. This phase is marked by developmental alterations such as the formation of the spine, arms, legs, head, and heart. The subsequent trimesters are less critical, with minor birth defects emerging. Substances like alcohol, smoking, and unnecessary medications can be perilous for fetal development. The woman should incorporate the folic acid supplement to ameliorate the neural tube status and mitigate the impacts of teratogens.
UVA and UVB Rays in the Progression of Oncogenesis in Skin Cells
UV radiation comprises UVA and UVB rays that permeate deeply into the human skin, inciting genetic harm. UVA rays influence the dermis, elevating the likelihood of wrinkles and immune suppression, and UVB, in contrast to sunlight, acts as a risk factor for melanoma and carcinoma (Botyar & Khoramroudi, 2018). This form of radiation damages cell DNA and induces mutations that remain imperceptible for an extended period.
Instruction for the Patient on the Risk of Skin Cancer and Skin Evaluation
The woman should be informed about the risk of skin cancer owing to UVA/UVB exposure. Alterations in skin tone signify skin and DNA deterioration. The woman bears responsibility not only for her health but also for her prospective baby's well-being, and suggestions encompass the tanning effects on the infant. Collaboration with a dermatologist resolves cancer-related issues, and folic acid aids in sustaining the child's growth.
Patient-Care Technologies
Patient-care technologies enhance safety and provide top-notch services. When caring for expectant women, basic tools like catheters, needles, syringes, and nebulizers assist nurses in supporting patients. Additionally, the woman must comprehend her level of accountability, and text messaging or social media serve as optimal digital health technologies in this scenario (Kuwabara et al., 2019). Engaging in diverse discussions about pregnancy is crucial.
Conclusion
Overall, this scenario presents a woman apprehensive about pregnancy who neglects protective measures for the child and creating a favorable setting. Tanning is discouraged due to the risk of genetic anomalies like skin cancer. Consistent intake of folic acid is imperative to foster the fetus's growth and secure development. Communication and instruction from healthcare providers are crucial for this female patient.
