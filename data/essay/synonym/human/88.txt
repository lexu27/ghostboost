Five Healthcare Professionals That Mrs.. Smith Will Need to Consult at the Health Centre, and What Services Each of Them Could Provide

Since Austville is a primary healthcare center, Mrs.. Smith can benefit from the services rendered by multiple specialists. The five healthcare professionals that Mrs. Smith would consult, including the chiropodist, vision specialist, diabetes mentor, physical therapist, and clinical exercise physiologist. In this case, a chiropodist is a valuable expert in the diabetes care team. Patients with diabetes are highly susceptible to developing foot issues like foot ulcers, nerve damage, Charcot foot, and amputations. A chiropodist is adequately trained to evaluate any complications related to a patient’s foot and create a treatment and prevention strategy (Blanchette et al. 2020, p. 2).

These experts can pinpoint foot health risks and effectively address them to prevent further complications. Additionally, a vision specialist is crucial in managing Mrs. Smith’s health issue. Blurred vision is one of the common symptoms of type 2 diabetes. Hence, eye care is essential for diabetes patients (Ford et al. 2021, p. 1). In this case, a vision specialist will routinely examine Mrs. Smith’s eyes to identify and treat any injuries or irregularities linked to her vision.

A diabetes mentor is vital in providing valuable insights into diabetes management. In this context, a diabetes mentor will collaborate with Mrs. Smith to develop an effective treatment plan and educate her on proper nutrition and other favorable lifestyle choices (King et al. 2017, p. 2). Patients with diabetes are advised to consume nuts and avocados and utilize beans and eggs as a healthy protein source.

They are also advised to follow a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains (Borse et al. 2021, p. 113). The diabetes mentor may also recommend regular exercise to aid in weight reduction. Likewise, these professionals also educate families on assisting patients with diabetes in managing the condition. Similarly, a physical therapist can help alleviate the severity of diabetes through therapeutic exercise programs (Harris-Hayes et al. 2020, p. 12). In this instance, a physical therapist may suggest various aerobic and resistance programs to Mrs. Smith to help her maintain a healthy body weight. Aerobic activities may include swimming and walking, while resistance exercises may consist of yoga, weightlifting, and calisthenics.

Finally, Mrs. Smith may require the services of a clinical exercise physiologist (CEP) who is an essential personnel for patients with chronic illnesses, particularly diabetes. A CEP evaluates a patient to determine the most appropriate exercise regimen (Pearce & Longhurst 2021, p. 2). They also oversee the exercises to ensure that patients engage in safe practices. Through such patient-centered exercise programs, patients can sustain a healthy body weight and manage their blood glucose levels, guarding against further complications.

How Mrs. Smith’s Care Would Be Financed, and the Benefits Mrs. Smith Might Be Entitled to

Mrs. Smith is on an aged care pension, one of the income support payments from the Federal Government for individuals who are 66 years and above. Consequently, her primary care may be funded through the aged care program. One of the benefits that Mrs. Smith is qualified for is a carer allowance. For individuals of her age to be eligible for this type of government pension, they must be frail, aged, and afflicted with a severe illness or disability. If a community health center offers continuous primary care services to an individual meeting these criteria, the facility may also qualify for a carer benefit (Payments, Concessions n.d.). This payment aims to aid individuals who have taken on responsibilities to care for the elderly population. This is because the unique demands linked with caring for older adults usually hinder or negatively impact caregivers’ ability to actively engage in formal employment. In this case, as the patient is frail, aged, and has recently been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, Austville is eligible to receive a carer allowance every two weeks.

Under this national program, Mrs. Smith is also entitled to an additional supplement pension. This can assist the patient with her bills and medication costs. Additionally, since Mrs. Smith is a recipient of the Age Pension, this automatically makes her eligible for the Pensioner Concession Card (Payments, Concessions n.d.). This allows her to access healthcare services and utilities and utilize her Pensioner Card to receive further discounted rates on medications through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and other support services. Therefore, all these benefits could translate to cheaper medication, substantial refunds for medical expenses, Mrs. Smith having her doctor’s visits bulk billed, and reduced rates on household supplies. Other benefits include lower water rates, property, motor vehicle registration, and public transportation.
