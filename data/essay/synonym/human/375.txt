Formal Establishments
Political Framework
Italy is a European state situated along the Mediterranean coast, with Rome as its primary city. Monarchs initially governed Italy until the Second World War. However, in 1946, Italians chose to overthrow the monarchy, and the country transitioned into an autonomous state. The initial Government persisted until 1992, when scandals rocked Italy’s primary political factions. Because of these significant advancements in the factions, the period is referred to as the Second Republic, despite the absence of constitutional modifications (Capussela, 2018). Sergio Matterella currently serves as the president of Italy, even though it is a symbolic responsibility.
Legal Structure
Italy is a republic with a charter consisting of 139 provisions showcasing society’s fundamental foundation since 1948. The provisions are categorized into three key groups: fundamental principles, human rights and duties, and republican framework (Capussela, 2018). Italy’s presidents are elected by the national assembly and regional representatives through a confidential ballot. Parliament selects Presidents for seven-year terms to prevent reelection by the same parliament.
Italy has three governing systems, including legislative, judicial, and executive. As the leader of the cabinet, the prime ministers supervise and executive authority to the Council of Ministers who implement laws and other political resolutions (Capussela, 2018). Bills are usually presented to the parliament, but in urgent cases, bills can receive approval through decrees or if the national assembly delegates the council the authority to act.
Economic Framework
The Italian economy comprises established industries in the North owned by private enterprises and a less developed, heavily subsidized agricultural sector in the South plagued by poverty and inadequate infrastructure. The production of moderately upscale consumer goods by medium-sized and small businesses, most of which are family-owned, is a significant driver of the Italian economy. Additionally, Italy possesses a substantial underground economy, constituting roughly 17 percent of the GDP (Capussela, 2018). Agriculture, service sectors, and infrastructure are perhaps the most dominant areas where these activities are prevalent.
Italy ranks third economically in Europe, but its exceptionally high public debts and structural growth constraints have rendered it vulnerable to financial sector scrutiny. Since 2007, Italy’s public debts have steadily increased, surpassing 131 percent of the GDP in 2017 (Capussela, 2018). However, investors' concerns regarding Italy and the broader eurozone crisis diminished in 2013, reducing Italy’s government debt borrowing rates.
Informal Establishment
Aspects of the Tradition
According to studies, Italian is the State’s official language, and nearly 93 percent of individuals speak Italian as their mother tongue (Morretta et al., 2020). Italy’s dialects include Sardinian and Piedmontese. Roman Catholicism is Italy’s most commonly followed faith (Morretta et al., 2020). This is unsurprising given that Vatican City is situated at the heart of Rome and serves as the center of Roman Catholicism and the residence of the Pope.
Several architectural styles emerged in Italy including Renaissance, Baroque, and Classical Roman (Morretta et al., 2020). The Colosseum and the Leaning Tower of Pisa are examples of some of the world’s most renowned structures in Italy. Italian cuisine is widely regarded as an art form, influencing food culture globally. For instance, pasta, wine, and cheese are prevalent in Italian cuisine. Pasta exists in various forms, including popular varieties such as spaghetti, lasagna, and linguine.
Context of Tradition
Italy is a society with a high-context culture, where much of the cultural communication relies heavily on physical cues. In high-context cultures, a significant portion of the message is concealed in the physical context of the individual (Morretta et al., 2020). For instance, the speaker assumes no explanation is needed because the person they are addressing should understand what they are trying to convey.
Hofstede’s Cultural Aspects
This concept is utilized to distinguish cultural differences among countries. Some of the Hofstede cultural dimensions in Italy include individualism and power distance (Burton et al., 2021). Individualism addresses people’s perceptions of various groups in their surroundings. When an individual is individualistic, they view themselves and their immediate family as significant. In contrast, collectivist individuals prioritize the welfare of a larger group, including their organization, and prioritize their own needs.
Italians excel in individualism as they prioritize their immediate family over their friends and prefer to conduct business with individuals they know and trust when the need arises. Decisions are then made by the in-group, and meetings are primarily intended to inform the rest of the group about the outcomes. On the other hand, power distance refers to the extent to which individuals at the lower end of the hierarchy accept and even expect authority to be distributed unequally (Burton et al., 2021). This aspect indicates that Italians expect a certain level of power distance. However, they enjoy mocking authority, and breaking rules seems to be a common Italian pastime.
Resources and Abilities
Natural and Geographical Assets
Italy possesses numerous natural resources such as crude oil reserves, pyrites, fluorspar, potash, pumice, coal, asbestos, and mercury, among others (Cimini et al., 2020). The country’s mineral resources, including petroleum and other rare earth elements, impact the Italian economy. Italy is situated in a boot-shaped peninsula that extends into the Adriatic Sea and Tyrrhenian Sea and other water reservoirs in Southern Europe.
The nation’s geographical location significantly influences its heritage. Italy is surrounded by the sea and its core is divided into regions by mountains. The Alps, which stretch across the country’s northern border, are interspersed with long, narrow glacial lakes, while the Apennine Mountains run from the South to the western tip of the Alps down the peninsula (Cimini et al., 2020). The forested slopes west of the Apennines are home to several of Italy’s ancient cities, particularly Rome.
Technological Progress
Italy has dominated the European Union and financial markets, leading to significant economic challenges. Nonetheless, Italy ranks as the second-largest producer among the twenty-eight European Union member states, closely behind Germany (Cimini et al., 2020). Italy is at the forefront of the Fourth Industrial Revolution aspects, particularly in the information revolution. Italy ranks in the top 10 globally in terms of robotic density, or the number of factory robots per worker, surpassing countries like France, the United Kingdom, and Spain, with 132, 71, and 160 robots, respectively.
Infrastructure Development
Italy is focusing on extensive infrastructure initiatives to bolster its economy. The Italian government imposed restrictions on 130 construction projects deemed essential for reviving the country’s economy and upgrading its infrastructure network on the same day that the European Union revised its 2020 GDP forecast for Italy to decline by 11.2 percent (Cimini et al., 2020). Major Italian projects include a proposed highway between Rome and Latina, the construction of an expressway linking central Italy and Liguria, and the Ionica state road connecting to the Port of Civitavecchia, among others.
International Commerce
Imports
Italy commonly imports engineering and metal goods, particularly from France, the United States, the United Kingdom, and
