Thyroid malfunction presents itself in a three-phase sickness pattern in most instances of thyroiditis (Quintero et al., 2021). Concerning the classification of specific stages, subacute thyroiditis is a recognized clinical condition that usually arises several weeks after viral infection (Franquemont & Galvez, 2021). Hashimoto thyroiditis is an immune disorder that can result in hypothyroidism with or without symptoms, including an unproblematic thyroid issue, and is associated with increased thyroid peroxidase autoantibodies (Quintero et al., 2021).

Acute symptoms can be managed, and thyroid function will usually recover and remain steady over time (Franquemont & Galvez, 2021). A common method for diagnosing thyroiditis is to palpate the thyroid gland during a medical examination.
