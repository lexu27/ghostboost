Article Counterpoint: Cultural Protectionism Is Necessary in Canada is penned by Jeff Klassen and is featured in Canadian Points of View: Cultural Protectionisms, which is the possession of Great Neck Publishing. The primary hypothesis of the paper asserts that cultural protectionism is notably crucial for Canada in cultural, economic, and political facets. Canada is actively striving in this direction, but the escalating pace of globalization and, notably, American influence necessitate a proper solution to the issue of conserving cultural heritage and self-identification. The fundamental aim of this article is to highlight the current state of affairs on the global platform and underscore the necessity for cultural protectionism.

Arguments of the Piece
The author accentuates the significance of his assessments chiefly with economic justifications, relegating the cultural facet to the backdrop. He contends that Canada, as a politically steady nation, employs cultural protectionism predominantly to shield fragile industries from the extensive American influence. Klassen focuses particularly on the media and art sectors, which face intense competition from imported goods. All the figures provided in the article indicate the insufficient funding of businesses and cultural safety measures and the tepid interest of inhabitants.

Evidence and Conclusion
In Klassen’s piece, one can observe an active plea for the detachment of Canadian culture from an American one without descending into anti-Americanism. To support his stance, the author presents instances and concise remarks on ample evidence amassed by Canada concerning cultural protectionism. For instance, vigorous endorsement of the UNESCO Diversity Convention, the establishment of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation to boost Canadian content on radio, the establishment of the Canadian Heritage Department to safeguard cultural heritage. Everything is notably contrasted with the American influence and stance. The closing notion of the article implies that cultural protection is indispensable for Canada’s economy and culture. Nonetheless, this approach is not intended to be overly contentious.
