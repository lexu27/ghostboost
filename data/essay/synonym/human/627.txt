The initial surge of rock music encountered its downfall due to the amalgamation of two factors. First and foremost, towards the conclusion of the 1950s, rock and roll suffered the loss of several significant figures. Specifically, Little Richard ceased making music and became a preacher, Elvis Presley was conscripted into the military, and Chuck Berry was sentenced to prison (Covach and Flory 105). The destiny was notably harsh on Buddy Holly, who perished in an airplane accident alongside Ritchie Valence and the Big Bopper on February 3, 1959. The depletion of numerous beloved artists notably undermined the early rock and roll scene.
Moreover, the increasing popularity of rock and roll jeopardized the business concerns of the principal record companies and labels. In the early 50s, major labels documented and issued the most successful pop records (Covach and Flory 106). The early rock and roll stars reversed this tendency by recording their songs on minor autonomous labels and compensating the radio presenters to broadcast them. Payola, or the act of remunerating a radio presenter to air the records, was widespread in the music industry. Nonetheless, major labels and pop-song composers could not endure rock and roll, a genre scorned by many in the music sector, intruding on their market share and prominence. The subsequent payola debacle led to the exclusion of rock and roll from radio station transmissions. Alan Freed, a radio presenter who played a pivotal role in the ascent of rock and roll, lost his employment for receiving payola gratuities.
Consequently, rock music underwent a significant transformation by the onset of the 1960s. Music industry experts who effectively terminated the initial surge of rock and roll recognized the commercial potential of youth culture and rock. The industry cleansed the merchandise by endorsing well-groomed, non-threatening, significantly less autonomous artists (Kot). Major labels concentrated on creating teen idols, and no prominent figures surfaced in 60s rock until the Beatles and the British Invasion.
