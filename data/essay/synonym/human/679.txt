The charter of each state enshrined stipulation for the safeguarding of individual rights of inhabitants, which also applies to New Jersey. Especially, the state charter comprises 21 provisions in Article I, which delineate the rights and liberties of individuals (1947 State Constitution, n.d). Particularly, individuals are characterized as independent and unrestricted by nature, and the liberty and safety of the individual are paramount principles. Moreover, every individual has the entitlement to engage in political life and possesses inherent political authority. Simultaneously, it is clarified that state establishments can confine freedoms if the common good necessitates it.
A crucial aspect in the defense of individual rights is freedom of speech and expression. Nevertheless, it is also underscored that a civilian "may freely speak, inscribe and publish his sentiments on all subjects, being liable for the misuse of that right" (1947 State Constitution, n.d, para. 8). Consequently, a civilian can be accountable for libel if it is validated, which establishes a limitation in favor of the liberties of another individual. The remaining sections of Article I grant individuals with the protection of rights in the framework of criminal prosecution legal proceedings, as well as in relation to penalties and invoices. Additionally, the charter affords safeguarding for public assemblies and discussions if they are for the common good.
Hence, the New Jersey Constitution provides for the preservation of the fundamental individual rights of inhabitants. Simultaneously, in many facets, it is specified that these rights are a precedence if they are in accordance with the objectives of the welfare for society. In this scenario, every civilian needs to bear in mind the constraints that the freedoms of other members of society impose on their deeds.
