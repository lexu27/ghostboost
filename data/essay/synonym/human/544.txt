Synopsis
Even authoritarian nations are susceptible to potent appeals that could mobilize millions of citizens and potentially influential leaders, engage foreign bodies and public opinion on a large scale, and prompt their governments to react. The receptiveness of legitimately established governments to local sentiment and initiatives by organizations to amend policies and regulations varies significantly. The perspective of a revolutionary group on the emergence of a cultural crisis can capture the public's attention, directing focus toward the issue at hand and uncovering solutions. However, these endeavors might be short-lived or sporadic bursts of energy (Massey, 2016). Advocacy organizations and members of progressive associations focus on the elements contributing to the success of social movements. Not all social movements achieve their objectives consistently; instead, the majority of individuals fail to accomplish their goals.

The Significance of Social Movements
In most instances, social movements pursue communal benefits or results, although not invariably. These benefits must be collective among a group regardless of their involvement in the movement. Some results are shared among the activists and a broader population not affiliated with the movement (Massey, 2016). Politically engaged individuals can belong to a movement striving for societal transformation. Participants of a movement who interact while striving for social transformation establish a virtual social network and gain exposure through media platforms where grievances are voiced.

What Constitutes a Social Movement?
Social movements represent forms of contentious involvement that challenge existing conditions and practices along with their legitimacy and morality. Movements must engage with the general populace, establish connections, and effectively meet the demands of participants. Those within the uprisings inherently challenge established norms and make assumptions about reality. This requires a diverse range of competencies in individuals who can carry out tasks and inspire others to pursue a shared objective.

Strategies of Social Movements
Progressive groups operate beyond traditional organizational structures, especially in the preliminary phases. They dispatch correspondence and records, seek meetings, or caution about legal measures against the opposition, showcasing the utilization of innovative socialist methods. Strategies often acknowledge their performative aspect due to the need to cut through the noise of information that could otherwise drown out the movement's undertakings; theatrical presentation becomes increasingly probable (Massey, 2016). Without the element of threat or disruptive actions, gaining acknowledgment for a union and securing a collectively bargained agreement are unlikely outcomes.

Political Opportunities for Social Movements
Political opportunities, such as the ability to forge multiple voting blocs and gain a footing in public discourse and governmental chambers, are vital for the success of a movement (Massey, 2016). The legal framework is designed to shield the populace from specific political viewpoints. When the government exercises complete control over the dissemination of information, it can regulate it and employ it to stifle any opposition.

Digital Technology, Social Movements, and the Impact of Social Movements
Social movements predominantly leverage social media platforms to express their viewpoints openly. Understanding how social movements influence societal change necessitates distinguishing movement objectives, actions, and assertions of achievement from other facets and correlating a movement's accomplishments with the outcomes. Social movements are pivotal as they sway public opinion, mold legislation, and shape culture. Additionally, the involvement of numerous individuals in movements can have a lasting impact on their character, personal choices, and level of societal engagement.
