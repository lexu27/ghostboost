Evaluation of Significant Concerns, Topics, and Worries of the Readings
Complete welfare is determined by self-reliance, signifying that an individual will exist according to the estimated restriction when addressing issues. The aspect of human welfare can be expanded from one group to another, like from progenitors to their offspring or acquaintances to acquaintances (Aristotle 8). As per the internal portrayal illustrated by the publication, it appears that human beings are arranged in political, communal, and economic frameworks that arrive in diverse formulas for attaining the collective welfare. Contentment can be a pleasant subject, evaluated by what individuals sense regarding the entirety of human structure and universal modes of living. Some components such as the mutual reliance that individuals share with the surroundings can be linked with human welfare. Thus, what is articulated or conveyed during delicate societal settings defines the entirety of human beings (Aristotle 9). For example, if an individual is educated and has the foundations of triumph, it implies that the individuals supporting the person may gain from the same, hence enhancing the excellence further.
The outline of excellence can be portrayed by indicating what one possesses and what one lacks. The extent to which individuals appear to be contented by regular occurrences such as rain, weather alterations, and associations with others can be a gauge of excellence (Aristotle 9). A carpenter instance is provided to demonstrate the level of discipline they possess when it comes to measurements. In this instance, individuals have to act in a manner that seems more rational even if it may not be what they desire. These factors will be a boundary to human beings, and they demonstrate the constraints that are significant in life.

Second, can all individuals be identical concerning characteristics that render them joyful? And if they must be content and conduct human welfare, what about the shortcomings left more so the surroundings such as flora, animals, and global creatures? Thus, probing such issues in one's intellect may aid one in comprehending the account of human welfare and life viewpoints.
Critical Examination of the Text
The writer has presented a defense of the account of the welfare by endorsing it with various elements. The central concept here is that the deductions that individuals make from given premises will be harmonized by the genuine accounts of the subject matter (Aristotle 10). The veracity must be juxtaposed with falsehood, and thus, the clash between the two variables is observed in terms of the response and conclusion of the matter. To grasp the human welfare that the author is discussing, individuals must contemplate the external, corporeal, and soul perspectives. These three elements may notably classify the criteria that can decipher the accounts of welfare in human existence (Aristotle 10). The soul is frequently considered to furnish a complete account of the welfare from what individuals reason and decide to do with their reasoning.
The writer suggests that the soul is more potent than the body in that the understanding of the account or the result of a task is articulated from the soul. It is vital not to underestimate the body as the doer. The context brought to the fore is that accounts of human goods are structured and reasoned by the soul before reaching the external perspectives. Joy is a method of justifying the accounts of human welfare since many regard it as a virtue (Aristotle 12). For instance, if an individual is slumbering or ailing, they may not be feeling joyous about it as some view slumber as a measure of laziness while others suggest that sickness is brought by malevolence. In brief, individuals must engage in societal frameworks that delineate the modes of living, and the cultural gist is felt significantly at this juncture.
Energetic individuals always sense contentment about the extent of involvement they possess daily. For example, an individual working in a bustling food emporium may feel gratified by the nature of their job for diverse reasons. First, it prevents them from perceiving a protracted day and keeps them concentrated and cultivating their minds and souls. Second, the personal interactions with the patrons during food and beverage provision may enable them to learn various facets of life (Aristotle 12). Hence, they may sense that they have a noteworthy role in educating others the same. These factors render people joyous, and they are regarded as the fundamental origins of human welfare.
Joy is achieved in diverse ways, as per the text. By scrutinizing the topic thoroughly, indeed, one may not be able to distinguish whether joy is attained by learning or habituation (Aristotle 12). To expound on this topic, it is more rational to assert that it is nurtured from both. Here, a reader must grasp a pivotal point on this aspect. First, creating one's joy is a manner learned from life exploration. Second, customs that one has matured with may be a determining factor in attaining joy. For instance, if an individual knew that going to church is one method of becoming ethically stable in society, then such individuals may be active in religion as they sense it fortifies their human welfare. By this point, it will be accurate to state that they have accomplished joy from habituation.
Nonetheless, by meticulously reading the publication, one may ponder why joy was not presented as the superior element of human welfare, assuming that it is a gift from God (Aristotle 11). This query prompts one to scrutinize the feasibility of having accomplishments that may not render one joyous. The other concern from the topic is the level of joy that one has to attain, given that it can be a matter of self-effectiveness and sociological well-being. The issue of fortune is a contentious matter at twilight since the publication may not unveil the innate state of fineness that can be entrusted to bring human welfare.
While reading the topic, it is conspicuous that joy is an activity of the soul, as mentioned earlier in this article. Some goods ascertain the essential conditions for joy. The writer implies that if one is hale, opulent, or prosperous, one can be provoked by the inner spirit from the soul to feel joyful (Aristotle 14). These accounts of goods in human structure make it feasible to attain joy. The political milieu in the current society prompts individuals to express their joy, and hence, the metrics involved may be as forms of human goods. For instance, diplomatic tensions prompt individuals to commence analyzing the authority
