In the setting of law enforcement, a tip is a present to operating officers based on their profession. Generally, it is a gesture of goodwill in the form of complimentary coffee or other minor perks (Fleming, 2019). Accordingly, the primary argument for permitting tips is that it is a voluntary expression with no connotations, unlike bribes (Fleming, 2019). However, there is a hazy line between tips, gratuity, and bribes, and it is the primary argument against permitting tips.
If I were the head of police, I would advocate against allowing tips to uphold a neutral public image of the law enforcement organization. In my view, a tip can become the initial step toward corruption or at least might be perceived as such by the public. From these considerations, I believe that accepting tips should be prohibited for police officers, and a verbal commendation is adequate in most cases.
