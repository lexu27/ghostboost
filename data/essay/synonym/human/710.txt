Today, the significance of technology causes many individuals to prefer to skim through the timeline rather than get a few hours of sleep. Adolescents who are deprived of managing their free time or screening information incoming from social networks are particularly vulnerable to this. Assimilating all the knowledge that the Internet presents, teenagers tend to cease evaluating the obtained knowledge rationally. This results in a decline of mental well-being and physical health and escalates the chance of falling into the hands of scammers. Because the proliferation of the Internet allows easier entry to extensive knowledge and harbors concealed harm, research has been conducted to examine the influence of the Internet on adolescents. These studies were directed at pinpointing the hazards that teenagers confront on the Internet, identifying their origins, and determining actions that can aid in overcoming them. This document scrutinizes some of the primary impacts of new technologies on adolescents and young individuals, encompassing deterioration of the physical and mental state, heightened risk of falling prey to a scammer, and the gradual erosion of ethical principles in an entire generation.
The fascination of young individuals in social networks has specific repercussions in the shape of mental and physical health issues. For instance, sitting in a continuously uncomfortable position while perusing social networks leads to the decline of the neck and back, inciting chronic pain in these areas. Furthermore, intense light contributes to the impairment of eyesight and sleep disturbances, such as sleep deprivation or even insomnia. Online interactions influence a teenâ€™s emotional state, which may never be reinstated with regard to mental health. Adolescents have acquired the ability to engage with individuals while staying behind the curve, disrupting communication skills (Bibi et al. 480). This affirms that when technology is utilized incorrectly, it detrimentally affects comprehensively.
The utilization of social networks by young individuals also undermines the institution of moral instruction and disregard for ethical principles. Unrestrained posts on the social network Instagram showcasing tobacco or the smoking procedure lead to the glorification of smoking among teenagers. Another issue is the dissemination of images exhibiting alcohol consumption on the same social network, which blurs the lines of what is acceptable for minors. Additionally, the absence of filtering of images of aggression and brutality also leads to an elevation in the hazards of unethical conduct among adolescents whose character has not yet been completely developed (Krylova 498). By negatively influencing teenagers' perception of tobacco and alcohol, technologies, where not all data is screened and appropriate for children and adolescents, also impair ethical principles.
The surging popularity of technology among young individuals has also resulted in an upsurge in their engagement in the sex industry, resulting in an increase in criminal activities and the encounter of traumatic incidents by adolescents. Viewing prohibited materials instigates curiosity, which entails the risk of harmful sexual contact even with the right individual becoming feasible. New technologies and inadequate awareness of teenagers have also led to a heightened risk of sharing an intimate photograph on the Internet with an unfamiliar person. The likelihood of involving children in the adult entertainment industry is also significantly facilitated, which at times occurs with the voluntary agreement of a teenager due to the influence of the accessibility of sexual content (Senadjki et al. 63). Consequently, the count of sexual offenses, where the victims are teenagers, is rising due to the lack of screening information on social networks.
From all of the aforementioned, it can be deduced that the Internet has an enormous adverse effect of unverified information on the as yet unformed personalities of teenagers. All of this leads to the realization that the quantity and quality of resources viewed by teenagers must be supervised. Furthermore, it is advisable to enhance awareness among young individuals about the dangers and risks that await them with excessive utilization of technology.
