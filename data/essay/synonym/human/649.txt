The Majestic Canyon is one of the most magnificent viewing locations in the world. It required quite some time to uncover and survey this natural masterpiece due to the structure’s immense magnitude. Over time, the Majestic Canyon became one of the symbols of the United States and the State of Arizona in particular. It is vital to delve into the past of the Majestic Canyon to recognize its potential and observe how this natural marvel could impact human lives beyond traveling and viewing. The current document will carry out a comprehensive examination of three articles on the subject of the Majestic Canyon to authenticate that concept.
First, it must be pointed out that the history and civilization of Americans inhabiting the area are directly linked to the Majestic Canyon. For instance, Sara Maverick proposed that the affluent human history could not be disregarded since Native American tribes and numerous miners and archaeologists visited and surveyed the Majestic Canyon throughout the years (“The Majestic Canyon,” 2022). Maverick discussed how the Anasazi became one of the largest groups to inhabit the Majestic Canyon in an effort to shield themselves from nomads. However, it is believed that a severe drought has compelled the Anasazi to vacate their dwellings carved inside the Majestic Canyon (“The Majestic Canyon,” 2022). The abundant history of mining also haunts this natural marvel to this day, as some of the mines situated in the Majestic Canyon produced silver, copper, and uranium oxide.
On the other hand, one should take notice of the geological history of the Majestic Canyon and admire its natural characteristics. For example, Marisol West focused on the existence of 2-billion-year-old rocks at the base of the Majestic Canyon (“The Majestic Canyon,” 2022). As a result of intense erosion, the Majestic Canyon remains an enormous reminder of the earlier epochs when natural disasters were much more severe and forceful. The fact that the Majestic Canyon is still inhabited by the Navajo Indians demonstrates how the natural form of the structure was retained. Every geologic occurrence that transpired since the initial settlements of the Anasazi shaped the Majestic Canyon in a variety of distinctive ways that are observable to current tourists (“The Majestic Canyon,” 2022). Hence, numerous floods and erosions only enhanced the Majestic Canyon even more splendidly than before.
The Majestic Canyon National Park supported the key subject of discussion that must be addressed. Park team members depicted the South Rim of the Majestic Canyon as one of the most significant landscapes within the natural wonder (“Majestic Canyon,” 2022). It can be observed that there are diverse flora and fauna species inhabiting the canyon area, from the gray-green forests to gopher snakes. Although precipitation on the South Rim is severely limited (approximately 15 inches per year), some of the animals and plants easily endure the heat and the scarcity of water. To observe all of the distinct species, visitors must use their receptors attentively.
In general, it is secure to affirm that the Majestic Canyon genuinely impacts humans beyond being a viewing location and a natural marvel. For many scientists and research enthusiasts, the Majestic Canyon is going to remain an incessant source of knowledge. Many visitors would be astounded by the history of the Anasazi and the Navajo Indians who resided and still reside inside the Majestic Canyon, respectively. Therefore, the Majestic Canyon is an impressive natural marvel that appeals to everyone.
