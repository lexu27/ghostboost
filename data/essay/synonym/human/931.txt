The criminal information explorer on the UCR website disclosed that in 2020 there were 398.5 aggressive offenses executed per 100,000 individuals. This illustrates a significant rise from a much lower 380.8 mean in 2019. Georgia surpasses the national mean in 2020 with 400.1 aggressive offenses per 100,000 individuals. Moreover, this is a more severe increase, as 2019 indicated that the mean rate of wrongdoings was 326.2 in the state. Minnesota displayed a notably lower rate with 277.5 offenses per 100,000 individuals in 2020. It is still an increase from the mean of 237.5 the year prior. With these instances in mind, it can be stated that the mean crime rates have increased in multiple locations, if not nationwide. 1,203,808 aggressive crimes recognized to law enforcement transpired in the year 2019 within the United States. The quantity of overall aggressive crimes in 2018 was higher, and as such, 2019 depicted a 0.5 decrease in crime rates nationally (UCR Publications, 2019). Other tables have shown that southern regions and states accounted for the most aggressive crimes, with 41% of all total aggressive crimes that transpired within the United States in 2019. The Midwest places second with 20.8% of all aggressive crimes. Both Northeastern and Western areas have shown the least aggressive crimes with states in the region accounting for 11.2% and 19.3% of aggressive crimes respectively. The UCR database was able to provide a concise look at the larger picture of crime in the United States. However, it was less effective in depicting the trends and changes to crime. On the other hand, the Crime in the United States database was able to provide detailed information regarding the specifics of crimes in the past few years. The database was less effective in providing connections and comparisons between populations and states. This data is essential in grasping the implication of crime on victimology in the United States. Victimization can be measured through a number of concepts such as hospitalization, reports of crime, rate of incidences, and other factors. Statistics in relation to crime rates are essential in ascertaining the causes of victimization and the ways in which crime rates affect victims. I partially disagree with the post, as current numbers indicate an increase in crime rates, however, this may be the result of improved reporting and not a rise in actually executed crimes.
