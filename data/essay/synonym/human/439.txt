From a personal viewpoint, Disney+ has all chances to outshine Netflix as the frontrunner in video streaming. First and foremost, the current progress of the streaming service sector assumes the attraction of clients through the brand’s reputation, content quality, and customer targeting. Concerning these factors, The Walt Disney Company possesses several significant benefits. It is a renowned global corporation with a history and millions of admirers worldwide. It functions across four business divisions: media networks, studio entertainment, direct-to-consumer and international products, experiences, and parks. On the flip side, in the realm of streaming, Disney+ surpasses other firms and sets itself apart as an optimal solution in its sector by offering a blend of modern and classic elements, resulting in an exceptionally high standard of entertainment. Put differently, this platform presents a broad array of exclusive material, ranging from timeless classical films to the most recent releases, with a mix of accessibility and choices facilitated by digital media technologies. Also, by operating in all four quadrants, Disney+ aims to appeal to virtually all demographics encompassing all key audience profiles. Unlike Netflix, Disney+ releases more child-friendly and family-oriented content. Concurrently, Marvel’s superhero hits and Star Wars-themed series also engage and bring together individuals from diverse backgrounds. Coupled with a cost-effective subscription, the platform’s content renders it highly sought-after for consumers who favor the most convenient form of entertainment for all household members. It is apparent that Hastings and his team should acknowledge the expertise and competitive edges of Disney+; nevertheless, reacting to its progress and engaging in a direct rivalry would be imprudent. Since 2019, numerous entertainment conglomerates and technology titans will join the streaming service sector. Generally, their tactics will involve offering primarily exclusive content and favorable terms regarding pricing – thus, each platform will eventually cultivate its own audience. In this scenario, Netflix should persist as one of the contenders in the market and adhere to its strategies by creating and publicizing its content. Concurrently, it could experiment with fresh methodologies to foster its competitive advantages and distinctive values. I believe that with the advancement of technologies and digital media, the appeal of conventional media is inevitably waning. Netflix was a pioneer in the domain of streaming services, and its supremacy was conspicuous. It is undeniable that the production of content by traditional media enterprises will still be sought after; however, if they aspire to rival Netflix and captivate a broader audience, they should venture into the streaming service arena as well with their unique perks or create other customer benefits. Primarily, the triumph of video streaming hinges on the diversity of content and its availability. In simpler terms, individuals are drawn to streaming services for the chance to select from vast assortments of audiovisual materials suitable for all age groups and view them from various gadgets at a relatively modest cost at any moment and from any location or even without stepping out of home. Additional merits of video streaming encompass the ease of use and user-friendliness, the capacity to control playback and save content, and the access to live events.
