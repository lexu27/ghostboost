In Searching for Alaska, John Green introduces one of the most exceptional coming-of-age novels that investigate deep existential inquiries concerning life, demise, and the significance of life. Green crafts clever, well-drawn characters, brimming with unique idiosyncrasies — to whom he grants the privilege of achieving resolution on their conditions instead of opting for the rather ambiguous happily ever after. In the novel, the topic of death stands out prominently, and a significant portion of the storyline is centered on its occurrences. Death influences the existences of various characters, such as the main characters, Miles, and Alaska. Alaska embodies the exact essence through which death can alter an individual’s life course, as portrayed by her encounter with her mother’s demise, and in more literal terms, by her own passing.

The prevalent analysis of the novel highlights the inevitability of death, and how despite the starkness of this fact, individuals can never truly come to grips with death. Nonetheless, in this composition, a different argument is put forth. While the significance of death in the novel is fully acknowledged, this essay advocates for Green utilizing death as a method rather than an endpoint. Death is employed as a type of midpoint, a signal towards more pressing thematic concerns of this narrative: how to exist and perish. Moreover, it will be contended that the intermediary process between how to exist and how to pass away is another procedure in itself of discovering the significance of life.

Death performs an essential function in this tale, not merely as a philosophical pondering by the author and the characters but also as a midpoint that effectively divides the narrative into before and after. Death propels the narrative as much as it propels the readers in the manner it propels the characters’ actions. The initial death in the narrative, and arguably one from which much of the plot is based or unfolds, is Alaska’s mother’s passing. Alaska witnessed this death and failed to act at that crucial moment, something she perpetually felt remorseful about throughout the remainder of the tale. Thoyyibah affirms that through this encounter, Alaska was burdened with self-condemnation, as she observed her mother perishing on the floor, yet did not endeavor to aid her in any way, and instead resorted to shrieking and weeping (34). This self-condemnation was exacerbated by the reality that her father appeared to blame her for her mother’s death, and she believed he was justified so, “…so I just sat there on the floor with her until my dad arrived home an hour later and he’s yelling ‘Why didn’t you call 911?’” (Green 120). Alaska’s demeanor throughout the narrative can be ascribed to this sense of guilt.

The demise of Alaska’s mother and the events surrounding her passing transform Alaska entirely, not solely herself but the narrative of the lives of those near her. Thoyiba mentions this occurrence as the notable childhood trauma that molded Alaska’s portrayal as a coping mechanism (1). It influences her perspective on life, notably on the process of existing. Alaska adopts a nihilistic approach to life as demonstrated by her interpretation of the metaphor of labyrinth “… It’s not life or death, the labyrinth. /Um, okay. So what is it? /Suffering,” she stated. “Doing wrong and having wrong things happen to you. That’s the problem…” (Green 52). Her passing, whether intentional or accidental, resulted from this impulsive worldview.

Alaska’s passing was the midpoint of the stories of various characters in the narrative and both literal and metaphorical senses of the term. In the literal sense, since Alaska’s demise reinforces the plot, the initial section of the book follows the occurrences of her life, and the subsequent part, the aftermath of her passing. In the metaphorical sense, death serves to instigate a marked change in the other characters and propels the processes of existing and discovering the significance of life. Additionally, the reader benefits from the lessons of this event on the continuation of life after grief and the prospect of overcoming sorrow (Logara 12). One of the most immediate changes in the effects of Alaska’s passing is in prompting other characters to reflect on the nature of death. Takumi and Miles engage in a frank conversation in which they appear to agree on death being natural, notwithstanding a certain sense of dread pervading their discussion. Takumi argues, “It’s natural. I mean, it must be natural” (Green 253). To this, Miles admits to have pondered it previously, asserting that despite its gruesomeness, death was universal.

Aside from contemplation on life and death, another consequence that strongly emerges is the unbridled remorse that seizes those near Alaska. For one reason or another, many characters felt they could have somehow averted this passing. Particularly, the sentiment of guilt compels Miles to probe whether the demise was a suicide — a process through which Miles winds up discovering a lot about himself. A new facet of him filled with love, grief, regret, sorrow, and bitterness gets unveiled, and through this, Miles attains a deeper comprehension of himself by undergoing all these thoughts and sensations.

Despite death occupying a central role as a prevailing theme in the narrative, it is inextricably linked to life and hope on the one hand and how to pass away on the other hand. In the frequently asked questions section of his website, Green addresses this concern by suitably contextualizing the role of death in this narrative. Green asserts that characters typically perish in literature at the commencement or conclusion. Nevertheless, the principal death in the book (that of Alaska) happens in the middle as he intended the readers to meet and form an attachment with Alaska and then lose her (“Looking For Alaska FAQ — John Green”). This, he asserts, would enable them to follow Pudge and Colonel and the rest of the characters in discovering healing. This journey would enable the readers to combat nihilism that could accompany such loss and feelings of futility and find hope amidst unresolved and irresolvable grief. Although an author’s interpretation of their text is by no means superior to a reader’s, a fact Green concedes to, these observations by the author significantly support this essay’s thesis.

This essay argues that despite the instrumental role death plays in the narrative, it is simply mediating. The profundity of death provides suitable material for dialogue about other phenomena of life. This is precisely how Green employs death in the novel. For instance, readers are engaged in a discussion concerning profound societal concerns through the death of Alaska’s mother and the subsequent progression of Alaska. For example, Dunder subjects the book to postfeminist theory analysis and feminist criticism in her study. She posits that Alaska is a “Manic Pixie Dream Girls” character that perpetuates stereotypical gender roles and, consequently helps to maintain a glorified image of the muse (1). For example, Dunder cites Green’s portrayal of Alaska’s body through Miles’s distraction by her “substantial cleavage” (p 53). This, she argues, was Green opting for a stereotypical representation of female attributes in compliance with the patriarchy and society by depicting Alaska as attractive or beautiful in the eyes of Miles.

Such analyses as Dunder’s became widespread, sparking a dialogue among the readers and the general public that the novel remains the most challenging novel of 2015 under the young adult category. The principal concerns
