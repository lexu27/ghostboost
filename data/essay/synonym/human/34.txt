Excellent People from Rural Areas is a brief symbolic tale, penned by Flannery O’Connor, regarding the twofold essence of devout laborers, isolation, and egotism. Certainly, even the roles of the figures have a concealed implication regarding their look, disposition, or existence. The narrative kicks off with the portrayal of two elderly women and their offspring who pertain to two distinct societal strata. Mrs. Freeman serves as a domestic worker in Mrs. Hopewell’s residence, and the latter was depicted as a lady with two main unpleasant facial expressions for the masses. As the tale was recounted from Mrs. Hopewell’s standpoint, she was portrayed as a composed, courteous, and tolerant individual, observing but excusing other people’s imperfections, including her daughter Joy, who opted for the formal moniker Hulga. Their acrimonious cohabitation was disrupted by a 19-year-old attractive gentleman, Manley Pointer, who peddled Scriptures door-to-door and professed to have the same cardiac ailment as Joy but seemed to be a delinquent. Through allegory, O’Connor managed to communicate the distinct attributes of the protagonists with their names, association to progenitors with Hulga’s artificial limb, Joy’s mindset with her spectacles, and Pointer’s irreligiousness with the empty Bible. The initial emblem is the figures’ titles that in part mirror their destinies and temperaments. For instance, the audience is not furnished with the first names of Mrs. Freeman and Mrs. Hopewell. They obtained their surnames from unions, indirectly hinting at the sole role that women could have in the South during that era, suggesting the enforced destiny that is antithetical to their present situation. For instance, Mrs. Freeman is not a servant, but she is not liberated because she is a servant, whereas Mrs. Hopewell is despondent. The women’s dispositions were unveiled in their discussions and their progeny. Both are courteous and view themselves as virtuous individuals who sometimes have to tolerate other people’s impoliteness or unawareness. Mrs. Freeman’s daughters, Glynese and Carramae, red and blond girls, whom Joy linked with Glycerin and Caramel, indicating a lack of respect for their chosen life path (O’Connor 2). Moreover, Joy was never cheerful in actuality; thus, she altered her name to Hulga to fulfill the portrayal of an unattractive individual to shun the traditional path of all Southern women. Specifically, she seemed to aim to evade matrimony and procreation. The subsequent allegorical component in this account was Hulga’s wooden leg. This emblem signifies her incapacity to become autonomous of her mother. Indeed, she still resides with her parent, is out of work, and lacks interactions with other individuals. It emerges that she was born with an inborn cardiac flaw that, optimally, would grant her to live until her forties (O’Connor 5). Nonetheless, Mrs. Hopewell yearned for her daughter to wed at the suitable age. However, an inadvertent gunshot wound at the age of ten became a pivotal juncture in Joy’s life when she was supplied with the wooden leg and evaded the typical destiny of her female contemporaries. Despite a doctorate degree, the young lady did not labor and cohabited with her mother, anticipating her own demise. The arrival of Pointer bestowed her with a slight hope for a fresh existence. However, the girl’s aspirations did not materialize as Hulga was deceived by the youth and forfeited her synthetic limb. Nevertheless, the vanishing of her prosthesis was a metaphor for the chance to detach from the parental abode and commence an adult existence. The third allegorical element of the concise narrative was Hulga’s eyeglasses that Manley filched alongside her wooden leg. Hulga’s eyeglasses are her discernment and capacity to perceive the world clearly, both literally and figuratively. Nevertheless, she was prepared to renounce her convictions for this man. Thus, she allowed him to seize her eyeglasses during the instant of intimacy: “when her glasses got in his way, he took them off her and slipped them into his pocket” (O’Connor 13). Since Pointer absconded, Hulga was bereft of glasses because she could no longer scrutinize the world through the perspective of her former mindset. The fourth emblem was the young man’s valise with two Scriptures. Indeed, one of the Scriptures was an unfilled receptacle for liquor, cards, and contraceptives (O’Connor 15). The vacuous vessel not only epitomized Pointer’s lack of Christian beliefs but was also an allegory for the insincerity of certain devout laborers, who discourse about God and are concurrently embroiled in sinful deeds. Moreover, this illustration and the youth’s altered conduct not only shattered Hulga’s anticipation for an alternative future but also confirmed her atheist convictions. In summation, O’Connor’s Excellent People from Rural Areas embodies the predicaments of the deceitfulness of devout laborers, the challenge of severing from parental oversight, and the fixation of individuals with their integrity and other people’s blemishes. This account exhibited a distressing ordeal of a young woman with feeble health who floundered to construct social bonds despite several college degrees. Four emblematic elements in this brief narrative unveiled Hulga’s odyssey to detachment from her mother and antiquated beliefs. The first was the figures’ titles that delineated their appearance and temperaments. The second was Hulga’s synthetic limb as a mooring to her mother. The third was Hulga spectacles, which the youth snatched from her deftly, becoming the pivotal enabler of disenchantment. The fourth was Pointer’s suitcase with spurious Scriptures as a symbol of the falseness of his devoutness. Overall, the malevolent act of the youth left Hulga in fury and disillusionment but with a more pragmatic perception of the world.
