Romanticism is a comprehensive ideological and artistic movement in the culture and art of the 19th century, which supplanted the cold rationalism of neoclassicism and Enlightenment. Romantics have heightened the significance of imagination, sentiments, emotions, and mental agitation (Steiner & Foster, 2020). The era of heroes with sturdy, daring, conflicting, and sometimes rebellious personalities emerged in literature and art. These are personalities like Byron and Prometheus, who either extol man’s greatness or become helpless in the face of destiny while emotions overwhelm them. They set off on journeys, scale the barricades, hoist the flag of freedom, and are unfamiliar with peace.
Romanticism in painting dismissed the rationality of classicism and mirrored the focus on the depths of the human character characteristic of the philosophy of the Romantics. It matured on the emotional foundation of sentimentality, but while upholding lyricism and poetry, it substituted sentimental sensitivity with dramatic displays of nature. Hence, it is not essential to link this trend with religious motives – rather, with the allure of far-off travels, voyages, enigmatic discoveries, and even revolutionary conflict. Unlike sentimentality, there is no gentleness and tearfulness in Romanticism – it is the philosophy of the courageous and robust.
The figures in the artworks of romantic artists resemble the protagonists of literary novels: receptive, frequently cryptic, at times rebellious, at times harsh, and frequently isolated. Numerous creators were engrossed in investigating the shadowy facets of human nature (Steiner & Foster, 2020). Consequently, there was the fascination of artists with the nighttime, thunderstorms, and mysticism. To some degree, the romantic virtuosos even revisited Baroque aesthetics with its intense drama, fervor, liveliness, disorder, and mysticism.
The primary characteristic of Romanticism as a trend in literature resides in the fundamental conflicts and concepts. The primary concept of nearly every piece is the ceaseless motion of the literary protagonist in physical space. This aspect mirrors the turmoil of the hero’s spirit, his fluid, perpetual musings, and simultaneously, alterations in the surrounding reality.
As in any artistic trend, Romanticism has its conflicts. The entire premise in this trend is grounded on the intricate relationship of the protagonist of the piece with the external world. The central character is self-centered, but at the same time, they resist the crass, low, material elements of reality (Steiner & Foster, 2020). This is illustrated both in the deeds and in the thoughts and concepts of a literary character. The most notable instances are the subsequent figures of Romanticism – Childe Harold, the principal character of Byron’s piece Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage, and Pechorin – the principal character of Lermontov’s piece The Hero of Our Time. Therefore, at the core of any composition in the direction of Romanticism lies the divide between reality and the idealized world, and this divide has quite sharp boundaries.
An illustration of contemporary romanticism is the film “The Perks of Being a Wallflower.” The primary focus is on the 16-year-old boy Charlie, who is enveloped by typical predicaments for his age: school gatherings, trendy companions, relationships, unreciprocated affection, substances, and adolescent despondency. Similar to any romantic figure, Charlie contends with the external reality that he is disinclined to embrace. The chief romantic concept of the movie is that the protagonist is that Charlie matures, and his outlook on the world, encounters, and milieu evolves. Hence, despite the fact that present-day films can scarcely be interpreted from the perspective of romanticism, “The Perks of Being a Wallflower” is a commendable instance of a romantic work of art.
