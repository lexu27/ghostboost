Life by itself is a intricate concept that encompasses many phases, facets, and issues. As an individual progresses through subsequent phases of growth, prior concerns become less significant, allowing space for fresh subjects and worries. In this context, a mid-life dilemma is a substantial event impacting most individuals who arrive at this stage in life. As can be deduced from its title, this crisis arises around a midpoint of an average lifespan when youth is in the past and the latter part of life is approaching. At this juncture, a person is inclined to contemplate their past encounters and ponder their preceding decisions. Once pleasurable pursuits start to diminish in importance, and the future outlook may seem intimidating. Seeking the evasive youth, individuals undergoing a mid-life crisis tend to make debatable choices. Moreover, their personal beliefs shift away from materialistic concerns as they contemplate and debate more refined ideas. This article examines Leo Tolstoy’s My Confession as an example of the internal conflict encountered by a man in his mid-life dilemma. While his faith-based resolutions fulfill these requirements, it is not and cannot be restricted to the Christian faith.
Tolstoy penned My Confession when he was at an age that is presently perceived as “middle”. In this brief composition, the renowned Russian writer ruminates on his literary journey and life occurrences as he ages. By that period, he had already achieved significant success as a maestro of literature, having released several prominent works. However, as he openly acknowledges, most of this work was done to earn a living for him and his family. In other words, Tolstoy’s literary pursuit hinged on materialistic incentives in terms of garnering money and status. Furthermore, his profession was a satisfactory diversion from having to search for significance in life. Authorship consumed a substantial portion of Tolstoy’s time, leaving minimal or no space for contemplating more sophisticated matters. Furthermore, during an era when religion held great importance for Europe, Tolstoy, as a writer, adhered to facts and science. Ultimately, the writer encountered an impending crisis of significance at the metaphorical midpoint in life.
This crisis experienced by Tolstoy stemmed from his focus on literature for a significant portion of his lifespan. In My Confession, it swiftly becomes apparent that writing was neither a passion nor a fate for Tolstoy. Instead, he straightforwardly refers to it as a “waste of time”, confessing that he persisted on this path purely for materialistic reasons (Tolstoy, 2018, p. 7). In other words, he wrote to gain fame and wealth and ultimately achieved this goal. Nonetheless, as Tolstoy surpassed the midpoint of his life, materialistic riches had not guaranteed his complete contentment. He amassed his wealth, and his name became well-known both in Russia and overseas. However, he began to contemplate the futility of this pursuit and the overarching objectives of his authorship. Having secured material contentment, he found his spiritual needs unfulfilled. Thus, Tolstoy encountered a mid-life crisis of significance, realizing what he had accomplished but questioning its worth.
In this manner, the celebrated author found his prior contentment fleeting and even fruitless. Tolstoy ruminated on his sentiments and experiences, eventually concluding that his life lacked a spiritual element. While seeking an efficient remedy to the crisis, he recollected that his past actions were guided by rational knowledge. Tolstoy (2018) deduced that this knowledge provided him with facts but failed to assure the significance of life. Therefore, he sought answers in the so-called irrational domain, which is faith. Tolstoy embraced the principles of Christianity, contemplating the central ideas and of religion on a deeper level. He became convinced that science and logic are inadequate to comprehend life’s intricate, complex, and multi-faceted nature and its significance. Consequently, Tolstoy anticipated religion to draw him closer to the true purpose of life, which was no longer confined to material possessions.
In essence, Leo Tolstoy adopted a strictly theistic stance on this philosophical matter. For him, the solution to the significance of life lay in God’s domain and the teachings of Christian philosophers. Evidently, as an independent, educated individual, he had the right to select this path toward understanding the significance of life. However, the ultimate portrayal of theistic principles as the absolute fount of truth, significance, and satisfaction does not align with the diversity of opinion valued by society. For instance, an atheistic adversary could reasonably argue that, unlike science and facts refuted by Tolstoy, faith is not supported by solid proof. Therefore, this could be a case of wishful thinking that fails to provide genuine significance to life. Instead, its general uncertainty creates space for interpretations, through which a person can draw convenient conclusions that create an artificial sense of satisfaction. Furthermore, the desperate pursuit of religious resolutions to a crisis of significance renders individuals susceptible to the malevolent intentions of those looking to exploit them.
Despite the general controversy concerning the solution advocated by Leo Tolstoy, the very essence of this narrative is stimulating. It is exceedingly beneficial to examine the inner dialogue of a man who confronts a severe crisis of significance by age 50. Furthermore, Tolstoy is a prosperous and renowned individual of his time, indicating that neither money nor status grants immunity to such an eventuality. These notions remain pertinent today, as modern society’s mid-life crisis is a prevalent occurrence. Similar to Tolstoy, many individuals persist in an ongoing pursuit of wealth, status, and success in both their professional and personal lives. Nonetheless, they are equally prone to encountering a severe crisis of significance. In fact, the likelihood of this happening is greater today as the world grows more competitive, intense, and demanding. The current lifestyle, especially in urban areas, prompts ambitious individuals to continuously strive for new heights, consistently raising the bar. Under these conditions, more individuals eventually reassess their past experiences and realize that they still lack fulfillment and significance.
Consequently, the quest for an effective solution to a mid-life crisis of significance is a matter of paramount importance today. For Tolstoy, the solution lay in faith and God, as the ultimate wellspring of spiritual fulfillment, as opposed to materialistic possessions. Today, this perspective retains its significance, as religion is integral to most developed societies. Nonetheless, it seems more fitting to broaden the range of solutions initially introduced by Leo Tolstoy. More specifically, he confines it to the principles of religion and Christianity in particular. It is self-evident that the world’s religions are not confined to this. Moreover, faith is not necessarily linked to traditional religion. Having faith implies that a person harbors strong beliefs that impart meaning and purpose. In addition to God, one can also believe in oneself, their family, interests, friends, and a gamut of noble causes from philanthropy to social activism. Every individual is at liberty to believe in God, but there are other sources of faith in this world. In this context, a mid-life crisis can indeed be addressed through Tolstoy’s solution, although it requires further refinement to be universal.
