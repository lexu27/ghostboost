Numerous nations are evolving into more diverse societies, and physicians are receiving patients from varying socio-cultural backgrounds. Consequently, there is a growing demand for cross-cultural dialogue among individuals. This is particularly crucial in the medical field as individuals converse about subjects concerning healthcare, illnesses, and even preserving life. Successful physician-patient engagement is linked to heightened patient contentment, conformity to advice and results, and enhancing well-being (Purnell, 2002). If the socio-cultural variances between patients and physicians are not examined and implemented, this may result in patient discontent, defiance of advice, and detrimental health effects.
