The influence of a scriptural stewardship viewpoint on the suggested monetary arrangement
The scriptural viewpoint on stewardship assumes that leaders are given authority over other individuals and resources by God (Carradus, Zozimo, & Discua Cruz, 2020). Consequently, they should aim to guarantee the welfare of every individual to respect the Lord. In this context, the present monetary arrangement was devised in a way that would profit all the stakeholders engaged, encompassing healthcare providers of critical patients and advisory staff.
The potential gaps and uncertainties in the project's monetary arrangement
Although the monetary arrangement apparently covers most of the expenses that might arise during the project implementation, there are still some uncertainties that need to be taken into account. Hence, Oâ€™Connell (2020) contends that managers should always contemplate the worst-case scenario and be ready to react appropriately. Concerning the current project, primarily, it is challenging to anticipate the actual demand for mental health services among physicians. This uncertainty impacts the ability to forecast the necessary number of mental health workers. Additionally, likely crises and subsequent inflation rates could trigger a cost hike, necessitating extra funds for acquiring equipment and medicine. Furthermore, the expenditures for services, training, and upkeep might also escalate.
Presumptions that can plug the potential gaps in the project's monetary arrangement
Regarding the initial gap in the monetary arrangement, it can be presumed that there will be an average requirement for mental services among healthcare practitioners. This assumption would help to partially alleviate the risks of the uncertain need for provided services. This is elucidated by the fact that when the expected demand is low but the actual requirement is high, then the patients are largely underserved. Conversely, when expectations are high but the actual demand is low, it results in significant financial losses. Regarding inflation, it is crucial to presume a specific sum of money for unforeseen costs. Consequently, if prices surge, the organization will still be able to cover the planned expenses.
