The US is regarded as a steadfast advocate and advocate for democracy. However, some ethnic minorities, such as Chinese and Native Americans, endured significant discrimination and had to strive for equal rights with white Americans. Despite all the mistreatment, they did not forsake their country during World War II and played a substantial role in the triumph, prompting the government and society to recognize the necessity for cooperation.
The primary contribution of Chinese Americans to WWII was their active recruitment in the US military. According to Takaki (2020), their enthusiastic backing dismantled Japanese propaganda, which depicted Chinese Americans as victims, and led China to align with the US. Despite the harsh circumstances many of them faced and white Americans' bias against them, they utilized the war as an opportunity to establish themselves as devoted patriots.
Regarding the Navajo tribe, they also had grounds to be antagonistic toward white Americans. Nonetheless, they consented to fight as partners to safeguard their nation and people. Their principal contribution was involvement in encrypted communication: Americans employed Navajo's indigenous language as a foundation for it (Takaki, 2020). Consequently, a minor language, which was once prohibited and deemed inferior, evolved into a valuable tool of victory.
It astounds me how much Chinese and Navajo Americans endured discrimination, yet they stood united with white Americans for their nation when the external adversary emerged. Furthermore, the utilization of Navajo's indigenous language during the conflict is genuinely inspiring, as it transformed the US cultural diversity into a weapon. We must not overlook this valuable experience and endorse minor languages and cultural customs.
It is disheartening that migrants or citizens with non-white lineage had to validate their merit before white Americans acknowledged them as equals. Regrettably, the rise of movements like Black Lives Matter indicates that some non-white ethnic groups still encounter discrimination (Garret, 2018). Consequently, new immigrants frequently face ethnic intolerance akin to their forerunners, as their languages and cultural principles are regarded as inferior, or they are deprived of equivalent vocational and educational prospects.
In conclusion, Chinese and Navajo Americans have significantly contributed to safeguarding their nation during WWII and demonstrated their allegiance. Despite the discrimination and mistreatment they faced from white Americans, they extended assistance and showcased the potency of collaboration. The utilization of the indigenous Navajo language also highlighted the importance of cultural diversity. These historical occurrences have imparted valuable lessons that we must retain.
