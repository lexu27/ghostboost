Serotonin is produced from the amino acid tryptophan using two processes akin to converting tyrosine to dopamine. The initial process, which produces 5-hydroxytryptophan, is facilitated by tryptophan hydroxylase, which is situated only in serotonin-producing cells and is the limiting step (Hernández-Hernández et al., 2019). Aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase and 5-hydroxytryptophan decarboxylase speed up the conversion to serotonin. Serotonin production commences by altering L-tryptophan to 5-hydroxytryptophan through the enzyme L-tryptophan hydroxylase, which is present in cytoplasmic and granular brain cell parts. This enzyme is vital for serotonin synthesis in the same manner as norepinephrine and dopamine production. Adrenergic and dopaminergic synapses are governed by the action of a similar enzyme, L-tyrosine hydroxylase, to convert L-tyrosine to L-dihydroxyphenylalanine (Hernández-Hernández et al., 2019). Specific TPH regulators, such as α-propyldopacetamide, also inhibit tyrosine hydroxylase, while others, like p-chlorophenyl alanine, are more targeted towards TPH.

In the alteration of the precursor compound tyrosine to dopamine, the subsequent process unfolds: the rate-limiting biomolecule in catecholamine production is tyrosine hydroxylase (TyrH). Saranya et al. (2021) state that tyrosine hydroxylase stimulates tyrosine’s hydrogenation to L-DOPA. The catecholamines dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine are the components of the chain involved in the peripheral nervous system as endocrine glands (Saranya et al., 2021). Phenylalanine hydroxylase catalyzes the conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine, while tyrosine hydroxylase catalyzes the conversion of tyrosine to L-DOPA (Saranya et al., 2021). Aromatic amino acid deaminase converts DOPA to dopamine.

Finally, the ensuing processes occur in the synthesis of norepinephrine from tyrosine: norepinephrine is the key messenger for postganglionic autonomic ventricular neurons. It is produced within the nerve fiber, stored in vesicles, and then released by the neuron in reaction to the transmission of a signaling cascade down the nerves (Płonka et al., 2022). The provided details, as depicted here, concern the generation of norepinephrine. Initially, tyrosine is transported into the sympathetic nerve ending through the amino acid tyrosine. Subsequently, tyrosine is converted into DOPA by the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase, which is the limiting step in the biosynthesis of norepinephrine (Płonka et al., 2022). Lastly, DOPA is then decarboxylated to form dopamine. Therefore, dopamine is transported into vesicles and altered by dopamine-hydroxylase (DBH) to norepinephrine (NE).
