"Crash Crash Baby" could be classified as a sci-fi musical since it integrates aspects of both categories in a thrilling storyline. Following my initial viewing of the preview, I was taken aback by the lively quality of the music and the personalities in the motion picture. The primary lead in the film is a young woman named Stephy. She envisions herself as a renowned vocalist; nevertheless, her alcoholic father disapproves of her aspirations. The narrative unfolds in 1963 in a minor Canadian village, and additionally, the film bears stylistic similarities to the 1950-1960s period in American pop music (Perone 34). The attire, haircuts, outfits, and adornments all highlight the teddy-boy fashion that was widespread in the 1950s.

Nevertheless, subsequent to viewing the film, it emerged as a sour and disheartening encounter as the topics depicted in the movie are much deeper than they appear in the trailer. Primarily, the director successfully cultivated a surreal and enchanting ambiance by challenging the authenticity of the occurrences through the scenes where Stephy awakens from her reverie. Slumber is utilized as one of the primary transitional mechanisms in the film's screenplay as Stephy is sexually assaulted when she falls asleep. Subsequently, she awakens with Bobby Shore in her residence, and the subsequent time she wakes up in her bed, her entire existence is altered, and she is pregnant with a peculiar infant and engages in intimacy with a man who violated her. Consequently, I believe the movie revolves around Stephy's growth and her sorrowful tale of relinquishing her aspirations of becoming a vocalist due to the harsh external situations.

Furthermore, the movie is brimming with charming conversations and jests, predominantly emanating from the renowned vocalist Bobby Shore. He is a trendy young gentleman who resembles Billie Joe Armstrong and Elvis Presley. He is sharp and suave, yet somehow he comes across as superficial since his motives are unclear. Nevertheless, one of my preferred jests in the film stems from this character when he remarks, "Indeed, individuals adore casinos. They are superb for betting aficionados." It is somber and skeptical, yet it vividly epitomizes the persona of Bobby Holiday.

The melodies in the film play a pivotal role as at every pivotal juncture in the movie, a song commences. One of the most heart-wrenching moments for me was when Stephy sings at the service station upon discovering that all of her aspirations have been shattered and she is living a life with a man she despises. Another noteworthy aspect is the lavender fumes from the chemical factory near the city. Once they materialize, everything in town and Stephy's life turns magical, and when the fumes dissipate, then everything reverts to the melancholic norm. The transformations of the urban inhabitants are grotesque, embodying a dream-like sensation of the movie. The cinematography in the film is also noteworthy as it frequently employs the blending techniques from films of the 1940-1950s era.
