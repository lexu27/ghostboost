For Asia and Asian authorities, World War II had serious consequences. Owing to a shortage of resources, the grand colonial forces from Europe were left feeble and incapable of governing their territories during WWII. They were engrossed in their own problems, and the rise of anti-imperialist feelings domestically hindered the decolonization process. Following the events of WWII, territories were unwilling to undergo colonization again. Subsequent to the conflict, territories that had supported their colonial overlords were granted sovereignty. Instances of nations that reclaimed sovereignty consist of the Philippines from the United States of America in 1946, India from the United Kingdom in 1947, Ceylon and Burma in 1948, and others.
Before WWII, Japan had aspired to extend its control over other nations. The invasion of Manchuria in 1931 signaled the beginning of Japan’s East Asian enlargement, which escalated in 1937 with a lethal campaign on China. Japan became part of the military coalition recognized as the “Axis” when it endorsed the Tripartite Pact with Germany and Italy. The United States enforced economic penalties on Japan to discourage Japanese hostility and compel the withdrawal of Japanese troops from Manchuria and China. Confronted with severe scarcities of oil and other raw materials and driven by a wish to overthrow the United States as the leading force in the Pacific, Japan strategized to attack the United States and British forces in Asia and obtain Southeast Asia’s resources. The modernization of Japan post-WWII genuinely commenced in the 19th century. During this period, the Asian nations embraced the Western culture, enabling them to merge into the global society and foster connections, including economic alliances with other nations beyond Asia.
