Directional methodologies are the vital facets or approaches that steer strategists in making crucial organizational decisions. The main directional tactics encompass vision, purpose, objectives, and principles. Vision declaration forms a mental picture of the organization to the community and the entire public. Conversely, the purpose statement accentuates the organization’s unique rationale or intent for existing in a provided setting and sets it apart from others of its kind. The organization’s range of operations in commodities, amenities, and the market is pinpointed from the purpose statement. Strategic objectives are the outcomes or yardsticks linked with success factors (Ginter et al., 2018). Finally, the organization’s fundamental principles are the essential guiding concepts that influence its culture among its members and stakeholders. Conversely, strategic choices are the intellectual inquisitiveness of assembling, arranging, and evaluating information accompanied by the readiness to be and stay open to innovative thoughts, concepts, and solutions that endure in the long term.
