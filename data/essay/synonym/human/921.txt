Life calamities can prompt an individual to various choices. Some individuals may view these calamities as cautions, while some may regard them as opportunities. The contrast between these two individuals is how they emerge from a calamity. Writers, dramatists, and authors have tried to depict this concept in different literary pieces, chronicling how different characters deal with calamities. Calamities in "Hamlet" and "A Good Man Is Hard to Find" push characters to depend on the alteration as a coping strategy.
"Hamlet" tells the tale of an individual grappling with a loss that leads him into a cycle of emotions. For example, he becomes inert due to the sorrow of losing his father. Such a calamity is sufficient to drive an individual to despair as they attempt to comprehend life without their loved ones. In the drama, Hamlet is illustrated to have relinquished all hope in life and would not allow anyone to console him.
"Oh, that this overly tarnished flesh would dissolve,
Melt, and transform itself into a dew,
Or that the Enduring had not set
His decree against self-destruction! Oh God, God,
How exhausted, insipid, flat, and unproductive
All the uses of this world appear to me!" (Shakespeare, 1599).
This excerpt demonstrates Hamlet's state of despair, which is ascribed to his prior loss. His coping mechanism is apparent in his ongoing mourning months after the demise, which he is eager to concede that he has on him is adequate to conclude the show (Shakespeare, 1599). This implies that he is conscious of his appearance but would not cease mourning. According to him, his sorrow is much more profound than what people may perceive of him. This illustrates how different individuals may respond to a calamity and overlook what others might opine. It also indicates that a calamity might be highly individual for some individuals than for others. For example, Hamlet's mother has remarried, indicating that the demise was not that impactful for her to cease enjoying life.
"A Good Man Is Hard to Find" also presents the account of an individual striving to cope with a calamity. However, this calamity is distinct from Hamlet's as the character is confronted with the calamity of existence. The writer asserts that "The deities reveal to us that there is a necessity for a complete world of anguish to enable the individual to conceive the redemptive vision" (O'Connor, 1953). This statement invokes a Christian belief, a type of solace for many individuals grappling with a calamity. At times people have no other recourse but to rely on a divine entity to address their calamities. Hence, it is accurate to acknowledge that this narrative carries a spiritual significance to life and its tribulations. Calamities are part of life, and one never knows when they will strike. The writer presents a way to cope with a calamity by invoking Christian principles. Sometimes the sole approach is seeking divine aid and making sense of life. The characters in the narrative are enduring various challenges that are not easy to decipher from a simplistic viewpoint but convey the true essence of the narrative.
Calamities deal severe blows to people's lives, guiding them through various changes. Some calamities are too challenging to confront that individuals frequently surrender entirely. Nevertheless, some individuals can emerge from them unharmed and prepared to thrive. "Hamlet" and "A Good Man Is Hard to Find" illustrate two different types of people based on their coping mechanisms. While Hamlet fails to emerge from the calamity, O'Connor's narrative characters lean on God for spiritual guidance. This demonstrates that different individuals have diverse ways of coping with a calamity based on their perception of the calamity itself.
