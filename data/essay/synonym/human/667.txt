Preface
Tradition is, in its essence, a compilation of shared convictions upheld by a community of individuals. Specific actions are considered standard and appropriate by cultural norms, while others are deemed strange or inaccurate (Tombleson et al. 16). In some customs, personal connections and informal agreements are significantly more binding than any contractual duty. Cultural exchange pertains to the utilization of language and other expressive instruments by individuals and communities to conduct their tasks and obligations through symbolic means (Tombleson et al. 21). Local variety impacts every facet of worldwide exchange. Even the mode of interaction selected may carry cultural connotations (Tombleson et al. 22). For example, it has been noted that industrialized nations increasingly rely on computer technologies and place importance on written text over verbal or face-to-face communication.
How Cultural Correspondence Impacts Lockheed Martin’s Executives Worldwide Culture
In particular nations, discord is viewed positively, while others aim to avert it. Although confrontation is not generally endorsed in the United States, individuals are encouraged to settle disputes promptly (Wilce et al. 243). In numerous Eastern nations, it is preferable to resolve conflicts privately. Moreover, regional diversity would influence how Lockheed executives approach tasks. There are several rationales for this, including variations in resource allocation, distinct perceptions of time, and differing stances on how collaboration and task-focused work should coexist. For instance, Asian and Hispanic societies prioritize group processes at the project outset and shift their focus to the end goal as the project progresses (Wilce et al. 243). Conversely, European-American cultures emphasize the immediate task and allow relationships to develop naturally.
Decisions are typically delegated to a subordinate in the United States. Autonomy is highly valued in several Southern European and Latin American cultures. In group settings, popular sovereignty is most effective in the United States, as with Lockheed, while consensus is favored in Japan. Furthermore, some cultures prohibit emotional involvement, the causes of a dispute, or personal details (Ferraro 72). While particular inquiries may seem informal to one person, they may be inappropriate to an individual from another culture. Therefore, Lockheed administrators should recognize this before comprehending the viewpoints and goals of the individuals they engage with. Ultimately, diverse societies hold different perspectives on knowledge acquisition (Ferraro 72). Europeans value information acquired through numbering and quantifying more than data gathered through alternative methods (Ferraro 73). Conversely, certain African cultures place importance on knowledge obtained through symbolism, while specific Asian cultures prioritize knowledge acquired through transcendence.
Logic and emotion both factor into international business transactions. The dominant one determines individuals’ efficacy, their inclination to express emotions, or individuals' emotional detachment (Wilce et al. 241). Citizens of collectivist cultures do not openly display their emotions but rather regulate and suppress them strictly. In high-emotion societies, individuals openly express their feelings by smiling and occasionally weeping or shouting (Wilce et al. 241). Furthermore, some societies view time as a linear commodity that can be saved or wasted. Other cultures perceive time synchronously, as an ongoing flow to be experienced presently and as an uncontrollable force (Wilce et al. 243). Hence, the standpoint of Lockheed’s executives in global interactions with nations having a culture contrary to that of the USA may impact their economic transactions.
Standards
In the Western hemisphere, eye contact communicates assertiveness but may be construed as impolite or forceful in the Middle East and Asia. Additionally, there are gender-specific limitations concerning facial expressions, with numerous Eastern cultures prohibiting women from maintaining eye contact with men as it signifies authority or physical closeness (Lee et al. 112). Touch is commonly employed in conversations, particularly in business environments, as exemplified by conventions like handshakes. Nonetheless, other societies view physical contact with others as impolite. Asians exhibit more conservatism in embracing, with a bow frequently substituting for a handshake (Lee et al. 112). Lockheed’s culture is more conservative, such as refraining from cheek pecks, as prevalent in many European regions. Consequently, Lockheed’s global transactions in Asia may be influenced by such norms as their executives may misinterpret their Asian counterparts.
Irrespective of an individual's location globally, the general principle here is to provide people with more space than they believe they require and only approach if requested. Physical proximity is perceived diversely by individuals from various cultures. Nonetheless, it is advisable to refrain from encroaching on anyone's personal space, around 2 feet (Odine 55). Certain regions of the United States are content with complete serenity, while others take offense at the exposure of a bare forearm or leg (Odine 55). The prudent course of action is to dress appropriately. Hence, when transitioning to regions where the dress code disapproves of casual attire, Lockheed’s staff must dress suitably; otherwise, no business dealings will prosper. Additionally, one may adjust their attire if it becomes apparent that doing so is acceptable.
