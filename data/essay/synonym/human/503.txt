Preface
The ambiguous language of the current Intermountain Healthcare (IH) description of PC leads to inadequate explanation of specific nursing duties such as quality of patient life, caregiver support, and non-discriminatory patient treatment. A comprehensive PC policy has not been embraced in the IH facilities, leaving care teams to develop an individualized approach to each terminal patient, which might be ineffective and lead to substandard service. Nationwide, many healthcare providers (HCPs) lack expertise and skills in pain and symptom control, communication, and care coordination, while the public has only a vague comprehension of the advantages of PC and how to obtain them (Meier et al., 2017). Given the diverse range of responsibilities in delivering palliative care (PC) and the absence of specific guidance, IH healthcare providers (HCPs) who only fulfill primary orders such as medical prescriptions may inadvertently overlook certain care components. Thus, an informative PC policy is essential to promote successful delivery and guarantee fair access to care services in the IH facilities.
Existing Policy
Due to the absence of an established PC policy, most particulars were gathered from yearly reports and public website sections. Palliative care in IH facilities aims for several objectives: quality of patient life, symptom alleviation, family and caregiver assistance, and a collaborative approach to care and care tailored to patients’ goals (Intermountain Healthcare, 2018). However, the primary current objective is for HCPs to concentrate on managing pain and other symptoms like queasiness or sleep problems (Intermountain Healthcare, 2020b). None of the mentioned components are thoroughly explained, including the primary objective. Intermountain Healthcare (2022) nursing services for end-of-life care involve symptom evaluation, “skilled services and treatments,” and situational management. Along with nursing care, patients and their families can anticipate the care team to address counseling, emotional and spiritual support, medication and supplies, domestic aide services, and home care during acute necessity (Intermountain Healthcare, 2022). The specifics are to be tackled in a plan of care (POC), collaboratively formulated by the care team and the patient based on the diagnosis, symptoms, and other requirements (Intermountain Healthcare, 2022). However, it is uncertain what ‘skilled services’ involve or how detailed POCs are.
Literature Review
Scholars in medical and legal research advocate for the formulation of detailed palliative care policies. Supporting this initiative, IH devised a hospital-based electronic palliative care algorithm to enhance the identification of patients benefiting from PC services and compute PC penetration rates (Gruhler et al., 2018). The algorithm then revealed that the necessity for receiving PC could be as high as 26.4% of the total IH inpatient population (Gruhler et al., 2018). It will progressively become more challenging for HCPs to devise personalized care plans for IH patients with such high and potentially escalating numbers. Consequently, an approach with broad universal applicability is required to meet this demand.
Moreover, the policy emphasis should be on restructuring service delivery holistically. Palmryd et al. (2021) discovered that nurses caring for intensive care unit patients did not prioritize integrity, contending that more explicit guidelines are necessary to rectify the issue. This concern may pertain to the IH facilities, given that current IH guidance on PC does not specify the expectations and duties of each party. Hence, the research necessitates a policy alteration to facilitate effective communication between providers and patients.
Additionally, the absence of a universal, comprehensive PC creates an opportunity for bias. An eye-opening discovery was that the quality of end-of-life care for patients might hinge on the illness the patient is afflicted with (Martinsson et al., 2018). Simultaneously, Spraker-Perlman et al. (2019) determined that IH patients lacking known critical conditions (CC) benefit significantly from PC support before their demise just as much as patients without CC. Consequently, the research demands ensuring that the non-discriminatory approach to PC provision is stipulated in the policy.
Lastly, attributing negligence to IH nurses is unreasonable, given their incapacity to assist at times. The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has illustrated that the dearth of resources and nursing exhaustion contribute to the heightened negligence in PC (Human Rights Watch, 2021). In its Annual Report (2020a), IH acknowledged that its caregivers focused on establishing personal protective equipment (PPE) assembly lines, with their routine duties witnessing a substantial reduction in hours due to the pandemic. This circumstance necessitates ensuring that nurses can fulfill the care requisites. Thus, the policy to enhance patient care should involve reevaluating the caregiver support system, as nurses’ workload can impede the quality and quantity of services rendered.
Discussion Outline
A meticulous evaluation of contributing factors, strategic objectives, and budgetary plan will be necessary to develop and execute the policy successfully. The policy should guarantee equitable distribution of responsibilities and maintain a suitable standard of accountability for non-compliance. It should furnish an adequate level of detail in each aspect and institute enforcement mechanisms to prevent routine duties from suffering due to negligence. Moreover, ample staffing in every establishment is imperative to prevent situations where IH staff is overwhelmed with dual responsibilities. Overall, the proposed approach should establish clear and explicit guidelines governing nursing staff responsibilities in end-of-life care, a comprehensive support network for HCPs and patients, and specific cases of accountability.
Demographics
The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted that therapeutic care currently takes precedence in provider-patient interaction over any PC aspect. During an acute crisis, numerous IH staff members were dispatched to aid in New York hospitals (Intermountain Healthcare, 2020a). The crisis may have subsided, but the issue of which duties should take precedence lingers, which could be burdensome for the IH facilities staff. Therefore, the primary demographic that policy alterations can influence will be nursing staff necessitating clear guidance on responsibilities and expectations. Additionally, the inpatient population of the IH facilities will be encountering the repercussions of the altered PC regimen.
Morbidity and Mortality Rates
Neglecting the matter of inadequate PC may significantly impact mortality rates. Gruhler et al. (2018) estimate that 90 million Americans are presently living with serious, life-threatening ailments and anticipate the number to double within 25 years. There is compelling evidence of PC diminishing acute unplanned hospitalizations, and specialized PC services linked with enhanced short- and long-term care outcomes (Sleeman et al., 2021). Hence, refining the policy approach to specialist palliative care would ameliorate patient outcomes.
Disparities Arising from the Current Policy
The underappreciated role of end-of-life care in the present policy contributes to unequal access to care. Although PC is increasingly acknowledged as a fundamental right, the absence of support guidelines and research impedes many from availing it (Sleeman et al., 2021). Specifically, there are two drawbacks stemming from IH policy reliance on individual POCs in facilitating end-of-life and palliative care. Firstly, individualized POCs imply that no universal standard of conduct is established; coupled with a potentially limited patient comprehension of the services they may necessitate, this could lead to subpar performance. Secondly, Intermountain Healthcare’s (2022) policy stipulates
