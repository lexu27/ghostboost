As a worldwide corporation, Walmart must contemplate various methods of entering domestic markets. The emergence of any new entities is complicated by the already saturated status of most markets. Nevertheless, Walmart benefits from being one of the globe's largest firms, which provides it with influence when stepping into a new market. Simultaneously, even Walmart is not immune to local specifics. Nuances in regulations, financial and economic circumstances, and even cultural relativism can counterbalance the efforts of new participants. Hence, utilizing the same approach for every market is myopic. I support Walmart's choice to penetrate domestic markets through diverse ownership structures.
A partnership is a type of ownership that involves dividing risks and expenses among parent companies. Companies employ this tactic when the risk of independently entering the market (for instance, using a wholly owned subsidiary) is excessive. This instability is especially prevalent in developing markets, like India. Despite being a growing economy, there are risks associated with taxes, bureaucracy, and cultural misinterpretation. Hence, collaborating with a local conglomerate Bharti Enterprises was a risk mitigation measure for Walmart. It should also be mentioned that this particular collaboration was ultimately terminated by Walmart purchasing Bharti’s shares; it did facilitate the former’s entry into the market.
A comparable scenario can be witnessed in South Africa, where local Massmart vended over fifty percent of its shares to Walmart. Once again, a similar tactic is employed: spreading risks by teaming up with a local company to access a high-growth market. It should also be noted that unlike in India, Walmart acquired the majority share (51%). Essentially, it permits the company to make all major decisions in South Africa while entrusting day-to-day operations to Massmart, thereby taking advantage of local conditions.
Walmart’s tactic in Mexico mirrored the one in South Africa – it formed a partnership with CIFRA. Subsequently, Walmart obtained a majority stake in CIFRA and proceeded to rebrand it as Walmart de Mexico, which continues to function under this name. Expanding into Mexico was less risky than would later be the case with India since Mexico is nearer to the United States both geographically and economically. The most crucial risk was anti-monopoly regulations, which posed a threat to Walmart’s strategy of lower prices; nevertheless, as Walmart did not purchase 100 percent of the shares, the ones that remained were owned by local partners who can function within the Mexican legal framework.
The United Kingdom differs in that it is a saturated developed economy. Entering it was more demanding than an emerging market. The rationale behind Walmart acquiring the majority of Asda was its availability. If Walmart had not procured the majority, it would have been bought by another company. Consequently, Walmart could make all decisions independently without considering a partner's requirements.
Nonetheless, it should also be mentioned that Walmart ultimately divested the majority of its shares. Consequently, it seems that entering a foreign market should be conducted with a partnering company, even if it involves sharing profits. In India, South Africa, and Mexico, Walmart retains the majority, whereas in the UK, it is now scarcely present. Therefore, a partnership is the most feasible choice for entering and remaining in a foreign market.
