The exploration indicates that making it illegal for expectant mothers who utilize or abuse substances is detrimental to both them and their unborn offspring. It highlights the repercussions of regulations that punish expecting mothers who use substances rather than offering sufficient therapy or assistance (Thomas et al., 2018). The discoveries propose that criminalizing pregnant women for substance use is ineffective and harmful as it can lead to negative health effects for mothers and infants (Weber et al., 2021). Additionally, the rules are often biased, and strategies for reducing harm aid in ensuring that expectant mothers receive the care they require.

This is one of the rationales why criminalizing substance use by expectant mothers is damaging to both mothers and infants. Expectant mothers who use substances may be scared of being apprehended, detained, or incarcerated if they seek prenatal care or substance abuse treatment. Moreover, criminalizing a woman’s conduct during pregnancy violates her essential rights, particularly her right to privacy and equal protection under the law (Carroll et al., 2021). It argues that it encroaches on a woman’s liberty to reproduce and physical well-being. It punishes women who wish to continue their pregnancy and encourages them to evade criminal consequences by terminating their pregnancy. Consequently, it is crucial to acknowledge that specific regulations may endorse abortion (Carroll et al., 2021). Additionally, it discriminates against women in general as it does not penalize fathers who partake in conduct that could endanger an unborn child.
