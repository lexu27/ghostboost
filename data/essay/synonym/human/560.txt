My 73-year-old father extracts his deteriorating teeth himself because he cannot afford to visit the dentist and have them extracted professionally. He is ashamed to smile, experiences discomfort, and cannot chew effectively. Dreadful to envision that it will only deteriorate and unlikely improve. Regrettably, my father is not isolated: dental problems are prevalent among seniors. Oral pain is an indication of profound cavities infecting blood vessels and nerves in the teeth. In 2020, over 40% of grown-ups reported having undergone discomfort in their mouth. Absence of dental care coverage, affordability, and accessibility for seniors is a profoundly disturbing subject, and notwithstanding being emphasized and talked about on the governmental level, no resolutions are enforced.
Incredibly, a governmental insurance plan is not designed to aid seniors battling with dental problems. Since its establishment in 1965, Medicare has left out regular dental care, preventive dental services, and rehabilitative dental procedures coverage. Medicare doesn’t involve dental care coverage, and financial support is restricted. Expenses related to dental treatment are extraordinary: millions of dollars are presently being expended on oral health issues in the emergency room, and the vast majority of such patients are seniors. The Kaiser Family Foundation conducted a research in 2019 and revealed that 65%, almost two-thirds, of all Medicare beneficiaries didn’t possess any dental coverage. The Journal of the American Medical Association also stated that during 2017, about 70% of seniors faced difficulties with their teeth and couldn’t consume properly, yet refrained from visiting the dentist. The same report indicated that almost half of the aged Americans stated that the main reason for avoiding an appointment with a dentist is the cost.
A recent American College of Emergency Physicians report highlights that America encounters over 151 million emergency department visits annually. 96% of non-traumatic dental emergencies result from abscesses and caries. Many emergency department visits stem from individuals who lack access to dental care providers or cannot afford a primary dentist.
One of the notable recent legislative initiatives for dental services to be incorporated into Medicare is the proposed Medicare extension by President Biden. The proposal encompasses integrating dental, hearing, and vision coverages to Medicare. Even though both Republicans and Democrats endorsed the proposal, republicans appeared hesitant since they anticipated it would raise the costs to be borne. Thus, individuals desire the dental coverage to be included in Medicare but are reluctant to be the ones to cover it. The most significant issue is that there has not been remarkable progress in the proposal; hence the nation is unsure when or if the proposal will be executed.
Dental coverage for Medicare beneficiaries is crucial not just for oral health but also for overall health. Dental care inaccessibility is a pressing issue that necessitates attention and immediate solutions. One in ten dental care beneficiaries currently expends more than $2,000 out of pocket, while one in five expends more than $1,000. The spending expenses are likely to escalate as the population ages, and the oral health of elderly individuals will deteriorate even further. Several studies indicate significant barriers for older adults in obtaining dental services, including the high costs. There is a critical need to invest in the dental Medicaid program to prevent burdening seniors with paying for it.
Dental coverage aside, Medicare has been awaiting expansion as Medicare beneficiaries utilize about 39% of their out-of-pocket health expenditures on services Medicare does not cover. Since many individuals lack supplementary insurances to cover the additional services, they utilize their personal funds to pay for them. Roughly half the states don’t provide denture coverage but only offer emergency dental care. It is important to note that coverage does not ensure access. For example, only a few participants presently partake due to the low Medicaid payment rate. Broadening Medicaid on service coverage could resolve cost obstacles and unmet needs facing low-income Medicare beneficiaries. The more the expansion of Medicaid to reach all poverty levels, the more challenging it would be to the current environment.
In conclusion, I believe that if we don’t devote ourselves to resolving these issues, our aging population will undoubtedly be visiting the emergency room more frequently, and we will all be paying more for it. I don’t know when or if my father will ever have the privilege of going to a dentist to repair his throbbing teeth. Our older generation does not merit to endure mouth pain, and policy adjustments should be contemplated as rapidly as possible.
