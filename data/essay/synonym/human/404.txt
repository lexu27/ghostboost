The tale of Monarch Uruk, or Gilgamesh, is widely acknowledged as the initial recognized elucidation of the connection between humans and deities. In essence, The Epic of Gilgamesh is the primary reference to folklore in our realm. To be more precise, the key emphasis of the composition is on Monarch Uruk’s metamorphosis from a dreadful sovereign to a benevolent one when he is compelled to confront mortality.
As mentioned, the central figure of this narrative is the Monarch of Uruk, who now acts as a symbol that in former eras, humans used to experience the same emotions as we currently do. According to Anneberg Learner (2021), this manuscript predates the Bible since it is "four thousand years old in its earliest form." Consequently, The Epic of Gilgamesh portrays the existence of Uruk’s ruler, primarily above all other monarchs, considering that he was extraordinary, "he was two-thirds divine and one-third human" (Anneberg Learner, 2021). Nonetheless, when the deities realized that they could not tolerate such a conceited ruler, they dispatched Gilgamesh’s counterpart, Enkidu. Ultimately, the Monarch of Uruk comprehended the importance of social engagement, "remarkable about being involved with another human being" (Anneberg Learner, 2021). It is noteworthy that Enkidu actually commenced in the same manner as Adam and, subsequently, was humanized by the harlot dispatched by the deities. Nonetheless, one fatal error of Enkidu and Gilgamesh results in the former’s unavoidable demise, and when the Monarch of Uruk acknowledges that his comrade is deceased, he embarks on the quest for immortality.
In general, the principal concept of the story is that the deities fashioned eternal life solely for themselves, whereas humans will always be pursued by demise. Eventually, as Gilgamesh's opportunity to exist eternally was pilfered by a serpent, he ultimately realized his wealth, comprehending the past and the capacity to revert back to his metropolis. At the conclusion of the narrative, the metropolis outlasts its ruler, which is why such a potent message has persisted in the human memory ever since.
