Marx’s hypothesis on the idolization of goods focuses on society’s inclination to place significance on goods based on contributed work, which inevitably leads to the dominance of the products over individuals. Additionally, the idolization influences the social interactions between the consumer and manufacturer: the esteemed items are autonomously traded for the respective intentions. Such trades of items occur independently of human requirements or choices (Ritzer, 2011). In this scenario, it is crucial to highlight that the term fetishism does not imply any sexual implications; it solely describes people’s tendency to commit themselves to the mentioned principles.
In contemporary society, we have idealized technological trends in the same manner that Marx’s hypothesis indicates. For instance, Apple products are recognized to be greatly valued for their “top-notch” and “user-friendliness”. The labor invested in producing the products, although at times viewed as unethical, enhances the brand’s overall reputation. As numerous workers dedicate hours and efforts to manufacture the goods, their worth escalates regardless of their quality. The item’s worth is then heavily reliant on the significance attributed by the general populace and promotional tactics rather than its inherent value. Furthermore, the workers essential for the brand’s triumph also transform into goods, as stated in the Manifesto of the Communist Party (Marx & Engels, 1818-1883). Consequently, although existing distinctly from one another, all fundamental components of the contemporary socio-economic structure become detached from their genuine value.
Marx’s hypothesis neglects to investigate how a good acquires its value solely from the quantity of labor integrated into the procedure. This could be depicted as a crucial flaw of the hypothesis, as it overlooks a fundamental aspect that contributes to altering the materialistic principles of society. Another aspect that was not addressed in Marx’s writing is linked to the essence of goods, why certain ones are more esteemed than others. Nonetheless, the Manifesto of the Communist Party and Marx’s hypothesis establish a sturdy groundwork for examining contemporary socio-economic interactions.
