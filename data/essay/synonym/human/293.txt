The lifestyle of South Sudan truly values bulls as essential; they are used in various ceremonies and slaughtered to support the whole family. Grey Bull is a movie that reflects the cultural significance of the bull to South Sudanese people. Grey Bull, written and directed by Eddie Bell, is a brief film of approximately 15 minutes that explores the conflict between Martin, a South Sudanese man, and the proprietor of his cows’ abattoir.
The origins of Bell’s narrative harken back to the 1800s when another newcomer to Australian shores was envisioning himself in the pages of history books. “The primary aspect of an idea was that I wanted to create a modern Ned Kelly tale,” the video director reveals in a conversation with Short of the Week.
Grey Bull showcases some bold creations, but it is the power of the plot and the performances that truly captured many viewers’ attention. It is easy to understand why director Bell gained acclaim for such a confident film. At a time when migration is a contentious issue globally, it is refreshing to encounter a narrative revolving around a migrant that genuinely appears to offer a positive perspective on such a journey.
A story about leaving your past behind to focus on your future. Grey Bull is a film that encourages its audience to adopt the viewpoint of its main character and raises several important questions about displacement.
The film lacks heroes or elaborate plots, making it solely about a man character crisis. Yet, somehow, the simplicity of the visuals and subtlety of the themes make it enjoyable to watch and compelling enough to revisit. The visuals are stunning to convey the more straightforward narrative. Each scene in this short film is smoothly and purposefully filmed with the viewer's intent in mind.
Every shot is framed and well-lit, often highlighting the precise element with perfect timing, offering a path to visual guidance, where the video director will deliberately position focus and emphasis on a specific setting, object, subject, or abstract point to convey a message or emotion in the scene.
The color palette used in the film is crisp, excellent, and pleasing to the eye; no explosions or filters are necessary – every frame of this short movie is gratifying to watch. Apart from the cinematography, Grey Bull brings a texture to the entire performance, a belief, and an atmosphere that deeply impacts the audience's emotions during the viewing.
The atmosphere or lighting plays a crucial role in each shot, often making the otherwise serene and subdued film even more gloomy and laborious. However, this does not undermine the movie; it makes the situation even more realistic and compelling. This is effectively built up by the tense and somewhat awkward narrative of reconciling and assimilating conflicts with the living.
The film avoids clichés and presents a truthful and coherent biography of a man filled with internal turmoil and compelled to choose between his past or future life. Grey Bull follows the standard short film format: introduce the character, the conflict, and the theme of the story, and let it unfold in a straightforward manner. It is concise and compact while also culminating with the typical conclusion of a short film being somewhat enigmatic or open-ended.
The initial three-quarters of the film’s duration that pertains to the primary and straightforward telling of the story before the climax is captivating and somewhat soothing while still maintaining the tense, uneasy atmosphere that tends to be tranquil at times. However, specific points disrupt the calm and contribute to a renewed sense of conflict that grabs the audience's attention once more, all leading to a final unexpected and jolting conclusion.
The ending, somewhat cryptic and open-ended, serves as a clever way of engaging the audience in analyzing the film. It prompts them to speculate and ponder on how and why the film concluded in that particular manner – which is clever and leads to a movie that can be discussed for years.
Overall, the film earns a solid 9/10 rating making it imperfect, as no film ever truly is, yet it comes remarkably close to perfection. Grey Bull is a movie that can be viewed by anyone regardless of the audience, age, culture, or educational backgrounds. I recommend everyone to watch the movie wholeheartedly, contemplate it, and give it a significant amount of consideration. Grey Bull offers a captivating and unique story-driven experience that captivates the minds and emotions of its viewers while simultaneously drawing them closer and farther away to a concise conclusion, allowing them to process and formulate their theories that ultimately make the film all the more engaging.
