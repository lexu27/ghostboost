The Balboa is Panama’s national money, named after Spanish explorer Vasco Nez de Balboa, who came across the Pacific Ocean. One Balboa represents one U.S. Dollar, and the U.S. Dollar has been lawfully swapped in Panama since then. Consequently, Panama is seen as a highly inflationary nation; nonetheless, Panama can benefit from the U.S. dollar’s resilience as the cornerstone of the world banking markets. For instance, this suggests that Panama will not confront hyperinflation as a result of shifting exchange rates. Thus, Panama has turned into a more appealing investment and tourist spot. Nonetheless, a dollarized system has exceptional inflation performances and might even mitigate the impact of global trust shocks but not genuine external upsets (Bakari & Mabrouki, 2017). Moreover, it is uncertain whether Panama’s lenient monetary policy arose from the dollarization system or the competing, increasingly globalized banking sector.
Panama’s geographical location as a crucial maritime route adds to the importance of the Agreement. Roughly two-thirds of the Panama Canal’s annual passages are destined to or from U.S. locations (Park et al., 2020). Virtually all U.S. automotive and commercial goods shipments to Panama will be duty-free initially, with remaining tariffs phased out over a ten-year duration (Park et al., 2020). Information systems equipment, agriculture, large machinery, aircraft and parts, healthcare and environmental measurement, green products, drugs, fertilizer, and agrochemicals are among the U.S. items that will profit from immediate duty-free access. The U.S. and Panama trade crops like maize and bananas when discussing exports and imports.
