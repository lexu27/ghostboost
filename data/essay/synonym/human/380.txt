This manuscript is dedicated to the exploration of judgmental prediction. It includes generic information about this form of prediction, instances of its use, illustrations of its most efficient application, and its pros and cons. As an illustration of judgmental prediction, the Delphi technique is suggested, which entails recognizing a consistent evaluation of an expert assembly through an autonomous, unidentified survey of professionals in several rounds, which involves disclosing the outcomes of the preceding round to the professionals. Resources such as the book Forecasting: Principles and practice by Hyndman and Athanasopoulos, and Sniezekâ€™s article "A comparison of techniques for judgmental prediction by groups with common information" are utilized to back up the presented information.

What is Judgmental Prediction
In situations of the extreme intricacy of the dilemma, its novelty, inadequacy of accessible information, or the impracticality of mathematical formalization of the resolution procedure, one has to refer to capable professionals. The resolution of dilemmas by professionals, their commentary, the formulation of quantitative assessments, and the processing of the latter by formal methods is termed the technique of judgmental prediction. Hyndman and Athanasopoulos (2018) affirm that this technique involves a set of rational procedures aimed at acquiring from professionals the data essential for the preparation and selection of sensible resolutions. In the theoretical aspect, the legitimacy of utilizing judgmental prediction is confirmed because methodologically accurately obtained professional judgments fulfill two criteria for the reliability of any fresh knowledge: precision and replicability of the outcome. Consequently, judgmental prediction is devised by experts based on their expertise and evaluations.

Judgmental prediction aids in formalizing the procedures for gathering, consolidating, and analyzing professional viewpoints to convert them into the most convenient form for making a well-informed decision. Furthermore, this technique of prediction is consistently developed and enhanced. Currently, judgmental prediction, combined with other mathematical and statistical methods, can decrease the risk of making an erroneous decision.

Where is Judgmental Prediction used Most Efficiently?
According to Hyndman and Athanasopoulos (2018), judgmental prediction is employed in particular situations. Initially, when an entity or some phenomenon cannot be described mathematically. Secondly, it is utilized when there is no dependable, precise, statistical information about the entity that allows the use of objective methods. Thirdly, when there are no resources for mathematical processing. For instance, if there is no computational equipment, software, or qualified personnel. Fourth, it is a suitable technique for an urgent scenario when a prompt decision is necessary. Thus, there are four primary situations in which judgmental prediction is used.

Illustrations of how Judgmental Prediction is Used Most Efficiently
One instance of the most efficient utilization of judgmental prediction may be the instance of central banks. Hyndman and Athanasopoulos (2018) mention that they include judgment in predicting the present level of economic activity, a process recognized as nowcasting because GDP data is only accessible quarterly. Furthermore, this form of prediction model is particularly advantageous in fields such as research and development. Focus groups and expert assemblies can offer information that no computational model can provide. For example, by inquiring a group of individuals about what they are seeking in a product, companies can assess their direction in developing specific product characteristics.

Merits and Drawbacks of Judgmental Prediction
Like any other occurrence, judgmental prediction has both advantages and disadvantages.

Merits
The indisputable benefit of judgmental prediction is that it is all-encompassing and relevant to various forecasting objects. Furthermore, it is relatively straightforward from a methodological perspective and does not impose high requirements on the quality of the initial fundamental information. Sniezek (1990) indicates that the range of statistical forecasting methods is limited to short- and medium-term forecasts. Conversely, judgmental prediction will facilitate making long-term forecasts.
