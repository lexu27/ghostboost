It is no astonishment to anyone that professional athletics is inseparable from monumental physical and mental challenges. Prominent athletes across fields have voiced out on how excruciating training, ongoing lifestyle restrictions, social seclusion, and an unavoidable race against time have impacted their mental well-being during and after their sports careers. Most of these challenges are, to some extent, inevitable, but an unattainable standard of never-ending stamina that athletes have to confront outside of practice and tournaments has certainly made them even more difficult. The New York Times article Simone Biles Rejects a Long Tradition of Stoicism in Sports (2021) discusses the standard and the way American gymnast Simone Biles opposed it during the Summer Olympic Games 2020. It delves into the tense and intricate issue of emotional susceptibility in major sports and the price of such vulnerability.
Right at the start, the article acknowledges the cultural change toward acknowledgment of mental struggles both generally and specifically in athletes. An athlete of Simone Biles’ caliber a decade ago, or even five years ago, might have been reluctant to confess that she grappled with pressure, let alone withdraw in the midst of an Olympic competition. Simone’s choice to quit the largest international event in the sports world has made her an emblematic figure of the relevant yet uneasy conversation. Success in sports, as well as in numerous other domains, is impracticable without self-control and willingness to strive. Yet, at what point is deemed a respectable moment to pause and allow oneself to recuperate? After her pivotal decision, Simone has encountered online criticism with allegations of lack of patriotism and strength of character. Hence, it is evident that for many individuals the ultimate outcome remains considerably more crucial than the mental wellness of an athlete. Such a framework, however, is an almost definite formula for an eventual catastrophe, a burn-out, or even worse, that could have been averted if one’s mental requirements had been taken seriously early enough.
The article proceeds to recount the remarks of Sian Beilock, the president of Barnard College, who studies the interplay between external pressures and the psyches of athletes and business individuals. According to Beilock, the increasing readiness of athletes to speak out demonstrates that mental health matters affect everyone. Biles, Osaka, and others’ candid admissions are, according to Beilock, crucial in the ongoing effort to destigmatize the issues of mental health (Longam, 2021). If a renowned and successful athlete can undergo anxiety, depression, and wrestle with pressure in general, then ordinary people should not place impractical expectations on themselves.
It can be devastating for an athlete to perform poorly at the most awaited and public moment of their career. Consequently, acknowledging the pressure and taking a step back might be a wise decision not only in the moment but for the long-term trajectory of an athlete’s ongoing journey in their chosen sport. Sustainable lasting success and consistent performance are only feasible when an individual recognizes and embraces their boundaries. There is no disgrace in seeking the assistance of others, just as there is valor in acknowledging the reality and adjusting current actions. Ultimately, unnecessary endurance does not necessarily mirror greater determination within tournaments. As each person possesses their resources, it is crucial to utilize them in optimal ways without neglecting the fundamental needs of the human mind.
