"The Passing of Conventional Societies" is grounded on empirical material acquired from fieldwork and interviews carried out over a decade in Turkey, Lebanon, Syria, Egypt, Jordan, and Iran. Lerner proceeded from the truth that in the process of modernization, all societies shift in the same direction, which was determined by the Western nations that had finished modernization earlier. However, this "Western model," as per Lerner, is essentially global. It gained its name only because of a historical convergence of circumstances. Nations of the North Atlantic were the first to execute the processes of secularization, urbanization, and industrialization. Examining the modernization of lifestyles based on empirical material, Lerner gives the most attention to the growth of population mobility, the dissemination of literacy, and the mass media.
For instance, Lerner focused on the issue of constraints for modernization. Among the most crucial factors obstructing development, he linked ethnocentrism. Lerner asserts, "From the West came the stimuli that weakened traditional society in the Middle East; for the reconstruction of a modern society that will function effectively" (Lerner 47). The writer contrasts societies, simultaneously stating that the emphasis on cultural identity hampers progress.
I am of the opinion that this notion of modernization crafted to tackle the issues of transition from "backwardness" to "modernity" was a distinct product of the era following the Second World War. Constructed on numerous simplifications, the modernization theory interprets the historical process as one-line and non-alternative (Dunmire 23). The paradigm proposed by Lerner does not clarify the development principles of many nations, such as China, Russia, or Cuba, and thus forfeits its relevance in contemporary times.
