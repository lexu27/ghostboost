Paraphrase
It occurred many years in the past
In the realm of the coastal land:
There resided the one known as,
Named Annabelle Lee
I cherished, was cherished, we cherished together,
This was the sole way we could exist.
And, breathing affection, we were both juveniles
In the realm of the coastal land.
Yet we adored beyond the typical love,
Me and sweet Annabelle Lee
And, observing us, the celestial being of paradise
Could not pardon us that adoration.
That is why it transpired long ago
In the realm of the coastal land,
From above, the breeze blew cold from the clouds,
He exhaled on Annabelle Lee;
And the relatives of a distinguished assembly gathered
And they took her away from me
To eternally place her in a tomb,
In the realm of the coastal land.
The heavenly being in paradise could not
Know half such ecstasy –
That is why it transpired (as everyone knows
In the realm of the coastal land) –
The breeze blew cold from the clouds at night
And ended the life of my Annabelle Lee.
Nevertheless, loving, we cherished more and fuller
Those who bore the burden of old age –
Those who have exceeded us in sagacity –
And neither the heavenly beings nor the entities of darkness,
Could never part
Could not part my spirit from that of
Enthralling Annabelle Lee.
And always a beam of the moon brings me dreams
Regarding captivating Annabelle Lee:
And the star will illuminate, I always see the eyes of
Enthralling Annabelle Lee;
And throughout twinkling nights, I am all with her, I am all with her,
With the unforgettable – with the bride – with my love –
I am stretched out beside her,
In the tomb of the coastal land.
