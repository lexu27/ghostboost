Organizational framework is a crucial concept that unites the team to effectively manage the goal. Five structural arrangements assist individuals in attaining team objectives. Depending on the group's goals, it is crucial to select the suitable framework. For instance, there are variations: Sole Manager, Dual Authority, Basic Hierarchy, Round Network, and All-Channel Network. These frameworks differ in their essence, and it is important to analyze each of the five to identify the most efficient framework for the team to achieve its goals.
Sole Manager framework is a scenario where the leader assigns responsibilities to all individuals. This framework is traditional, and many companies implement it because of its simplicity and clarity. Indeed, it can have some significant drawbacks, such as sluggish communication, delays, and singular decision-making. The second framework is Dual Authority, where two persons have the authority to oversee the group of individuals. Information passes through these individuals and decreases a manager's control level. This framework helps to save time, but the additional layer might impede communication.
Basic Hierarchy is another traditional framework that proposes a middle manager reporting to the manager. In this situation, the manager is accountable for communicating with other team members through the intermediary. This choice restricts access to authority; indeed, it is more efficient than the previous Dual Authority framework. Round Network proposes the information flow from one team member to another; each person can contribute to or modify the process. This structural arrangement could facilitate communication, as each group member interacts directly with only two other team members. There is no manager, and each group member bears equal responsibility. Nonetheless, one feeble link in the chain can disrupt the entire process.
The final structural arrangement is the All-Channel Network, which revolves around interdependence and the engagement of every team member in the process. All-Channel Network embodies numerous connections where each person relies on one another. It emphasizes diversity and equal responsibilities; nevertheless, decisions can lead to confusion and additional deliberation with other team members. It might also decelerate the process due to multiple viewpoints on the same matter. This configuration is often likened to football and basketball, where the outcome hinges on every team member.
As an educator, I am part of three teams. The initial one is the Sole Manager configuration, where I am responsible for the principal. The educator must report to the principal, and the complete authority rests with the principal's regulations. The second framework is the Basic Hierarchy, where I connect my pupils and the principal. The ultimate configuration is All-Channel Network, where educators establish communication to attain the educational goal. The most efficient structural arrangement was All-Channel Network; despite some drawbacks, the decision was made swiftly. Moreover, this configuration permits diverse viewpoints and amalgamates multiple ideas into one great decision.
A distinct configuration significantly impacts the process; as observed, the speed and simplicity of the decision-making process hinge on the chosen configuration. For instance, when an immediate decision is required, the Sole Manager configuration might be a questionable resolution. Alternatively, multiple team members will achieve the goal more rapidly and effectively. Generally, many educational institutions strive to provide equal capabilities to each team member; this fosters a welcoming ambiance and bolsters the exchange of ideas within the group.
