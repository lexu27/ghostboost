An extraterrestrial incursion is a well-known storyline in the literature, but Ndedi Okorafor enhances it with some crucial particulars. In his Lagoon, the writer selects Lagos, one of the most densely inhabited global metropolises, as a hub of invasion. Specifically, the arrival of extraterrestrials commences at Bar Beach, which is depicted as a site of blending (Okorafor, 2014). This declaration suggests that the world is abundant in juxtaposition, and one condition can promptly transition into another. For instance, Okorafor (2014) notes that sand combined with the ocean, while the underprivileged mixed with the affluent. This data discloses that the tale will concentrate on a transformation. The specified subject is also examined in the prologue to Chapter 1, but the addition of Bar Beach to communicate this message is a less explicit but still noteworthy approach to accomplish it.
Ayodele is an extraterrestrial that arrives on Earth to initiate contact, and the writer depends on particular methods to portray the character. Particularly, the emphasis is on how Adaora reacts to the extraterrestrial’s presence to demonstrate what Ayodele signifies. As per Okorafor (2014), Adaora encountered both appealing and repulsive sentiments while conversing with the extraterrestrial. On one side, this data implies that Ayodele is a humanoid character, and this trait is captivating to others. Conversely, the extraterrestrial possesses an idealistic appearance and exaggerated behaviors, and these realities lead people to believe that something is amiss with Ayodele. It appears that Okorafor (2014) has chosen to render the specified character paradoxical, and Adaora’s response to her presence unveils this reality. Consequently, such a conflicting depiction of the extraterrestrial is crucial to communicate that it is uncertain what to anticipate from this being.
Another critical point pertains to an individual area that is exemplified by Adaora’s laboratory. The author presents an elaborate depiction of this site that the character utilizes to scrutinize the extraterrestrial tissue (Okorafor, 2014). It can be inferred that Adaora frequently spends ample time in her laboratory. It must be acknowledged that such a personal space is a common attribute of numerous scientists, engineers, and designers depicted in other fictional works. According to Gil (2018), a laboratory can symbolize a condition in which a character conducts a philosophical experiment with variables to evaluate unfamiliar phenomena or occurrences. Hence, numerous science fiction narratives equip their protagonists with such environments where they can execute their experiments and make pivotal choices. This data illustrates that the literary piece being examined harmonizes seamlessly with other compositions within the same category.
Lastly, Chapter 7 features the phrase “we are altered,” and the writer adeptly elucidates the essence of the genre through these terms. Every science fiction composition hinges on the notion that technological progress could alter the lifestyle. For instance, temporal displacement, boundless biological engineering, extraterrestrial existence, and others might be feasible if individuals devoted substantial time and effort to enhance their knowledge and competencies. Okorafor’s Lagoon is not an exemption from this compilation given that sophisticated technologies facilitated extraterrestrial incursion. Consequently, it can be stated that the current literary work is in sync with myriad other texts that embody science fiction. All these details indicate that Okorafor enhanced her creation with both the characteristics that are customary for the genre and distinct elements that render the novel distinctive.
