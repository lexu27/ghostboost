Affection is not merely an emotion but a intricate physiological process that takes place in the human body and encompasses various mechanisms. The section "Biochemistry of affection" by Carter & Porges offers an understanding into the biological foundation of affection and relationship. The fundamental ideas investigated in the section involve the function of oxytocin and vasopressin in the establishment of emotional bonds.

Group behavior is part of the process of evolution, and it can be observed among the most primitive species. Simultaneously, the social behaviors of humans are more varied, and affection is only one of the potential forms. Nonetheless, the sensation of affection encountered by individuals still commences in the central part of the human brain, which perceives certain feelings conveyed by the vagus nerve. On the biochemical level, neuropeptides oxytocin and vasopressin assume significant roles. For example, oxytocin is a hormone accountable for reinforcing a enduring bond between a mother and her child (Carter & Porges, 2022). Nevertheless, other adults also can undergo an increase in oxytocin when they witness a newborn, and this circumstance can contribute to their eagerness to partake in caregiving. Furthermore, oxytocin facilitates eye contact and social awareness, which are fundamental components of affection.

Studies reveal that oxytocin is not the sole hormone contributing to a loving relationship since it generally functions together with vasopressin. The latter is a neuropeptide that coordinates hostility and protective behavior; thus, by collaborating with oxytocin, they establish a balance. For instance, oxytocin, which can diminish stress, aids children in enduring distress linked to the separation from their mothers, thereby promoting their well-being.

The other two remarkable ideas delineated in the section are the influence of affection on the child's development and the variances associated with early-life encounters. Males are especially receptive to early distressing encounters, which can result in elevated levels of vasopressin in the body that can render them more aggressive. Essentially, adverse encounters, encompassing the lack of affection, can sabotage the well-being of individuals on the genetic level. Additionally, men typically often tend to undergo higher levels of vasopressin in situations involving a danger.

At the same time, oxytocin exposure during early life phases fosters a person's capacity to love others and establish social connections. Moreover, social interaction is crucial for upholding oxytocin at an appropriate level since seclusion leads to an escalation in vasopressin. Ultimately, the stress-alleviating capability of oxytocin empowers it to govern people's well-being, for example, by expediting tissue mending. Recent studies also underscore the reality that oxytocin can also enhance people's resilience to distressing occurrences (Sharma et al., 2020). After perusing the chapter, I now grasp the fundamental mechanisms involved in social bonding on the hormonal level. I believe it is vital that individuals persist in examining the effects of oxytocin and vasopressin on the human body. Specifically, added research on the influence of hormones on mental health would be advantageous for the formulation of new medication for individuals subjected to distressing encounters.

Carter & Porges, in the section "Biochemistry of affection," illustrate how human interactions and affection are interwoven with the oxytocin and vasopressin hormones. The former actively engages in the establishment of social bonds and diminishes the impact of stress, and contributes to the capability of individuals to undergo affection. The latter is accountable for protective hostility and is more prevalent among men, which causes them to be more predisposed to trauma and experience disruptions on the genetic level.
