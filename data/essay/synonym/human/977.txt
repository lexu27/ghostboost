America is a vast continent, where presently, a large number of various nationalities and representatives of different races, genders, sexual orientations, and ethnic groups reside. Hence, diversity is a crucial component of American society as it plays a significant role in the connections between individuals and impacts their communication. I had numerous interactions with individuals who embody diversity in my daily life. This has influenced me as an individual and contributed to the principles and perspectives towards prejudice that I hold today.
I recollect that when I commenced attending school, my family and I relocated to a neighborhood where the predominant community of our neighbors consisted of black individuals. Many of my classmates were also African Americans, which initially surprised me as a child who had never been in a setting with a group of people who initially appear so dissimilar to me. Nevertheless, even at that point, I sensed that our appearance was the sole distinction. Over time, I encountered many fascinating and compassionate individuals from various backgrounds. That encounter taught me that an individual's character is not determined by the shade of their skin, ethnic origins, or nationality. I am appreciative that I comprehended this at an early stage in my life.
As an individual who opposes prejudice, it is disheartening to witness how individuals may distance themselves from individuals from minority communities solely based on their skin tone, ethnicity, or other attributes that distinguish them. I view such conduct as rather unjust, and I believe that individuals who perpetuate discrimination in contemporary society should be more receptive and educate themselves on the subject of diversity and impartiality.
