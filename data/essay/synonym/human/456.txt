Osteoarthritis is a condition that impacts individuals worldwide, yet is often mishandled within the healthcare system. It is one of the most frequent reasons for disability in elderly individuals, leading to discomfort, decrease of function, and a reduced quality of life. On a societal scale, the disorder is projected to incur $303 billion in medical expenses and lost salaries annually (Abramoff & Caldera, 2020). This persistent, severe condition necessitates ongoing endeavors to reduce its occurrence, discomfort, and decrease of function.
Osteoarthritis is recognized for its deteriorating impacts on articular cartilage, which deteriorates considerably over time. The sleek cartilage at the extremities of lengthy bones and within the intervertebral discs is termed articular cartilage. It offers a low-friction joint surface while having the capability to transmit substantial loads. Although the collagen in cartilage has an extended half-life, it mends slowly, if at all, even with minor injuries. While the cartilage changes the most, the complete joint, encompassing the synovium, joint ligaments, and subchondral bone, is influenced.
Osteoarthritis is frequently disregarded, despite its notable personal, financial, and societal burdens. Even though osteoarthritis frequently coexists with heart disease, diabetes, and mental health problems, and can exacerbate the morbidity and mortality connected with these conditions, it is not encompassed in global strategic schemes for noncommunicable diseases. Patients and healthcare providers may be impacted by therapeutic nihilism, with misunderstandings that osteoarthritis is an inevitable aspect of aging and that there are no effective treatments (Abramoff & Caldera, 2020). Those affected are frequently misinformed about treatment choices. Present healthcare methods can range from neglecting crucial therapies like physical activity, weight reduction, and education to utilizing expensive, unproven drugs for advanced-stage illness. I consider this matter to be the most intriguing, albeit regrettable, aspect of both the article and the perception of the condition. I am convinced that rehabilitation counseling could merge physical and psychological assistance to support individuals with osteoarthritis and its diverse repercussions.
