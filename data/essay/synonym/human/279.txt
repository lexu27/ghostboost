Sex Stereotypes and Bias
Presently, gender clichés and sexual bias force individuals to face different challenges that could result in adverse outcomes. For example, Sandberg (2010) examines why males attain top positions in the labor force more frequently than females. In her speech, Sandberg tackles this issue by presenting current data on the male and female employment disparity, indicating that it is significantly more demanding for women to decide between personal life and professional success. Overall, the Ted Talk is deeply perceptive, giving viewers an opportunity to contemplate contemporary gender inequality challenges. In this Ted Talk, Sandberg also poses a query about the adjustments needed to rectify the current imbalance in the proportion of men and women achieving career excellence. From my standpoint, this is a crucial matter, and I aim to explore the options for addressing it.
One of the most crucial causes of inequality relates to gender variances entrenched in society. Brown et al. (2022) deliberate the so-called gender norms, which are "disparities in how males and females are expected to behave" (para. 9). Such a phenomenon should not exist originally because males and females might assume there is a specific scenario they should adhere to while navigating their lives. Consequently, this matter is particularly significant for me, as I firmly believe that every individual is at liberty to select their course in life despite their gender. However, I am acquainted with several individuals who argue that females should devote more time at home performing household chores while males should labor more and earn money for the household. Hence, my query for the group is: how can society change the current perspectives on gender norms to advance equality?

A mistaken comprehension of gender distinctions has led to even more pressing concerns, like gender clichés, bias, and sexual harassment. These occurrences are exceedingly prevalent today, and many individuals are compelled to endure these adverse incidents in adolescence. For instance, Brown et al. (2022) noted that most adolescents endure unwelcome physical contact and diverse jests, becoming targets of sexual harassment and bias even before completing high school. I am convinced that such conditions can detrimentally impact individuals' psychological well-being and future prospects, and society should allocate more attention to how gender stereotypes and bias affect persons.
