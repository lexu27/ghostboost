When numerous individuals have an opportunity to interact simultaneously, particularly in educational environments, it can readily result in the emergence of conflicts and disputes. The chatty or pessimistic participants undeniably influence the ambiance within the group (Jacobs et al., 2016). It appears that "the exhibitionist" could adversely affect the spirits of all the participants, given that it is simple to become annoyed by such a form of conduct (Jacobs et al., 2016). Furthermore, exhibitionists' objective is to impress individuals around them, particularly a team leader, and to do so, they usually choose to speak incessantly or brag, which diverts the attention of other participants. It is a prevalent concern in group environments as these individuals seek to draw attention to themselves because they may feel insecure or lacking in self-assurance. This is why the exhibitionists tend to respond to all the queries, even those not aimed at them. Additionally, they can capture a leader's focus by posing irrelevant or off-topic inquiries.
In reality, ceaseless speaking could be a barrier to establishing a productive learning environment since, eventually, individuals will become vexed and not have gained any valuable knowledge during the session. The continual engagement of the exhibitionists in the educational procedure is likely to irritate other participants to the extent that they will develop animosity towards such conduct (Forsyth, 2019). Moreover, the exhibitionists can effortlessly impede the group from achieving the established objective by diverting them with their antics and excessive involvement in the entire process. In general, such participants can undermine the group's efficiency and efficacy in learning as they strive to capture all the spotlight without affording other people the chance to realize their potentials within the contexts.
