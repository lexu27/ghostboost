In 2020, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2020-05, which postponed the effective dates of Topic 606 and Topic 842 by one year. This update provided private companies with a much-needed respite, which was overshadowed by numerous challenges linked to combating the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite many companies having embraced the new revenue recognition policy, both preparers and auditors encountered significant difficulties implementing the new accounting standards in practice. The primary issue was that the new standard, contrary to GAAP, does not offer adequate specifics on the application rules. Instead, it offers a theoretical foundation akin to all sectors, which leaves the specifics open to interpretation.
There are various concerns related to revenue recognition that private companies encounter in all sectors. Initially, Topic 606 necessitates revenues to be logged when or as the company fulfills a performance commitment, which prohibits companies from recognizing costs immediately. Secondly, there was a notable challenge with variable consideration, as contractors had to pinpoint the most probable result and adjust the contract's value. Before the implementation of Topic 606, it was impossible to acknowledge revenues based on a claim. Lastly, the quantity of obligatory disclosures surged significantly.
Even though the majority of businesses are prepared to accept the new regulations regarding leases, there are certain issues connected to Topic 842. These issues involve recognizing embedded leases, ensuring the precision of all lease-related data, and standardizing procedures concerning new leases, extensions, and alterations to enable all departments to obtain the necessary information promptly. Additionally, akin to alterations in revenue recognition, modifications in policies concerning leases now mandate increased disclosures, potentially influencing investors' decision-making.
