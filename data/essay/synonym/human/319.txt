With the extensive use of digital technology, electronic mail has obtained particular significance. Through email, communication has become significantly simpler, as individuals have been able to interact with colleagues, family members, significant others, and business associates and representatives of organizations, practically in real-time, bypassing all the challenges of “physical” communication. Nevertheless, what is intriguing is an examination of the degree to which such communication has been altered with the emergence of the phenomenon of email.
In the realm of interpersonal communication, two impacts should be emphasized. Initially, email has significantly expanded the range of communication so that communication is no longer solely conducted in the physical world but can also be effortlessly sustained online. This has transformed the understanding of interpersonal communication and greatly facilitated the accessibility of communication. Meanwhile, email has altered the interpretation of nonverbal communication via emotions and body language, as in written correspondence, particularly in a professional context, such forms of speech are irrelevant (Smith, n.d.). Naturally, there are substitutes in the shape of emoji and stickers, but in emails, typically, such formats are seldom utilized, unlike in messaging applications. From these characteristics, a crucial benefit of email is underscored, specifically enhanced accessibility, the potential for virtually unlimited communication, and maintaining connections with individuals continuously. Nonetheless, there are also drawbacks: reliance on Internet devices, the necessity for an electronic gadget, and any cybersecurity apprehensions.
It is simple to commit errors in digital correspondence, as individuals instinctively attempt to apply real-world communication abilities to the digital realm. These errors encompass neglecting the nature of the recipient and absence of digital manners, confusing writing styles, and transmitting lengthy, disorganized messages (CNBC, 2018). To prevent making these errors in everyday correspondence, it is recommended to grasp the regulations of electronic etiquette, assess your messages before dispatching them, the suitability of utilizing slang and manner for specific recipients, and condensing the message to the minimum length that retains significance.
