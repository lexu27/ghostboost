The rapidly evolving situation in the market of products and services compels organizations to adjust efficiently and promptly. It leads to excessively swift changes within the enterprise without a seamless transition. The swift pace is becoming an issue for both the company and employees. Team members are compelled to swiftly adjust to new work formats, promptly acquire new skills, and take on additional roles. In such circumstances, competent and high-quality change management and decision-making are vital.
In an era of global transformation, change management has become one of the key success factors for most companies. The surrounding reality is in a state of continuous change: the requirements of internal and external customers are evolving, new market obstacles and opportunities are emerging, unforeseen risks are happening. Companies that cannot keep up with the pace of progress and adjust to new conditions often have to exit the market, yielding to more adaptable organizations. The primary concern is that for most employees, swift change induces a sense of unease and dissatisfaction. It frequently leads to extended sick days, absences, constant grievances, and staff turnover. People are worried about their positions, an uncertain future, and ever-growing competition (Anastasiou, 2020). The situation can be worsened by the incapacity to master new technologies, the absence of high-quality communication, and an unhealthy work environment that adversely impacts overall advancement.
The decision-making process can be demanding, particularly in times of crisis. The crisis is a severe external element that significantly impacts the quality of decisions. Many individuals do not possess adequate personal experience or psycho-emotional resilience to make a clear decision and assume full responsibility. Incorrect decisions can be grounded on numerous internal and external mistakes. Internal elements are linked to the character of the decision-maker. They could aid in overcoming anxiety and conducting efficient brainstorming. External elements are associated with decision-making circumstances and external influences. Such decisions may be constrained in time, efficiency, or resources, depending on other employees or the role of an executor (Anastasiou, 2020). All the aforementioned factors have the potential to disrupt the decision-making process.
