The drama "Barriers" by American dramatist August Wilson was released in 1987. This drama revolves around an elderly scavenger Troy, a basketball champion in his youth. It is important to note that "Barriers" addresses numerous crucial themes that are pertinent in today's society. For instance, the initial scene showcases the obligations and duties of fathers and sons. There are multiple understandings of "Barriers," encompassing staged and filmed adaptations, and it is crucial to discuss both to grasp their characteristics.
The viewer witnesses James Earl Jones portraying a stringent father figure. His son, Lyons, is attempting to determine if his father harbors affection for him, which forms a core element of this scene. It is essential to mention that each of the three renditions, film, stage production, and written text, is distinct, and the audience interprets it uniquely. For example, Lyons, the son, inquires about Troy's love for him. Indeed, he does not receive the anticipated response. Instead of declaring his love, Troy elucidates the essence of paternal duty. "It is my obligation to look after you" is a powerful statement that illustrates another form of paternal affection (Niko Papastefanou, 2011). The excerpt from the drama portrays Troy almost wrathful; presumably, he is unacquainted with tender emotions, but he comprehends how to shoulder his family responsibilities.
The 2016 film "Barriers" presents the same sequence, but it is perceived differently. Here, the conversation between Troy and Lyons is prolonged, enabling a deeper insight into the characters. Additionally, the set design is more authentic than the theatrical version, establishing a sense of presence. The significance of finances is also underscored here as a critical theme (H Moga, 2017). It underlines Troy's duty to provide for his family.
On the whole, the theatrical rendition appears to be more impactful and poignant. The absence of elaborate set designs directs the audience's attention to the actors' performance, emphasizing the details. James Earl Jones delivers a remarkable portrayal of Troy with his intonation and facial expressions. Furthermore, when perusing the written text, one might perceive Troy as a neglectful father. Nonetheless, through visualized portrayals, Troy emerges as an embodiment of a strict yet accountable individual. In essence, the essence of this scene lies in the intricacies of father-son relationships; more broadly, the drama delves into acceptance and the capacity to adjust to circumstances.
