Synopsis
Currently, opioids are the most frequently utilized substance in the United States. For an extended period, opiates have been employed as efficient pain relievers, but their calming impacts began prompting individuals to misuse them recreationally. Opioids induce a powerful sensation of euphoria, leading to the peril of using recreational agents. Addicted individuals possess a continual urge to escalate the dosage, which poses a grave medical and societal issue. The United States is confronting one of the most severe narcotic calamities in history. Over fifty percent of fatalities are linked to prescription opioids: heroin and fentanyl (Coon et al., 2022). The figure has surged nationwide amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. The emergency has assumed immense proportions and evolved into a hindrance to the economy and a menace to national security.
Treatment Options Accessible to those Enduring Opioid Dependency
The most efficient method to surmount opioid dependency is acknowledged as "substitution therapy". This method entails utilizing a substance with less addictive potential as a lawful substitute for heroin and other immensely addictive substances. Three compounds are presently sanctioned for substitution therapy: methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone (Volkow et al., 2014). Medications are prescribed cautiously to prevent undesired psychoactive consequences. For instance, a notable drawback of methadone is its capacity to incite a potent withdrawal syndrome upon cessation of its usage. To ease the patient's state, physicians may resort to additional aid with sedatives, antidepressants, antipsychotics, and non-opioid pain relievers. Moreover, physicians extensively employ symptomatic therapy and supportive treatment (Volkow et al., 2014). During the acute withdrawal phase, the patient must remain under continual medical observation.
Assisting a Companion or a Family Member with an Opioid Dependency
The primary element of the treatment incentive is the family. It is imperative to help a person foster a genuine aspiration to combat for survival. Rehabilitation facilities persist as a viable opportunity for an addicted individual to revert to a wholesome, drug-free life. They implement a distinct rehabilitation regimen that enables one not solely to conquer addiction but to embrace a healthy lifestyle and recognize its significance (Brown, 2018). To provide effective encouragement, the psychiatrist must acquire all the essential information about the addicted individual. This will necessitate the aid of relatives and acquaintances who can elaborate on the psychological ambiance, the patients' routines, interests, and familial bonds.
