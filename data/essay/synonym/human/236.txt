The revision in the initial episode of the sequence Money Heist aligns with its exciting storyline and swift action. In the opening scene, as the persona prepares to leave her vehicle, the revision is swift, concentrating on the objects she is collecting. Similarly, the camera frequently zooms in on items, guiding the audience towards the objects that will play a crucial role in the story. For instance, one can observe the ringing phone before it is answered. Additionally, the series employs speedy revision with close-ups and the incorporation of items that define characters – firearms, cash, and other objects that reveal one’s intentions or their distinctive characteristic.
The characters’ close-ups are lively, often utilizing dolly shots to gradually reveal the backdrop or travel with the character. In this manner, the camera remains in motion as long as the characters are in motion or the entire space is unveiled. When they pause, the editing is as swift as the exchange between individuals. During soliloquies, the dolly is reintroduced to maintain the suspense as the series demands a grave atmosphere in numerous scenes involving life-or-death circumstances. Notably, the character in a close-up is seldom positioned at the center of the screen. The frame is divided vertically into thirds – and the characters are positioned in the first or last part.
Hand-held shots are also employed, and they correspond with sequences where characters feel uncertain, confrontational, fearful, or vulnerable. Furthermore, when the characters are moving, the camera progresses at the same pace. The transition from steady dolly movements to hand-held "shaky" shots is essential to contrast moments centered on activity and interpersonal conflicts. Additionally, suspense serves as the primary conduit of sentiment, and the editing maintains ample tension by featuring close-ups of characters rather than an overview of the entire space.
