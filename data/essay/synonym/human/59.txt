Bjurström, Erling and Hylland, Ole M. (Editors). (2018). Aesthetics and Politics: A Nordic Perspective on How Cultural Policy Negotiates the Agency of Music and Arts. Springer International Publishing.
This scholarly work attempts to discover the primary sources of rock as a culture. The editors refer to the ancient Nordic society, examining their way of life, emotions, and personality. Musical instruments and the role of music as a sphere of art in the life of the common man are looked at individually. As a result, the researchers reach the conclusion that it is impossible to pinpoint the sole source of the genre, but it is worth considering the entire society as a whole. This, in turn, indicates that rock can be seen as a global phenomenon, as various parts of the world in one way or another originated rock themes and melodies. Hence, the authors stress that the genre should be seen as a distinct stage in the development of art, not solely in the realm of music.

The authors of this book conduct a global and extensive study of the role of rock themes and specific musical instruments in the life of primitive societies. Furthermore, the writers observe the cultural traits of the natives and Indians, as well as African tribes, highlighting rock music as a means of connecting with God. This leads to the conclusion that the religious significance in rock culture serves as one of the fundamental reasons for the emergence of an entire movement. Lastly, it is important to note the pervasiveness of the analyzed genre, which elucidates not just the popularity of rock, but also the entire lifestyle linked to it. An essential addition is the identification by researchers of the most popular and initial melodies by sounds and notes, and the recognition of a close association with ancient cultures. The study concludes that rock has its own distinct laws and regulations for execution, which trace back over a millennium.

This book is not an exploration of the genre itself, but a manual on the methodology of researching rock. The authors compare and contrast the tools employed to investigate this domain of music. It is acknowledged that this genre does not require examination as a separate sphere of art, but conversely, it can seek connections and correlations. Additionally, a significant point made by the authors is the coherence and unity of all art. This is primarily demonstrated in the fact that the emotion conveyed by rock can be observed in other subsystems. Consequently, only an objective, investigative, and multifaceted approach can yield the correct outcomes.

This article delves into the phenomenon of the appeal of rock music across the globe. The authors are confident that the association of the genre with emotions and individuals stems from the ancient history of civilization. One of the studies included in the article was the examination of wooden and subsequently electric musical instruments. The authors deduced that the selection of both the material and the pitch of the sound of such instruments is not random but is designed to communicate with God, nature, and the public about the most pressing issues. This approach forms the basis of the study, where rock music is viewed as a distinct language of self-expression and cultural context.

This book explores the connection between culture and rock as a music genre. It is noteworthy that the authors use the fundamental sounds of English culture as a foundation for examination and consider their incorporation into the genre. Consequently, the authors conclude that rock is not so much a relatively recent trend in art and culture as a collective representation of different eras. Finally, the book presents theory and analysis of the origins of rock music and its progression. This aids in comprehending the reasons and crucial aspects of the entire process, as well as unveiling the relationship of the scrutinized genre with global culture.
