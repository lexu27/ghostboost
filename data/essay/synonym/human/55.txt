Preface
In a communal environment, individuals communicate with each other and their environment. They utilize words while engaging with other individuals. Language plays a vital role in all societies that utilize it as it facilitates interaction with others, especially in communication. People in their society necessitate a language for communication with one another. Some cultures use monikers for names, while others permit individuals to have multiple words. A name is entangled in footing as it evokes and enacts specific social roles and relationships among individuals (Goffman, 1981). Those with multiple identities can acquire them in diverse ways and patterns over time. Every nation had a national language as an identity or characteristic to differentiate itself from others, so everyone globally spoke their language. Kiesling asserts that naming can be an addressing term, discourse, or stance marker (Kiesling, 2004). In today's society, there is a broad array of languages frequently employed by some persons or groups in their everyday discussions, and jargon is a form of language (Rymes, 1996). This article aims to explore and converse about the jargon term 'bro.'

Approaches to Data Collection
Self-report questionnaires, observational data, and media usage were the primary data collection techniques utilized in this research. In observational data, the researcher monitored the use of the term 'bro' within 24 hours, contexts of usage, and the individuals addressed using the term. In the self-report survey, I interviewed five other users of the term 'bro' utilizing a survey adapted from Kiesling's Dude article (Kiesling, 2004). In media usage, the term 'bro' was scrutinized by the researcher in three media formats, and the researcher documented the instances of its usage.

Discoveries
Observational Data
While discussing going to the shopping center at a friend's residence with the friend and her sibling, I employed the term 'bro' about three times. At home, I used the expression 'bro' twice when conversing with my sibling about driving me to school. I refrained from using the term in front of my parents. I utilized 'bro' three times while messaging and conversing on the phone with a friend about bread and jesting. When my sibling engaged in video games at home, I overheard him utter 'bro.' My two siblings once utilized the term 'bro' in a dialogue at home when the elder sibling was urging the younger sibling to complete the dishes. I employed 'bro' four times while discussing the workload I had for my other classes. I used 'bro' colloquially once when deliberating our research with a friend in my senior seminar class. I also muttered 'bro' to myself once while preparing for a presentation for a research project, but I abstained from using 'bro' in the mosque.

Self-Report Survey
The initial survey was with a 52 years old Caucasian Arab female who is a physician. She never utilizes the term 'bro,' and she is unlikely to address anyone through this term. She believed that adolescents frequently use the term 'bro.' The second self-report survey was with a 22 years old Egyptian Arab female who was a student. She mentioned she uses the term 'bro' numerous times daily. According to her, she is prone to address an intimate friend and sibling, both male and female, using the term. She is unlikely to use the term when addressing a romantic partner, a stranger, an acquaintance, a superior, or a professor. She could also employ the term 'bro' when addressing her parents. She noted she typically uses this term when irritated or trying to address someone humorously. When irritated, she might use the term to soften her tone, and when being humorous, she addresses her close friends utilizing the word 'bro.' She opined that humorous individuals or those who employ slang to address each other use the term 'bro' frequently.
Another survey was with a 25 years old Arab male who is a physician. He mentioned he uses 'bro' numerous times daily, and he is inclined to use it when addressing a close male friend, a male associate, and a male sibling. He refrained from using it when addressing a female stranger, parents, a superior, and a professor. He utilizes 'bro' moderately when addressing a male stranger and a female sibling. He expounded that he uses the term 'bro' because it is a universally utilized and comprehended term that can function as an identifier for anyone. He believed young adults and adolescents use 'bro' frequently. The subsequent survey was with a 22 years old Asian female who is a student. She employed the term 'bro' approximately once a week. She was inclined to address an intimate friend, romantic partner, and a male sibling using the term 'bro.' According to her, anyone who is laid-back, relaxed, and amiable could use 'bro' frequently.
The final survey was with a 24 years Egyptian female who is employed as a clinical research assistant. She used 'bro' numerous times daily. This participant is likely to address both male and female close friends, siblings, and parents using 'bro' and uses the term 'bro' because it is convenient to address close individuals. She stated 'bro' is informal, and instead of addressing the individual by their name, she might say bro. According to her, 'bro' is sometimes a transitional word. She believed an individual below 40 years and someone acquainted with English slang uses 'bro' frequently.

Media Formats
I referenced a YouTube video and two articles in this study. From a YouTube video, US President Barack Obama proclaimed that the term “Bro” signifies indispensable partner when alluding to UK Prime Minister David Cameron (The New York Times, 2015). The US President employed 'bro' while addressing the UK Prime Minister, his intimate friend, and his work colleague. In an article by Rolling Stone, Snoop Dogg, a distinguished rapper, also utilized 'bro' while expressing regret to his fellow Eminem. “I Was Wrong, Bro. “We love each other,” “We’re brothers, man” (Hiatt, 2021). In an article in The Globe and Mail, the bro became prominent as a social type due to ‘How I Met Your Mother’s womanizing’ by Barney Stinson, and society has struggled to comprehend him (Mcginn, 2015). ‘Bro’ denotes a male friend or a male sibling. This article elaborates on how society has grappled with the term ‘bro’ and sports ‘bros,’ money ‘bros,’ fraternity ‘bros,’ and other categories of ‘bros’ exist today, prompting discussions on what a ‘bro is.’

Data Examination
According to the discoveries, individuals employ 'bro' in specific situations. As per the outcomes, people predominantly use it at school with peers and at home with siblings and friends. In the results, individuals employ 'bro' to address and initiate a casual and relaxed conversation (Kiesling 2004). They primarily utilize this term while interacting with individuals from the same age group, predominantly under 30 years. From the observational data, 'bro' was predominantly used with friends who were peers and natural brothers. In the self-report survey segment, 'bro' was utilized while interacting with close friends and siblings. Three females and one male use 'bro' to
