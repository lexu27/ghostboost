Supply chains may be extremely prone to hacking and malware assaults and, based on the attacker’s motivation, are vulnerable to actions aimed at stealing substantial amounts of money and disrupting business. Yeniyurt and Carnovale (2021) point out that cybercriminals are reluctant to impede the rise of cyber threats and devise new methods to pilfer information from individuals and organizations of all magnitudes. The most prevalent cyber hazards in supply chain management encompass data breaches, supply chain disturbance, and malware assaults. Data breaches can arise through external and internal trespassers. Workers, crackers, malevolent competitors, and administrators can divulge sensitive data and personal information beyond the enterprise. Supply chain disturbance arises when a cracker or assailant penetrates an operational system or network without authorization. The objective of penetration is to incite chaos on the system by removing, replicating, and spoiling data. Malware assaults can happen with the assistance of ransomware that obstructs the computer until the firm remits a specific sum of money.
One of the cyberattack mechanisms is dispatching a phishing email to acquire information. Ghadge et al. (2020) affirm that selecting a link in an email might culminate in data distortion and loss. If the phishing email prospers, the enterprise can ascertain the username and password used externally to gather data on the system. It can result in unforeseen competition and severe leaks that could jeopardize the entire corporation.
The sophistication of assaults and the intricacy of contemporary IT, utilizing technologies such as virtualization, mobile, and cloud computing, are compelling companies to boost the safeguarding of their information and implement defense-in-depth technologies. According to Gaudenzi and Siciliano (2018), to effectively tackle cyber hazards, a substantial cyber and IT risk management strategy is essential that takes into account various corporate functions. Elevated IT security criteria for networks, software, and mobile devices, personnel awareness training, continuous process enhancement, and stringent access rights management and guidelines aid in combating the aforementioned cyber hazards. In return, cyber risk insurance is evolving as a pivotal element in IT risk management for numerous companies to oversee residual risks.
A cyber-attack on a firm’s supply chain is not solely an immediate predicament but also carries medium and long-term repercussions. Initially, cyber-attacks culminate in the forfeiture of exterior information. Cybercriminals procure information owned by the platform’s users, which is meant to be a secure setting. Secondly, cyber-attacks also result in the loss of internal information. It poses a grave issue for the firm as its corporate information security will be severely jeopardized. It may suffer from the misappropriation of internal data or classified information that is indispensable to the company’s day-to-day operations.
Thirdly, cyber-attacks lead to the degradation of the firm’s reputation. If users have their data filched from an external platform, then they are improbable to trust this platform in the future. Fourth, cyber-attacks lead to severe penalties for the enterprise. While there is no comprehensive national privacy statute in the United States, there exist numerous sector-specific data privacy and security statutes at the federal level. Furthermore, there are several other state and local privacy statutes. Thus, the pertinent authorities vigilantly oversee companies that breach these prerequisites. One of the repercussions of identity theft can be the acknowledgment that the enterprise has flouted the law, resulting in potential multimillion-dollar fines.
