A Rose for Emily is a superb illustration of the Southern Gothic category. The Southern Gothic is a literal tradition that emerged in the 20th century and gained popularity in European literature. The genre is anchored in enigmatic secrets, supernatural occurrences, alarming situations, and extreme character distress, which desensitizes the reader. The genre emphasizes absurd and macabre elements like hidden passageways, dilapidated castles, and intertwined cobwebs. The Southern Gothic genre delves into the unsociable behaviors that rebel against societal standards and hinge on the notion that everyday life and these societal conventions were merely imaginary. A Rose For Emily introduces the concept of psychological disorder, homicides, love-loss which ultimately constructs a chilling atmosphere for the audience, thus fitting a Gothic Tale.
Primarily, A Rose for Emily highlights the Southern Gothic style through the townsfolks embellishing Homer’s murder. Following Emily’s father's demise, she secluded herself from society, and her residence began to deteriorate and emit a foul odor. The magistrate dispatched some township men to tidy up the place, but instead, they sprinkled lime over the premises. The township could have aided Emily and disposed of the father’s corpse, but instead, they were anxious if she required assistance (Sullivan 175). It is evident that the townspeople hold affection for Emily and revere her. This aspect is noticeable when she purchased the rat poison “So the next day we all said, “She will kill herself”; and we said it would be the best thing.” (Faulkner 6). They were impressed by her, yet they nurtured sentiments of intense aggression. The town avoided associating with her, yet they were concerned for her, which compelled her to procure the arsenic to eliminate Homer Barron. Instead of doing the righteous deed, the town opted to mask the crime. Their act of turning a blind eye to Homer Barron’s demise highlights the element of the extreme character distress in the Southern Gothic genre.
Furthermore, A Rose for Emily embodies the theme of lost love, embodying Southern Gothic narratives. When Emily encountered Homer, a foreman, matrimony was conceivable. However, issues of her societal status surfaced, as evident when the town whispered, “Of course, a Grierson would not ponder seriously of a Northerner, a day laborer… sorrow could not induce a genuine lady to overlook noblesse oblige” (Faulkner 5). Homer’s perception of his affection towards Emily was askew, yet he spent time with her. Nonetheless, it was rumored that Homer was homosexual and he favored men (Faulkner 6). Emily perceived the relationship from a romantic standpoint, while Homer viewed it as spiritual. This instilled fear in Emily of being alone as unrequited love is agonizing (Liu 198). This prompted her to procure wedding accouterments for herself and Homer, invite him for dinner, and poison him with arsenic. Thus, A Rose for Emily depicts a romantic love intertwined with dysfunctionality as expounded in the Southern Gothic narratives.
Likewise, lost love is also delineated between Emily and her father, as seen in Southern Gothic themes. Emily’s father governed her life, rendering it nearly impossible for her to engage with the town and also prohibiting her from a romantic liaison “We recalled all the young men her father had repelled” (Faulkner 4). A schism arose between Emily’s father and the extended family due to property disputes; hence she was solely left with her father to instruct her on love. He also undertook the role of shielding her as depicted in this passage, “father a sprawled silhouette in the foreground, his back to her and clutching a horsewhip” (Faulkner 4). Emily leaning against her father’s back denoted more concern for his physical well-being and safeguarding her. Following his passing, Emily was utterly adrift as she was clueless on how to love conventionally. This elucidates her demeanor of lacking any trace of grief and why she concealed her father's demise from the town for nearly three days. The affection of an excessively protective father that bars her from social interactions serves as an instance of a Southern Gothic narrative.
Additionally, Southern Gothic style is manifested in A Rose for Emily through appropriation and metamorphosis. The narrator morphs Emily’s innocence into a psychologically impaired spinster. Initially, Emily is portrayed as the protagonist at the commencement of the narrative. She was once the flawless young affluent lady residing with her father. Her privileged status led her to be emotionally and physically sequestered; she becomes erratic in her conduct (Huang 205). Initially, she refuted her father's demise for about three days. The town sided with her, asserting “we knew that with nothing left, she would have to cling to that which had robbed her, as people will.” (Faulkner 4). Nevertheless, the town found it challenging to rationalize how she cohabited and spent years with Homer’s cadaver. Her erratic behavior is also evident when she is requested to remit her taxes by the Board of Abelderm. She becomes irate, retorting, “I have no taxes in Jefferson” (Faulkner 2). Despite being informed that no public decree exempted her from tax obligations, she persisted in denial. Her mental instability exemplifies a character in the Southern Gothic narrative.
Moreover, Faulkner integrates Southern Gothic elements throughout the tales. Initially, the author’s depiction of Emily’s residence imparts an aura of enigmatic secrets to the reader (Xiaokang 95). He describes it as “It was a substantial, square-shaped frame house that had formerly been white, embellished with cupolas and spires and scrolled balconies in the lavishly illuminating style of the seventies” (Faulkner 1). Homer’s demise transpired in the same abode, and his remains were left to decompose there. The narrative’s backdrop indicates it was crafted in the Southern Gothic epoch. Emily was the ultimate descendant of his kin that had dwelt in that township for generations. The tax collectors traversed door to door levying taxes which categorized him as a southern gothic. Such scenes and fostering a cryptic ambiance throughout the story underscore that A Rose for Emily was a Southern Gothic narrative.
The narrative embodies Southern Gothic literature through enslavement, racism, and oppressive patriarchal forces. Southern Gothic continued to exalt racism and enslavement despite its abolition, where African Americans were still perceived as a servant class. This is initially evidenced by Colonel Santos proclaiming that “the decree that no Negro woman should appear on the streets without an apron-exonerated her taxes” (Faulkner 1). He exhibits racial prejudice as he favorably exempts Emily from tax obligations and fabricates a tale that his father had loaned the town money. The setting of the book reflected the slavery element based on Tobe’s treatment. The narrative characterizes Tobe as a black man which connotes racism in the Southern Gothic era. The author corroborates this when he states, “They were admitted by the old Negro…The Negro led them into the parlor” (Faulkner 1). We witness him being emancipated from his duties subsequent to Emily. Tobe had aged over the years.
