The notion of nursing is closely linked with the concept of continuous enhancement, as the tendencies of healthcare must reflect the current societal trends to offer the finest care achievable. One method to ensure such care is to consult the most recent academic discoveries to adjust the methods of care provision in the workplace. This process of integrating research-based discoveries into daily patient care is recognized as evidence-based practice (EBP) (Wilson & Austria, 2021). Presently, EBP is not actively employed by nurses for various reasons.
Initially, the workload of most nurses hinders their willingness to educate themselves and accept EBP. According to McArthur et al. (2021), a physical chance is a factor that impacts the nurses’ capability to resort to EBM. Physical chance encompasses obstacles such as “expense and scarcity of resources, impaired communication, personnel turnover, and restricted physical guidelines” (McArthur et al., 2021, p. 20). Consequently, management encourages behavioral trends that react to the environment rather than analyzing it beforehand. The second significant obstacle to EBP in the workplace is the absence of social opportunity demonstrated by the lack of organizational backing and collaboration (McArthur et al., 2021). As the above-mentioned illustrations only address a small portion of the prevailing obstacles, the necessity to intervene and promote EBP is apparent.
The first frequently mentioned strategy to promote the adoption of EBP is to establish a leadership that would endorse the practice by both demonstrating and organizing training and workshops. Another crucial promoter is to ensure nurses' entry to pertinent sources in the workplace, encompassing relevant databases, stable Internet connection, and subscription to peer-reviewed publications. This way, the utilization of scholarly research will become more efficient in terms of time and less demanding for nurses.
