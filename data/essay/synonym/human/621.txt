The primary impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on businesses is evident in the chaos that this epidemic has brought to the global supply networks. Primarily, numerous suppliers were unable to manufacture goods temporarily due to safety measures. Others were unable to transport them due to congested ports, exceedingly high shipping costs, and displaced cargo containers, among other concerns. Even though the influence of the epidemic had decreased in the past year following the introduction of vaccines and the relaxation of movement restrictions, the repercussions of this worldwide disaster on the supply chains endure.
The most notable consequence of the epidemic and the alterations within the business settings are observed in small enterprises. This can be exemplified by Amazon's expansion, which was accelerated at the onset of the epidemic. As individuals were instructed by their authorities to remain at home, the majority of customers opted for online shopping to fulfill their requirements. Consequently, customers placed orders for most of their products online, encompassing groceries, apparel, personal belongings, and other items. Amazon prospered with its capacity to distribute goods through its advanced network of supply chains, while small physical stores were compelled to shut down as they could not endure prolonged periods without profits. Furthermore, these small enterprises lacked the financial means to invest in developing websites and delivery services. In addition to this, Amazon has been criticized for utilizing data from its minor suppliers to replicate popular items and market them under Amazon's brand. Therefore, the e-commerce behemoth possesses the resources and capabilities to overshadow any small enterprise, intensifying the competitive landscape significantly for small businesses, even in the post-epidemic era.
Clearly, the incapacity of a company to procure goods from suppliers has emerged as a major menace to the company's expansion and advancement. Consequently, in the post-epidemic era, executives will need to reassess the function of supply chains in their strategic blueprints and allocate more focus to establishing efficient supply chains. Moreover, even when the shipping costs revert to their previous rates, executives may consider reevaluating their sources of procurement and opt for local suppliers over those in China or emerging economies. This alternative would be more secure in the event of another disruption, and given the ongoing challenges with deliveries that companies currently face, the increased expenses of local suppliers may now be comparable to the reduced production costs overseas combined with elevated shipping fees.
I believe that these transformations in the nature of supply chains and consumer behaviors will be enduring, and businesses should reorganize themselves to confront the new challenges. Mainly, over the two years of the epidemic's impact, consumers have grown accustomed to predominantly making online purchases. This approach is both convenient and time-saving, and it is improbable that consumers will revert to in-person shopping once all restrictions are lifted. Regarding companies, numerous executives had to innovate to sustain their operations amidst disruptions in the supply chains. These fresh strategies enabled businesses to flourish during the epidemic, and there is a possibility that these business models will persist in the days ahead. Hence, the modifications in the business climate induced by the epidemic are likely to endure in the foreseeable future.
