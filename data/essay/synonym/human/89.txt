As evident from the heading, the focal point of the article "Positive leadership psychology: Authentic and servant leadership in higher education in Pakistan" is the Pakistani educational system, whose structure the writers examine through the perspective of leadership. Specifically, they scrutinize the role of centralized guidance in the learning process and speculate on which approach can impact its participants in the most advantageous ways. Particularly, the piece underscores the significance of trust-based relationships in education. According to the writers, any oppressive hierarchy, stringent subordination, or an environment of complete submission hinders individuals from openness, presenting a significant barrier to social interaction. The latter is viewed as the basis of effective teamwork and assumes an awareness of the other's emotions as well as reasons for seeking the most suitable behavioral models. Hence, within Bloom's taxonomy, more precisely, its cognitive sphere, the article delineates the knowledge, the fundamental level.
The release is rather cohesive and well-organized, which denotes its suitable quality. Remarkably, the results of the analysis are presented in a comprehensible manner and effectively serve to exemplify the theoretical foundation, in which section the writers discuss the necessity of appropriate leadership in organizations.

The overall inference is the importance of mutual esteem and commitment to acknowledging everybody's requirements, which forms the basis of servant leadership as a method.

As mentioned, Current Psychology, the worldwide peer-reviewed research platform, approved their work for publication, indicating that it meets its rather specific quality standards.
