The PEACE Act of 2012 was crafted by Anna Eshoo to establish a restriction on the permitted volume of a commercial advertisement on television. According to the tale, the concept of the Act originated when the Congresswoman was disrupted by a noisy TV commercial during the family dinner. Following the PEACE Act of 2012 was implemented, the amount of grievances began to gradually decrease, however it never ceased. This is because the regulation was not flawless, and there were methods to bypass the loudness restriction while still broadcasting a loud commercial. With the COVID-19 pandemic, individuals began to spend more time watching TV, and the number of grievances increased by 140 percent, which is proof of the Actâ€™s mixed outcomes (Yang et al., 2021). Most of it is credited to the alternate methods of saturating the sound of the audio track, such as compressing, which amplifies the quiet frequencies louder without boosting the overall level of loudness of the mix.
