It is crucial to observe that the decision-making procedure is a complicated and highly detailed activity, which includes the precision of the information, a clear vision of goals, and an understanding of the underlying matters. Mistakes in the decision-making procedure are typical and can be executed by any supervisor. Nevertheless, there is a distinct contrast between a poor decision and an incorrect decision. In the scenario of the latter, the decision is the consequence of dependence on false or inaccurate information with the best intentions to make a proper choice. When it concerns a poor decision, a supervisor is conscious of and possesses precise information and a proper comprehension of key elements but deliberately selects the inappropriate direction. A poor decision might arise due to a broad array of factors, which can encompass a conflict between a supervisor’s self-interests and organizational goals or simply emotional influence on the decision-making. However, incorrect decisions require modifications in the procurement of precise and dependable information on which the proper decision can be executed. In both instances, it is highly pertinent to enhance one’s decision-making abilities both presently and in the future. Such an enhancement necessitates an escalation in the integrity of processes of data acquisition and collection. It is indicated that decisions can be “impaired by various inconsistencies and errors, which negatively impact the value of these data for any decision-making processes” (Schuh et al., 2017, p. 425). Therefore, appropriate automation of data collection methods on the grounds of accuracy and integrity can significantly boost the overall knowledge accessible to a supervisor. By having the capacity to perceive a broader and clearer depiction of a situation, a supervisor will be proficient in making accurate decisions.
