Despite numerous appeals to focus on client contentment or enhance work involvement, myriad American business leaders remain fixated on their firms’ financial expansion. Nevertheless, generating a profit is the sole method the world can use to determine if a company is operating correctly. Additionally, if a company stops earning money, it might halt its activities completely. Evidently, some enterprises lack the monetary assets to fully leverage existing product market growth prospects. Others do not possess opportunities that align with their financial resources. Funding sources and product-market chances impact the pace at which a company can expand.

To comprehend how quickly a company should expand, a supervisor must initially explore the link between “inflation, capital expenses, profitability, growth, and the market value of a company’s common stock” (Fruhan, 2014, para. 4). The profitability of a company relies on two factors: the anticipated return on equity (ROE) and the capital cost. If ROE is anticipated to outstrip the equity capital cost, additional growth will only positively affect the business’s activities and well-being.

Conversely, if ROE is not forecasted to surpass the capital cost, then the company should contemplate a strategy of swift negative growth. Insufficient earnings combined with the need to merely finance inflation-induced revenue growth can be disastrous for the firm’s value (Fruhan, 2014). Companies in this scenario should consider a prompt decelerating growth plan if they are unable to boost revenue.

Nonetheless, to sustain suitably established growth, a company must fulfill inflation projections and even exceed the inflation rate. For instance, if an inflation rate is 10%, the company must not solely sustain its earnings to outperform the inflation rate but strive to achieve superior outcomes. As per the data provided by Dow Jones, between 1965 and 1981, the inflation rate surged considerably each year (Fruhan, 2014). Hence, while Treasury bonds produce roughly 11%, the overall long-term inflation projections amount to 10% (Fruhan, 2014). This implies that companies must expand rapidly enough to maintain the equity capital cost for common stock at 19–20%.

Therefore, a business should expand in line with the inflation rate and other indicators. Consequently, to remain appealing to investors, an organization must be mindful of a protracted inflation rate. While Treasury bonds are anticipated to yield 10% annually, companies ought to offer a premium of 9–10%, which ultimately equals 19–20% growth. If a company cannot meet investor expectations and exceed the inflation rate, it is doomed. Furthermore, a company must examine its ROE and the equity capital cost. When the former exceeds the latter, a company will manage to foster substantial growth. If a business overlooks these two aspects and expands more rapidly than it can handle, it can inflict more damage on its financial well-being.
