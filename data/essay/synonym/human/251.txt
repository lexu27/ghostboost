Premature placement and image issues faced by Stella Artois in the UK marketplace can be cited as prominent instances of inconsistency between the selling price and advertising effort. Despite the brand's original intention to be a costly premium item, blending the high alcohol content with decreasing the price gave the impression that this item was tailored for general use. Given that other reputable brands tended to reduce alcohol levels and raise prices, Stella Artois gained a subpar reputation compared to them. Therefore, it can be inferred that it is crucial to scrutinize the market entry and potential rivals, assess customer expectations, and determine if product distinctions could lead to unexpected perceptions.

The market expansion model is a superb manual for industry progress, permitting the growth of beer sales. By considering the demographic traits and product characteristics, adhering to the recommended strategy for the current stage of development could yield pertinent insights into increasing category volume and brand sales. For example, being mindful of the preferred method of beer consumption by customers can help grasp the market segment and deliver the specific product anticipated by the target audience. Additionally, this approach could prevent missteps related to irrelevant beer segments and product categories. Furthermore, as diverse social factions start consuming beer, the brand can be adjusted to cater to their needs, creating new segments, encouraging shifts in consumption, and propelling market evolution towards the subsequent phase.

In my view, the challenge in launching the brand in Mexico might be linked to the availability of the Water.org initiative. Since this offer was only accessible in specific nations, excluding Mexico, it could be inferred that customers were uninterested in engaging with the promoted campaign. Additionally, the nature of the campaign might have contributed to the setback, as customers expected a different approach for a new product, one that directly tackled a significant issue rather than extolling its virtues. Bearing in mind the substantial water usage in brewing beer, promoting water accessibility through beer consumption could have resonated with consumers, fostering a negative perception of the brand.

Introducing Stella Artois into the South African market presented several notable benefits for the company. Given the recent water restrictions in Cape Town due to a water crisis, offering customers an extra water supply significantly bolstered the chances of success. Furthermore, with the South African beer market showing steady growth, it was an opportune moment to enter. However, a major drawback of centering the launch in South Africa on the Water.org sponsorship is the use of a highly visible water issue as a marketing ploy. Moreover, South Africa was at an early stage of market development, meaning that introducing a luxury brand contradicted customer expectations.

From my standpoint, it would be vital to shift the emphasis to additional water access to address the ethical dilemma between water access and beer promotion. Moreover, altering the customary approach could prove highly advantageous for the South African campaign, presenting Stella Artois beer as suitable for bar consumption rather than a premium high-cost brand. As consumers become more acquainted with the product, the scope of the marketing drive could be broadened in the future.
