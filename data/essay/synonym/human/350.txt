Synopsis
Prophylactic healthcare is built on the assumption that lifestyle choices, environmental aspects, and genetic predispositions all play a part in the health consequences of individuals. Consequently, the primary goal of preventive care is to tackle these factors and avert diseases from occurring. The approaches for enhancing preventative care are examined, and a scheme suggested that can be standardized across all healthcare facilities. Some of the approaches have been researched and are presented in the current literature. Instances include primary care visits, clinical decision support systems, and cognitive-behavioral therapy. The suitability of each of these approaches can be assessed from a project management viewpoint where the recommendations involve the implementation of a single comprehensive program that integrates all of them. Therefore, the project lifecycle approach is utilized for this task where four stages are executed: initiation, planning, execution, and control/monitoring.

Commencement
Public health is a significant concern for many nations, as demonstrated by the devastating impacts of the recent coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Lifestyle choices, environmental elements, and genetic predispositions all impact the health outcomes of individuals. Thus, there is a necessity to target these elements to avert diseases. This is the core of preventative care as practices globally. The focus of this paper is on recognizing and executing methods to boost preventative care measures. Principles of project management are utilized, encompassing identification and delineation of the project scope, emphasizing the roles and obligations of stakeholders, and recognizing critical resources needed to accomplish the established goals.

The consequences of this investigation imply that it aids in implementing the concepts proposed by prior work in this field. In connection to prior work, a thorough examination of existing literature reveals methods that can be employed to amplify preventative care measures. The research strategy includes a methodical review of literature to collect ideas about the feasible options and utilize these ideas to devise practice recommendations.

Project Declaration
The project concentrates on preventative care, a topic that has been tackled from various viewpoints in literature. For example, AHRQ, (2018) designates preventative cases as a way of attaining health equity by abolishing the health inequalities in a nation's population. Nonetheless, the fundamental concept is that preventative care is the optimum approach to a nation's health outcomes as it thwarts diseases and pandemics from ravaging the population. As per Ngwewondo et al. (2020), the COVID-19 serves as an exemplary case to illustrate how preventive measures function. In their study, the authors established that most of the respondents scored high in preventative measures and positive health-seeking behaviors. While such findings underscore that preventative measures were taken, a substantial population still endured the symptoms of COVID-19.

In other contexts such as the United Kingdom (UK), several preventative measures encompassed the establishment of an innovation hub that concentrates on boosting preventative healthcare. During the pandemic, the hub was utilized as a vaccination center and proved effective (HHM Global, n.d.). Such innovation has prompted the stakeholders to contemplate creating similar facilities as a preparation for future pandemics. Therefore, there is a necessity to scrutinize the effectiveness of preventative measures and find a way to make them even more effective.

Significance of the Issue
The significance of this project is demonstrated by the recent health challenges facing the globe, including infections and pandemics. As mentioned earlier, these health outcomes are influenced by the environment in which we reside. Thus, this endeavor acts as a model to be utilized by the pertinent stakeholders to implement superior healthcare practices. The importance of preventative health measures is outlined, and the methods to boost its measures are recommended. The implications of the project imply that the policymakers in the healthcare sector will embrace the proposed methods. Furthermore, preventive care necessitates the relevant authorities to make the essential investments (Health Business, 2019). Consequently, the proposed project should inform all stakeholders on the pathways to follow to amplify preventative health measures.

Review of Literature
The present literature on preventative care has frequently focused on its advantages and approaches, often accentuating that it is the finest way to tackle some of the major health problems facing society. As per Hostetter et al., (2020), primary care visits have been known to influence health behaviors, but connections between these visits and preventive interventions remain uncertain. In this instance, primary care visits are perceived as a mechanism for receiving preemptive care in forms such as vaccinations, colonoscopy, and mammography. The inference drawn is that at least one primary visit a year will amplify evidence-based preventative care measures without any increase in costs. The same observations have been made by Sabety et al. (2021), who determines that primary care visits enhance the quality of care, patient outcomes, and improved delivery of preventative services. The outcomes of this form of care encompass lower rates of hospitalization and fewer emergency visits. Consequently, the overall cost of care is also significantly reduced. Thus, primary care visits can be considered one of the most effective approaches to increasing preventative care measures.

Decision support systems are regarded as a crucial method for enhancing preventative care measures and outcomes. A study by Bowen (et al., 2017) asserts that a decision support system enhances the performance of preventive health quality measures where care is executed elsewhere, and patient exceptions are captured. While this study emphasizes performance, the bottom line is that the clinical decision systems effectively capture patient data and identify those eligible for preventative care. Preventative visits were also found to increase after implementing the clinical decision support systems for the population used in the study. Other studies have concentrated on specific health problems where these systems, the findings indicate that clinical decision support systems improve recognition and management (Kharbanda et al., 2018). In their study, Kharbanda et al. (2018) discovered that innovative systems had the potential of pooling useful patient-specific data that could be printed and shared among different users. Moreover, the systems contained guidelines for preventative measures and approaches that could be followed by the practitioners. Consequently, decision support systems for clinicians can be an effective method for increasing preventative healthcare measures.

Another method that has been covered in the literature is cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). According to Suganuma et al. (2018), unguided internet-based CBT has proven an effective method for preventative healthcare for mental health. However, the researchers have presented a pilot study to examine its acceptability and feasibility. The evidence from the study shows internet-guided CBT to be an ideal approach even though it has failed to gather the necessary attention. The rationale is that the use of technology in CBT should not be any different from face-to-face therapy sessions. Nevertheless, the internet only differs from traditional practices in the mainstream delivery of the services. Despite mental care being the focus of this study, the findings can be generalized over other major health issues. Smartphone delivered CBD has also been investigated by Bakker et al. (2018), who determines that the use of apps to track health issues aids in increased preventive care outcomes, including anxiety, depression, and other elements of mental health. The bottom line is that CBT, whether delivered traditionally or using new technologies, should be an effective tool for increasing preventive care outcomes.
