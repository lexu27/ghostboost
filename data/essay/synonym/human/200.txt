A digital engagement strategy establishes how the organization plans to position itself online. The policy also encompasses the company’s brand characteristics and its vision and mission goals. It also dictates how employees can communicate digitally, both internally and externally, with suppliers and clients (Brown, 2019). Furthermore, the aforementioned guidelines also address social media interaction practices that could impact the business, either adversely or favorably.
Our company possesses a digital engagement strategy that it employs to safeguard its brand's reputation. Additionally, the above approach has empowered the business to enhance employees’ dedication while increasing the levels of their commitment. Consequently, employees share more information about the organization online, thereby contributing to increased sales and profits. Moreover, with the above regulations in effect, the firm’s confidential data is protected as it is not disclosed online.
My professional online presence is in harmony with the organization as it involves showcasing the company’s offerings and services and engaging with all stakeholders. My online presence fosters strong relationships with customers, acquaintances, and followers, which benefits the business by enhancing its image. This has assisted the organization in staying relevant by presenting its clients with a ‘human touch.’
I utilize social media platforms to endorse my brand by concentrating on various social networks. Additionally, I generate informative and captivating content about the company’s products and ensure all information is current and precise before publishing. It is crucial to engage in consistent online marketing while avoiding excessive posting to prevent appearing desperate. All updates on achievements and noteworthy developments are posted 3 to 4 times per week.
The subjects I frequently share on social media to market my brand pertain to the pricing of the products. I also highlight the advantages of using our goods and services while drawing comparisons with others in the market. I predominantly focus on sharing achievements and developments but refrain from posting any negative remarks made by an individual or an unsatisfied customer to prevent sparking a detrimental online conversation that could tarnish the brand.
Upon finishing the program, I intend to alter how I handle any negativity and will not disregard any unfavorable feedback as it provides insights into the customer’s experience. Additionally, I will commence implementing strategic marketing, such as formulating a method to target my audience based on the social media platform, scheduling my content, and adjusting the communication approaches.
