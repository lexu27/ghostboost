According to the conversation, the presence of medieval civilization existed in a decade filled with plague, famine, social unrest, and unprecedented desire for social mobility. I concur with the concepts as the pivotal turning point of this significant influence was the Black Death, which greatly disrupted the socio-economic status of the people (Tuchman 230). Prior to the epidemic, life for the peasants was secure and medical technology and methods were advancing during this specific era. The church was also a prevailing power as it quickly developed in this century. The majority of the populace could grasp the sermon as the preaching was delivered in vernacular. Furthermore, in that era, most individuals were uneducated and it was difficult to own books as they were costly. Women were anticipated to be obedient as they relied on their husbandsâ€™ courtship. Children were brought up on high ethical standards as society instilled certain values to be adhered to.
