The authentic notion of a Decision Support System (DSS) characterized it as a computerized assisting aid for decision-makers. It functions to collect and scrutinize extensive amounts of data to enhance the capabilities but not to supplant the course of the initial decision. Such a system can be effortlessly programmed for user requirements and output data in visual form, for instance, to predict a company’s future revenue. Business Intelligence (BI) is a broad term that is utilized to illustrate a fusion of analytical tools, approaches, and applications. (Sharda 2019). DSS stemmed from BI, yet remains the most utilized system at present. Reporting plays a significant role in the utilization of Business Intelligence, in accordance with which the user must ascertain for himself whether a specific situation merits attention, and only then can apply analytical techniques.
The primary contrast between these two definitions is that DSS is a computerized system for acquiring information that aids in decision-making in an organization or business community. Simultaneously, BI functions as a tool that employs various programs that aid in arranging and overseeing data or valuable information within an organization. While DSS aids the user in identifying errors existing in the program and analyzing information for decision-making, BI assists with automated analysis and, hence, provides recommendations that have only the execution stage remaining. Another distinction is that DSS necessitates more time to commence implementation since the procedures largely consist of manual processing. BI requires less time to carry out all functions since the computer thinks autonomously and hence does not necessitate manual oversight.
Analytics can be considered a process of formulating practical solutions or recommendations for actions based on information obtained from historical data. The significance of the term analytics has significantly broadened and no longer serves to specify individual components of computer technologies formerly accessible under specific designations. (Sharda 2019). Nowadays, analytics is a fusion of technology, scientific methods, and statistics amalgamated to solve particular issues. Entire sectors resort to data analytics to create reports on current occurrences and foresee future repercussions. Nearly all managers are starting to comprehend how crucial the analytical aspect is for advancing their field and resort to technological systems to streamline these processes.
In the realm of healthcare, analytics encompasses a broad array of applications, from diagnostics to efficient fraud deterrence. One illustration is an analytic approach to the tumbles of the elderly populace. Injuries sustained from falling diminish the count of the elderly population and evolve into a pivotal issue for the group of the population over 65 years old. Consequently, such a scenario notably escalates the government’s expenditures for treating the elderly. As per the data, the direct costs of falls were gauged at $34 billion in 2013 alone. (Sharda 2019). At present, falls are one of the primary factors of both fatal and non-fatal injuries in individuals over 65 years old. It is also noteworthy that they escalate the likelihood of disability in this demographic by up to 50 percent. Currently, there is no stringent identification methodology for pinpointing a group of individuals predisposed to injuries from falls since this statistic cannot be as objective as cancer or diabetes mellitus. Nevertheless, such analytical investigations have aided in raising awareness of the issue and taking tangible steps to mitigate the risks of falls (for instance, heightened utilization of physical therapy services).
