Introduction
Dairy preservation is a primary concern for extensive-scale dairy farmers worldwide. The commodity must stay fresh from the origin to the end-user. This has led to the creation of dairy tools that assist farmers and dairy facilities in handling and conserving the commodity. Aspects such as the presence of microorganisms in the dairy products reduce the time the goods stay fresh and suitable for consumption (Garcia et al., 2019). The state of the machinery must be maintained clean to ensure the goods do not spoil or become unsuitable for human consumption. Additionally, some of the devices aid dairy processors in producing various types of dairy products like cheese, cream, butter, and so forth. By using the tools in the production process, individuals have been able to reduce the expenses involved, such as labor, and lessen the time taken during packaging. The main focus of this article is to examine dairy tools and the current technological participation.
Context
Dairy facilities have evolved to utilize tools that facilitate processes such as dairy production, pasteurization, packaging, storage, and transportation. Initially, these activities were costly and time-consuming when technology was limited (Charlton & Kostandini, 2021). Presently, advancements in engineering have made the processes convenient due to the introduction of various machines that perform the functions effectively. Most dairy farms have access to equipment like containers for storing milk, cream mixer, milk vessels, tubular heat exchangers, and evaporation systems that assist in the processes. The machines are beneficial in ensuring farmers do not suffer unnecessary losses due to poor preservation. They have enhanced dairy farming since the facilities can handle the volume of milk produced.
Technology for Dairy products back in the 1900s
There has been a progress in dairy products over the last century. The dairy processing industry has been expanding gradually to offer dairy foods that meet the requirements of human diets concerning nutrients, safety, and overall sustainability. Around 1917, private dairy farmers introduced dairy products to their consumers in their localities (Rankin et al., 2017). During this era, farmers had begun embracing pasteurization as the method of conserving and controlling milk from contamination by certain diseases.
In the dairy processing factory, the mechanization of cream separation, filling, washing bottles, and sealing them laid the foundation of modernization in the sector. Between 1907 and 1913, bottle machines were employed along with the fillers and sealers (Capstaff & Miller, 2018). To enhance the safety and improve sanitation of the dairy products, advancements were made on the mechanical bottle washers. Many countries enforced mandatory pasteurization processes due to diseases linked to unsafe milk consumption that led to fatalities among adults and children.
The process of milk pasteurization was officially adopted but the techniques, timing, and temperatures varied significantly from farm to farm. There were no heat regulators during that period, hence the process lasted approximately 60 seconds at a temperature of around 72 degrees Celsius followed by immediate cooling. Similarly, proper timing was challenging due to a lack of technology (Charlton & Kostandini, 2021). It was termed flash pasteurization and was not completely accepted due to its limitations. Another contemporary technology involved in the dairy industry is employing the in-bottled technique. In this approach, the bottled milk was subjected to a high temperature of about 63 degrees Celsius for nearly 30 minutes. It proved efficient as it minimized the drawbacks of post-pasteurization.
The progress in technology prompted the enhancement in dairy products as efficient equipment was devised. Tools like a vat holder, warmer, and chiller were utilized to enhance the milk pasteurization process. Another breakthrough in the dairy plant was achieved in 1934 when a mechanical refrigerator was introduced to assist in conserving the products. Regarding sanitation, the use of stainless steel bulk ensured the commodities were kept secure.
Current Technology
Scientists and technologists have been striving to enhance the dairy processing procedure and the quality of the products. Over the past decade, several innovations and advancements in technology have been made to boost productivity in the industry. Some of the current know-how employed aims at reducing costs, prolonging shelf life, and segregating the component products of milk (Akbar et al., 2020). Some of the current technologies utilized in the dairy processing facility are elaborated below.
Milk Analyzer
Liquid milk comprises various constituents like lactose, fat, protein, total solids, and other elements. The dairy processing factories employ the Mid-infrared assessment method to determine the composition of the product (Akbar et al., 2020). Once the analysis is conducted, the outcome is utilized to assess the payment the dairy farmer will receive based on the available constituents. Mid Infrared Spectroscopy also assists farmers in deciding on the type of feeds to provide their animals to affect the required components. The technology is rapid and promotes efficiency in testing milk components.
Automated Sprayer Dryer
Dairy farmers can conduct the necessary quality examinations using the automated sprayer dyer at once. During the examination process, a sample of the milk products is taken and evaluated by infrared technology to ascertain the moisture content in the milk powder, bulk, and temperature (Shinde et al., 2018). There is a particular inline powder developed for the automated sprayer dryer. The process is beneficial as it enables the producers to set warning alerts in case of product loss during the manufacturing process.
Automated Clean-In-Place (CIP) System
This system allows the dairy plants to clean the internal surfaces of the pipes, filters, vessels, associated fittings, and process equipment while they are in place. CIP utilizes sensors, controllers, valves that are well-programmed to enhance effectiveness. It ensures the plant maintains the required level of cleanliness for proper preservation of the milk products (Ledo et al., 2020). Internal cleaning is crucial as the materials come into contact with the milk.
Direct Vat Set (DVS) Cultures
Presently, dairy processing industries are employing some strains of microorganisms to facilitate the production of fermented products. DVS are significant as they have no adverse effects on the consumers and they also boost the immune system (Rankin et al., 2017). The primary reason for implementing the DVS cultures in the milk processing steps is to ramp up production in a relatively shorter time. For instance, it takes about 10 hours to create a curd using a traditional approach whereas with the use of microorganisms, the production time is halved.
High-Performance Liquid Chromatography
High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is a reliable, precise process that aids in detecting the presence of melamine in pasteurized milk, ultra-heat temperatures, soft cheese, milk powder, and powdered infant formula (Ledo et al., 2020). Generally, melamine is an organic chemical compound resembling a white crystal. HPLC enables farmers to easily identify the melamine, hence reducing the time taken in the process.
Enrichment of Milk
In most cases, the composition of milk lacks all the necessary nutrients. To ensure consumers receive the essential minerals, some vitamins not present in the milk products are added (Ledo et al. 2020). Fortified milk is crucial for human consumption as it contains a good balance of beneficial components. The process is vital in enhancing the mineral and vitamin content suitable
