Alcoholic and substance misuse is a substantial concern in New Jersey, and one of its consequences is the opioid outbreak that arose in the state in the last decade. In 2021, Governor Phil Murphy enacted several laws focused on the provision of harm reduction services, hypodermic needle distribution, and local drug overdose fatality review teams established to address the issue (State of New Jersey’s Department of Health, 2022). The latter is a relatively recent policy for New Jersey, and local communities are deliberating its impact on public health and healthcare services practice. Bill A798/S52 is implemented following the model of other states where opioid use is regulated by law, and individuals with adequate expertise and experience in dealing with addiction treatment are engaged (Senate Health, Human Services and Senior Citizens Committee 2021). This paper aims to thoroughly examine the policy concerning the establishment of local drug overdose fatality review teams and discuss how it aligns with the principles of advocacy, public health, and the ANA ethical declarations.
The Bill A798/S52
Legislative oversight is crucial to combat the opioid epidemic as it grants ample authority to effect practice modifications, monitor and eradicate violations, and forecast advancements. Bill A798/S52 was officially unveiled on January 18, 2022, to institute local drug overdose fatality review teams and offer healthcare and social assistance to individuals with alcohol and substance dependencies (State of New Jersey’s Department of Health, 2022). The primary advocates were Verrelli, Vainieri Huttle, Armato/Singer, and Greenstein; they also played a role in enacting other regulations related to the opioid epidemic. The policy delineates the undertakings of the accountable groups, such as formulating strategies to reduce overdose incidents statewide, investigating the root causes of abuse to suggest further legislative enhancements, and aiding the impacted (Senate Health, Human Services and Senior Citizens Committee 2021). Consequently, the primary objective the drug overdose fatality review teams will pursue is to become the trusted intermediary between the individuals in need and the government.
Bill A798/S52 is advantageous for the health of the populace even though it does not involve any direct intervention or medical services provision. As the drug overdose fatality review teams will be established in multiple regions, they will enhance the government’s data collection and prompt notification of significant deviations even in the smallest municipalities (Artiga & Hinton, 2018). Additionally, New Jersey’s Commissioner of Health overseeing the operations of the groups will have to synchronize the abuse scenario with the local healthcare establishments and offer additional resources when required. The concept of advocacy facilitated backing for the susceptible at the legislative level and permit them to elucidate the causes of New Jersey’s opioid epidemic (Artiga & Hinton, 2018). Indeed, the teams will observe and interact with the affected individuals, and alternative avenues to assist them in preventing addictions might arise, resulting in a reduction in substance abuse prevalence.
Nursing practitioners engaged in aiding substance abusers or operating in healthcare institutions with pertinent departments would benefit the drug overdose fatality review teams, and it is ethically sound to join them. The bill does not specify any particular professional prerequisites for the potential participants; they only need to have experience in social or healthcare work with at-risk populations (Haas et al., 2019). Collaborating with the team addresses the principle of selflessness and commitment to professional responsibilities and empowers the practitioner to advocate for fairness in care for diverse populations (American Nurses Association, n. d.). The bill outlines the fundamental harm reduction strategies, and championing for their execution benefits other enhancements in public health policies.
The opioid outbreak is one of the most severe health dilemmas for New Jersey, and formulating viable legislation to tackle it is imperative for the county’s populace. Bill A798/S52 presents the necessity for the specific local drug overdose fatality review teams and defines their rights and duties. The introduction of innovative regulations is advantageous for New Jersey’s healthcare as it will lead to a more precise understanding of the issues, attention, and support initiatives aimed at vulnerable individuals from communities and organizations.
