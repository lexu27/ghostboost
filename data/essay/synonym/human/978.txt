Variety is one problem that has been noticed in numerous establishments globally. Individuals from various spheres of life are brought together through faith, learning, amusement, and residing collectively. When individuals accept their variances, achieving peaceful coexistence ensues (Bell, 2021). Nevertheless, when individuals are unable to synchronize their distinctions and coexist, disorder becomes the essence of existence. Learning is one of the crucial facets that connect individuals from varied backgrounds. Some researchers have pinpointed variety as impacting students’ performance in their academics. The variety of the students is reflected in terms of ethnic, racial, gender, and age dispersion. This document aims to investigate the influence of the aforementioned aspects on academic achievement in my institute.

Age and sex result in a disparity in academic performance in my school. As per the study, the ratio of females to males in the institution is 15000 and 13500 respectively. This signifies that the number of females enrolled in my school slightly surpasses the number of males admitted annually. According to my study, 9% of females completed their studies with distinction while 15% of males achieved distinction. This discovery indicates a performance gap between males and females that could be influenced by other factors. Another study conducted across various educational institutions indicates that males generally outperform females, although there is a minor distinction in performance (Bush et al., 2017). The majority of students in my university fall between the ages of 17 to 24 years. Based on the research results, age does not notably impact performance. However, the findings also reveal that some students who enroll in college at an older age tend to take their academic responsibilities more seriously than their younger counterparts.

Furthermore, racial and ethnic diversity might also impact students’ academic performance at my school. The racial breakdown of students at the institution is as follows; 70% Caucasian, 25% African American, and 5% others. The academic performance of students upon graduation is not influenced by their races as there is no statistical proof of a specific race outperforming others. Nonetheless, the majority of African American students excel in their college education compared to students of other races. Another study suggests that a small percentage of African Americans transition from high school to college, but those who do often perform well (Roksa et al., 2016). According to the research, the ethnic groups were evenly distributed and displayed no significant gap in academic performance.

During the investigations, I observed that students aged over 25 years accounted for 10%. I anticipated that almost all students fell within the age range of 17 to 24 years. Surprisingly, the students over 25 years were excelling in their academic pursuits. This was evident as nearly all of them graduated with at least a passing grade in their studies. According to other studies, older students are expected to perform less effectively than their younger peers due to diminished attention spans caused by their commitments (Chen, 2017). However, based on my research, this is not the case; older students have demonstrated greater dedication to their academic endeavors compared to younger students.

In conclusion, diversity is a commonplace occurrence in every environment and has minimal impact on students’ academic performance. What truly influences their performance extends beyond merely being old, African American, or female. Other elements play a role in creating these distinctions. These additional factors could involve aspects such as surroundings, drive, and financial circumstances. Individuals need to learn to blend their diversity and coexist harmoniously.
