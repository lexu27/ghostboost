The disparities amid the Persian and Greek cultures can be observed in various traditions and practices. In Persia, the contrast between different faiths and dialects was acknowledged by the society, enabling individuals from the conquered territories to persist in their ancestral customs without facing persecution (Brooks, 2019). Conversely, Greeks were less tolerant of other faiths and cultures, compelling compliance with Greek practices from the populations dwelling in their territory (Brooks, 2019).
Another notable dissimilarity was the citizens’ approach toward the authority, with the Persian inhabitants willingly backing the King and remaining profoundly loyal to him (Brooks, 2019). In Greece, where the democratic governance was viewed as the most advantageous, the idea of one individual ruling over others was frowned upon, with the majority of the elite supporting democracy as a fair allotment of power.
The governmental frameworks of Persia and Greece were also markedly different, as each system was designed to support the established governing techniques. Persian administration permitted effective control over separated locations and regulated the influence of the leaders who held the most authority, the political governors, and military generals (Brooks, 2019). On the other hand, the Greek political structure was rooted in democracy, but it was highly unequal and intricate to oversee over vast distances (Brooks, 2019). Another vital aspect of Persian leadership was modest levies, which were augmented only when military forces were needed for warfare. In contrast, the Greek levy system was exceptionally intricate, and to ensure affluence; it heavily depended on Greece’s allies.
The importance of Athens’ downfall in the Peloponnesian conflict is linked to Athens’ role as the city-state that consolidated several Poleis. One contention proposes that subsequent to capitulating to the Spartans, Greece forfeited most of its political and military might, chiefly concentrated in Athens (Brooks, 2019). Another perspective is that the Peloponnesian rout lessened Athens’ opportunities for imperial expansion, subverting the established political hierarchy and diminishing Athens’ sway over other Greek cities.
