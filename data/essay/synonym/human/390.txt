Aims and purposes delineate desired outcomes and, thus, are frequently used interchangeably. However, the impact, timeframe, and specificity of the two terms distinguish them. Nickels et al. (2019) characterize aims as extensive and long-term results that an organization pursues, while objectives specify the measurable, particular, and short-term tactics for achieving the identified aim. For instance, the criminal justice system utilizes aims to assign the police, correctional agencies, and the court with the approach to execute, including deterrence, rehabilitation, retribution, restoration, and incapacitation. Consequently, the criminal justice system particularly deals with criminal behavior with the aim of safeguarding people's rights.
In an age of rapid change, diversity, and complexity, leadership and management are crucial to the survival of any agency. Additionally, the capability to lead and manage strongly permeates every facet of the criminal justice system. While leaders steer the change through a vision, managers carry out coordinated processes and structures to pursue organizational aims and purposes (Nickels et al., 2019). Leaders are consistently challenged to take risks and promote transformation. In law enforcement, for instance, police leaders must cultivate and instill high standards in other officers to work toward the same aim. Beyond leadership, criminal justice relies on managers to optimize processes and lead efforts toward dependable outcomes. Generally, criminal justice leaders and managers work effectively to balance ethical and legal considerations.
Acquiring a degree in criminal justice would significantly contribute to fulfilling my long-term aims. I have always taken pride in influencing change as a leader. Nevertheless, I must leverage my education with experience in the criminal justice system to become more efficient and productive. The criminal justice system is becoming increasingly intricate and demands more enduring and transformative trends. Consequently, the second aim is to become more adaptable to change. Bringing significant change through robust analytical skills is a purpose in itself. Furthermore, acquiring strong relational skills to collaborate with professionals and assist individuals from diverse backgrounds.
