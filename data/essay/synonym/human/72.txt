In Liu and Asimov’s concise narratives, the writers delineate human beings and how synthetic intelligence varies from the human psyche. The author of The Algorithms for Love , Liu Ken, expresses that humans are too juvenile and too immature to comprehend the universal laws of the globe. However, it appears to many that human self-sufficiency and autonomy in wishes and deeds is restrictive. Asimov’s Liar is distinctive as it is one of the writer’s initial endeavors to ponder from diverse perspectives on the contemporary world’s conflict of advanced technology and ethics. Liu and Asimov tackle the issue of synthetic intelligence differently, yet they concur that there is a strong likeness between the cognition of robots and humans.
Liu Ken ponders where the boundary lies between artificial and innate intelligence. He is intrigued whether the robot’s self-learning program can be deemed a person (Ken 5). Essentially, the choices it makes are rooted in experience and knowledge - humans rationalize similarly. The writer proceeds to inquire of his readers whether humans can be viewed as robots with synthetic intelligence, supposing that there is no substantial distinction between the latter and individuals (Ken 5). Thus, Liu Ken directs readers to his ultimate question of who programmed humans in this instance.
Ken’s tale revolves around a young woman named Elena, a programmer and designer for a corporation that produces unconventional playthings - robot androids. Progressing from version to version, she ultimately succeeds in designing a robot that can effortlessly pass the Turing test, capable of conversing like a genuine individual. Nonetheless, she is the sole individual who comprehends that this apparent intelligence is merely the consequence of skilled and proficient programming. Evaluating the outcomes of her efforts, Elena arrives at a disquieting query. She begins to fret that there is a chance that individuals are not intelligent either and merely decipher the algorithms embedded in their internal program from day to day. In this narrative, Ken Liu once again succeeded in combining profound science fiction with nuanced psychology and the poignant destiny of the protagonist in a concise story. This literary creation prompts its readers to embrace the notion of the identity of the artificial and human intelligence.
Among the works of Isaac Asimov, one of the most significant and distinct could be considered a compilation of concise narratives I, Robot . This work most comprehensively conveys the communal and philosophical perspectives of the writer in the early phase of his career (Baysal 172). The sixth narrative in the collection, Liar, clarifies that human psychology, philosophy, and societal regulations captivate Asimov more than the technical aspect of the literary work. Several of Asimov’s musings in this narrative are articulated through the dialogues of the robot RB-34. Herbie mentions that science is of minor interest for him in one of his soliloquies (Asimov 65). This character is considerably more preoccupied with fiction and the intricate and entwined human motivations and sentiments. The soliloquy under scrutiny mirrors Asimov’s inclination for societal and philosophical matters and his faith in art and devotion to the principles of humanism.
The authors are connected by the subjects of the narratives and the dilemmas they raise, though the attention of the writers differs slightly. Asimov propels readers towards the notion that the perfect robot is a human being. Simultaneously, Liu alerts about the repercussions of acknowledging the parity between how humans reason and how robots do. Nonetheless, both authors strive to define what is human and what are the core benefits and drawbacks of being individuals.
