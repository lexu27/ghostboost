"The Coronation of Poppea" narrates how Poppea, who engages in an extramarital relationship with the fifth Roman emperor Nero, ascends to become an empress. Nero vows to elevate her to authority and takes her as his wife despite being wedded to Ottavia and clashing with Seneca (Tommasini 34). The opera might be perceived as controversial as it glorifies infidelity rather than the sanctity of matrimony. Drawing from historical occurrences, it illustrates how a dominant man can deceive his partner and even exile her from her realm without facing consequences or societal disapproval.

Arias, recitatives, and choruses are three distinct terminologies within the realm of music. An aria is a form of musical creation that embodies a tune for a solo presentation and is commonly a segment of a broader composition, like an opera. Arias can be executed with or without backing from orchestras, but the term pertains to tunes rather than pieces that resemble everyday speech. Recitatives are creations frequently found in operas but lack the characteristics of formal musical works, such as rhyme or repetitive verses. Generally, recitative segments sung by vocalists mimic ordinary speech set to music, spanning from conversational to more melodious pieces. Unlike the preceding terms, a chorus denotes a musical element on a different structural tier and denotes a smaller segment of a song distinguished by emphasis and repetition. Also recognized as a refrain, a chorus is often juxtaposed with the rest of the composition and may incorporate additional instruments that enhance richness and dynamic progression.

During the Baroque era, the selection of musical instruments for orchestras facilitated the development of intricate and multi-layered compositions. Baroque orchestras commonly utilized string instruments like violas, violins, or double basses, and woodwind instruments like bassoons, oboes, or flutes. Continuo instruments, such as organs, were employed to complement the other elements and introduce richness and intensity to the performed pieces. Orchestras also actively integrated instruments from the percussion family, such as kettledrums, to underpin the rhythmic aspects of musical works while contributing to harmony. Lastly, brass instruments like Baroque trumpets were another prevalent component of Baroque orchestras.
