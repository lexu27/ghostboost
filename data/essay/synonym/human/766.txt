Artificial intellect (AI) keeps expanding more and more renowned in the domains that engage handling substantial quantities of data within restricted timelines. Promotion is amid those; the solution to triumph in it lies in perpetual awareness of the recent inclinations in the market as well as in consumer conduct, which necessitates never-ending data scrutiny. The utilization of AI, in the meantime, aids automate the procedure, subsequently enhancing the efficiency of enterprises, conceivably by up to 40% (Ramyalg, 2022, para. 3). The enhancement signifies not solely saving time and finances, but also superior quality of client assistance due to the potential to invest more resources in it. Another vital advantage from utilizing AI is the decline of mistake rates by decreasing the human element (“AI could reduce,” 2018). The algorithm does not overlook anything and cannot be fatigued or diverted, which, alongside the incomparably greater pace, renders it significantly more efficient than humans are.
The latter subtlety actually is the reason why many assume that AI will be capable of substituting marketing jobs in the future. Additionally, it is worthwhile noting that the human element encompasses bias and partiality, which can distort assessment and, subsequently, sway the conclusive resolution (“AI could reduce,” 2018). Considering all of the aforementioned, it looks pertinent to speculate that artificial intellect could succeed people in marketing jobs because it is significantly more dependable. In the standpoint of those who endorse this concept, such a transition could culminate in considerably better comprehension of consumer conduct, notably, a broader perspective on the recent inclinations and the catalysts of change.
In reality, however, the utilization of AI cannot eradicate the engagement of people in marketing undertakings. The primary rationale is that it is capable solely to simplify and hasten the accomplishment of specific duties, but not organize and govern the execution of a business autonomously. Notably, solely humans can be imaginative thinkers and produce the notions that set the courses for further activity, for instance, devise marketing campaigns. AI algorithms, in the meantime, are “constructed for repetitive tasks” and can solely aid in analytical routine, but not in decision making (“Will digital marketers be out,” 2021, para. 1). The latter demands not solely creativity, but also critical thought, of which machines remain incapable.
Another ramification of the reality the prior paragraph mentions is the necessity for humans to program AI. Put simply, someone has to inscribe and fine-tune the algorithms that it will adhere to. This actually undermines the above ability of machines to diminish bias because algorithms may encompass it in case their authors are biased towards specific topics or categories of individuals; therefore, their usefulness is restricted.
Associations with patrons that ought to be grounded on faith for utmost efficacy also are a notable domain. Constructing them necessitates emotional reaction and interpersonal links, which abilities are unavailable for AI as well. It can scrutinize queries and formulate responses, leaning on the accessible data, but emotion-propelled communication is beyond its functionality (“Will digital marketers be out,” 2021, para. 1). Meanwhile, personal interactions are pivotal in marketing, akin to any domain that involves labor with customers, owing to which humans are irreplaceable in it. Additionally, utilizing AI may even spawn new jobs due to the need to program it as well as supervise its performance (ibid). The response to the inquiry whether it will supplant marketing jobs in the future, therefore, unequivocally is negative.
