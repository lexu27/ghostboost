Movie titled Dances with Wolves, overseen by Kevin Costner, was adapted from the novel of the identical title by Michael Blake, who later penned the script for the movie. The storyline unfolds during the American Civil War when a courageous lieutenant John Dunbar discovers himself in a deserted fort and immerses himself in Native American society. Despite the director’s team extensively seeking guidance from historical advisors, for instance, Doris Leader Charge, Lakota language teacher, it did not shield the movie from historical critique. Dances with Wolves can be viewed as an ambitious and remarkable first effort of an inexperienced director who handled the portrayal of native Indians thoughtfully and skillfully reflected it in his project. The communal existence of native Indians has been depicted fairly accurately for a movie not grounded on real occurrences. The movie was highly commended for Costner's ability to defy the typical depiction of Native Americans and avoid confining the characters to simplistic stereotypes. The majority of the minor errors in the movie did not significantly affect the comprehension of the complete picture. Russell Means pointed out errors in the application of the Lakota language when some of the male-Natives spoke in the feminine manner. Historian Joseph Roquemore also observed that the Sioux tribe’s stance towards weapons was misconstrued to highlight people's traditional lifestyle (StudyMoose 2020). The movie’s historical inaccuracies were sparked not only by the challenge of representing the Lakota culture but also by Costner's biases and his desire to convey a particular image of the tribe. Despite such errors, the director’s method of representing history was conscientious, aiding him in dispelling the stereotype of a noble savage in the portrayal of a Native American. Kevin Costner’s passion for Native American history was evident long before his direction of Dancing with Wolves, and at 35 years old, he opted to revive the Western genre with his project. He aimed to combat societal prejudices about savage Indians to rekindle long-forgotten connections. Costner depicted the Indians not as a uniform collective but as individuals to humanize them as much as possible. His aspiration to revive interest and deepen understanding of the culture and life of indigenous peoples places the Native Americans at the forefront. The cinematic methods of Dances with Wolves play a significant role in the subtle impact on the audience. Dean Semler as a cinematographer filmed the movie in color and actively utilized lighting to introduce contrasting tones to the overall atmosphere. In the scene where the protagonist is preparing to depart from the tribe, the prevailing mood is melancholy, but the bright light hints at the potential of a brighter future. The central musical theme is a simple trumpet-led tune, somewhat grandiose and anticipatory, though overshadowed by more vibrant musical compositions, such as the bass-heavy The Death of Timmons or The Buffalo Hunt composed specifically for the movie (D’Amata 2020). Overall, the cinematic imagery had a substantial influence on the film's overall impact, rendering it truly memorable and distinctive. On a scale of one to five, I would award the movie 4 points in terms of historical significance and 4 points for entertainment value. The historical aspect enhanced the average person's understanding of Native Americans. However, some minor inaccuracies, at times even deliberate to craft a particular tribal image, prevent me from giving the movie a perfect score. The entertainment factor of the movie can also be highly appreciated as it has garnered immense popularity and critical acclaim. Nevertheless, I would slightly deduct points for the pacing, which might mar the experience for some viewers.
