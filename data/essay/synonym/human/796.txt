One of the notable domains of anthropology, primatology, examines nonhuman primates, their conduct, and social abilities to offer valuable insights into human evolution. Furthermore, one of the main characteristics that could define most apes, particularly chimpanzees, is hostility among the male species. Nevertheless, while aggression plays a significant role in social organization and gender distinctions among nonhuman primates, its impact on human evolution remains implicit. This composition will investigate various displays of aggression among chimpanzees and bonobos, scrutinize and contrast their causes, and establish whether aggression constitutes a significant aspect of human evolution.
One of the most advanced representatives of the great apes' cluster, also recognized as humans' closest living relatives, the chimpanzees, are renowned for their intellect. Chimps are seldom linked with aggressive conduct as they "lack the weapons" customarily associated with violence, such as claws and sharp canines (Stanford, 2018). Nevertheless, despite their high level of advancement, chimps also display a very elevated degree of aggression to the extent of fatal consequences, even towards fellow community members. In reality, only a few animals apart from humans can exhibit such violent conduct. However, as per Preis and Jacob (2019), many chimps acquired various tactics to evade aggressive conduct, like collaboration and conflict resolution, due to the innate fear of harm. While most of the time, chimpanzees coexist peacefully, several factors could trigger aggressive encounters.
The predominant cause of aggressive interaction among chimps is dominance associations. Chimps are profoundly protective of their territories as the size of the territory is intimately linked to food supplies. Food accessibility also constitutes one of the elements of elevated social standing among chimps. As outlined by Preis et al. (2019), a superior dominance level or social standing is connected with numerous fitness advantages, such as improved health, longevity, and even accelerated healing processes. The dominance and subordination hierarchies are mirrored in levels of glucocorticoid hormones utilized to evaluate Hypothalamus-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis function. The investigation carried out by Preis et al. (2019) proposes that urinary glucocorticoid levels are positively associated with aggression rates, indicating that heightened aggression influences glucocorticoid levels. Another study by Preis and Jacob (2019) defined that status contention induces psychosocial stress on all-male species, even during phases of low rates of aggression, which was unveiled through the scrutiny of urinary cortisol levels. Consequently, male chimps endure more stress during periods of intense competition, while aggression emerges chiefly during intervals of low competition due to social instability triggered by food availability or mating.
Moreover, acknowledging that aggression in male chimpanzees is a consequence of an adaptive strategy furnishes crucial context regarding human evolution. As per Stanford (2018), while violent behavior among chimps is viewed as unethical because of its association with humans, in reality, aggression among chimpanzees serves as an amoral mechanism for acquiring additional resources by eliminating rivals. Additionally, it was deduced by Preis et al. (2019) that in scenarios with high risks of escalation, some chimps opt to avoid aggression. Steering clear of aggression and introducing varied forms of conduct to exhibit their competitiveness demonstrates that chimps are capable of employing adaptive strategies and elements of conflict resolution.
On the contrary, aggression is less prevalent among bonobos, who are also regarded as close human counterparts. Besides sharing physical distinctions with chimpanzees, bonobos possess diverse social structure arrangements, which impact conflict resolution methods in bonobos. While bonobos, akin to chimpanzees, safeguard their territory, bonobos feature more intricate inter-group connections where they frequently convene to interact, aligning them with humans (Tokuyama et al., 2019). Despite the fact that bonobos tend to manifest aggression solely towards out-group individuals, they have never been observed killing other bonobos, in contrast to the level of aggression in chimps.
Additionally, there exist notable gender divergences between female chimps and bonobos, as female bonobos enjoy substantially elevated social standing. While there could be rivalry among male bonobos for social hierarchy, according to Tokuyama et al. (2019), mating is predominantly influenced by the female selection of a mating partner and the social status of the male bonobo's mother. Such a logical approach to mating differs from chimps, who frequently exhibit aggression towards females. Conversely, female chimps seldom display aggression towards male chimps, which is one element that impacts the overall level of aggression in chimps. As per King (2021), aggression in chimpanzees is molded in early stages. Young chimpanzees become more aggressive when young chimps spend time with protective mothers and aggressive males (King, 2021). A similar inclination is discerned in humans: implying that aggressive behavior is more acceptable for boys leads to men being more physically aggressive. Hence, the persistent trend of male chimps displaying more aggression than female chimps reaffirms aggressive interactions among males.
Subsequently, another significant environmental contrast between bonobos that influenced their social structure and conditional gender equality is food availability. Greater social standing and physical prowess among chimpanzees imply more accessible food resources. Moreover, access to increased food resources ensures enhanced reproductive capacities and success. Conversely, Bonobos are less impacted by food availability as, according to Tokuyama et al. (2019), they inhabit regions with plentiful food supplies and low variability. Consequently, the physical might of bonobos plays a minor role as food is obtainable in quantities sufficient for multiple groups of bonobos, resulting in a relative equality between female and male bonobos. Furthermore, as bonobo mothers frequently engage in competitions alongside their sons, female bonobos are not marginalized like chimpanzee females.
Lastly, two types of aggression delineated in human evolution are proactive and reactive. Reactive aggression constitutes a response to instigation, while proactive aggression does not necessitate provocation and concentrates on devising a scheme in which the target will have minimal chances to retaliate (Wrangham, 2019a). Broadly speaking, humans are believed to be more akin to chimps, as they exhibit a proactive form of reaction, but humans also lean towards being less reactive than chimps, rendering them more akin to bonobos. It could be postulated that a diminished degree of reactive aggression in humans evolved through human evolution and self-domestication.
Comparing and evaluating the sources of aggression among chimpanzees and bonobos disclosed that environmental factors, such as food availability, dictated fundamental distinctions in social structure and aggression trends in chimps and bonobos. Consequently, concerning human evolution, aggression trends in individuals could be tied to environmental factors and the availability of resources. Historically, people tend to demonstrate more intense proactive aggression in combat and initiating wars for resources. This composition scrutinized why proactive aggression in chimps and humans shares similar rationales and provided a perspective on what human evolution would resemble if there were ample resources accessible for humankind.
