In 2014, Sony Pictures Entertainment encountered a cyber assault from North Korea before the launch of The Interview, a movie that examines the persona of North Korea’s dictator, Kim Jong Un. Apart from the digital attack that resulted in millions of losses for the corporation, Sony also faced a warning from the extremists that multiple cinemas planning to exhibit the movie would be targeted. Sony’s reaction to the warnings involved scrapping the movie’s release and transitioning to video-on-demand platforms. Some proposed that scrapping the movie’s launch establishes a perilous precedent of a sizable corporation complying with terrorist commands. Nonetheless, while the corporation’s resolution partly enabled them to defy the extremists’ directive, it also demonstrated how extremists’ schemes can be thwarted through technological progress.
In my viewpoint, Sony’s reaction was fitting for the circumstance, as it could be seen as the utilization of the adversary’s weapon against him. Consequently, while the extremists utilized cyber assaults to purloin the corporation’s data and ruin their equipment, Sony altered the release to on-demand avenues and streaming amenities, allowing a swift and extensive launch of the movie. As on-demand videos are simpler to pirate, the movie’s pirated duplicates swiftly disseminated throughout the internet, rendering the movie more accessible and widely discussed across various nations and demographics. Additionally, the movie’s storyline turned out to be more captivating as a comedy rather than satire, impacting the public’s perception regarding the prior threats from North Korea. In my opinion, Sony’s reaction to the assault was fitting for the situation and tactically tackled several worries.
Moreover, while the scenario is intricate by presenting an actual terrorist threat to the populace, there are certain actions that Sony and the U.S. government could have executed diversely to dissuade future such assaults on other U.S. establishments. Firstly, Sony never openly acknowledged that The Interview is a satire that has no affiliation with reality and does not challenge North Korea’s political system. Instead, it seemed that the corporation exploited unforeseen publicity to endorse a relatively trivial comedy movie. Hence, by originally postponing the movie’s release date, the corporation established an adverse precedent of a significant corporation succumbing to extremist requests.
Subsequently, contemplating the government’s role in Sony’s situation, the matter should have brought attention to the cyber security predicament in both governmental frameworks and large business entities. As opposed to recognizing that the predicament was Sony’s issue, assessing the violation and devising new cyber security protocols for the governmental establishments could have aided in averting other assaults in the future. For instance, it could have thwarted the 2016 dispute with foreign intervention in the presidential election (Stengel). Therefore, by concentrating on Sony’s financial losses rather than comparable potential threats in the future, the U.S. government uncovered the cyber security problems that contributed to forthcoming cyber assaults.
In conclusion, the instance of Sony’s response to the cyber assault illustrates the significance of prompt identification of the predicament and its repercussions. The scenario also demonstrates how an innovative strategy to a dilemma that concurrently addresses various concerns is not always the correct selection. Furthermore, preventing both real-world terrorist aggression and cyber assaults necessitates a joint endeavor of the U.S. government and business entities. The plausible actions incorporate regulation of governmental and private entities’ cyber security to attain higher data protection standards. Through collective endeavors and adequate financing, entities can devise more sophisticated cyber security and monitoring systems and implement them swiftly, preventing future real-world terrorist aggression and cyber assaults.
