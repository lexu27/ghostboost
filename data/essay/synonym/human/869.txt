Any plentiful biological species have notable effects on the planet by consuming natural resources. Being quite well-liked as pets, dogs and cats are frequently examined with regard to their psychological impacts on humans, but their adverse environmental effects necessitate consideration as well. The essay aims to recapitulate these animals’ primary environmental impacts with a focus on food consumption, infectious disease, species’ survival, and global warming.
As tamed animals, cats and dogs integrate into the environment in unique ways. Animals residing with pet owners in urban areas form a new group of consumers that need food products in various price ranges, animal toys, grooming items, and other pet supplies (Ferguson, 2020). Without the necessity to hunt for smaller animals to survive, domestic dogs and cats that have outdoor access still require their predatory instincts to be fulfilled (Ferguson, 2020). One possibility is that it leads to the pointless killings of small birds and rodents, and the abandoned prey can lure dangerous disease-carrying animals, like city-dwelling rats. The scenario might differ for feral cats and dogs as they are compelled to feed from trash cans and defend their territory, which entails the transmission of infection and hostility towards animals and humans. Even the excrement of domestic and healthy dogs contains viruses and parasites that can enter water supply systems, thereby harming humans and aquatic life (Ferguson, 2020). Hence, the presence of dogs and cats cannot be disregarded concerning the global environment.
The impact of dogs and cats on the ecosystem as a whole is rather adverse. Primarily, the existence of free-roaming domestic pets is widely recognized as a mechanism of “human interference to native animal populations” (Morin et al., 2018, p. 2). Domestic cats actively participate in hunting and can even contribute to the extinction of rare species (Ferguson, 2020). When quantified, the damage related to hunting by cats is seven times greater than that from dogs (Morin et al., 2018). Nonetheless, dogs are less confined to human habitats, which could render their ecological impacts more widespread yet less observable (Morin et al., 2018). The role of cats in spreading protozoan parasites, leading to toxoplasmosis in humans, and even contaminating drinking water with the oocysts of Toxoplasma gondii is emphasized in contemporary studies (Morin et al., 2018). Hence, the transmission of infections presents another complex impact on the ecosystem.
In assessing the overall impacts of cats and dogs on the ecological system, particularly compared to other domesticated species, the patterns of food consumption and their consequences are pivotal. According to Okin’s (2017) recent study on energy usage, cats and dogs in the U.S. account for up to 30% of the environmental and ecological impacts of meat product consumption. Meat production is more energy-intensive and contributes to erosion to a higher degree compared to plant-based food (Okin, 2017). Considering this, cats and dogs unquestionably surpass many domesticated species with plant-based diets, like sheep, horses, or herbivorous rodents, in their detrimental effects on the ecosystem. Annually, the consumption of meat and animal products by cats and dogs leads to the emission of at least 64,000,000 tons of N 2 O and CH 4 , both of which have significant global warming potentials (Okin, 2017). Therefore, their impacts on air quality and greenhouse gas emissions are also substantial.
Lastly, both cats and dogs have a substantial impact on the environment and the ecosystem. As carnivorous species, they actively consume animal-derived products that necessitate considerable natural resources to be produced and contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. The hunting behaviors of these domesticated animals could impact the survival of native species, and parasites in their excrement can cause human illnesses and water pollution, making stray dogs and cats a source of risk.
