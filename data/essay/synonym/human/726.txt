Theodore Roosevelt was one of the youngest American presidents recognized for his progressive concepts and the aspiration to transform society, addressing the existing distrust and helplessness. The choice to advocate progressive concepts was not impulsive, and he viewed the movement as the opportunity to safeguard the genuine authority of humans (Roosevelt, 1912). The attributes of a progressive are the determination to advocate for social justice, attain well-being for all individuals, and enhance the environment in which individuals should flourish and develop. Being a progressive signifies being positive about every initiative and engaging in issue-solving processes. There is no necessity to conceal oneself or remain silent but to take action and become enthusiastic about changes and transformations.
Despite the inclination to endorse progressive ideas, there are also some instances of anti-progressives. Roosevelt (1912) labeled them the individuals with limited vision and little compassion. Anti-progressives are never moved by the errors or failures committed by other individuals (Roosevelt, 1912). Persons who are engrossed in their self-centeredness are not capable of appealing to conscience. All they can do is to endorse oppression and exploit reforms that cater to the leadersâ€™ advancement, not the public one. The activities varied from the exploitation of workers to the advancement of capitalism that restricted society and enforced restrictions on creativity and advancement.
Roosevelt desired to instill faith in his ideas and objectives in people. Therefore, he portrayed progressivism as the movement that aimed to underscore the genuine regulations and liberties of society. It was about time to dispense justice and equality by clarifying the importance of authority and progress. By following his principles, numerous accomplishments can be disclosed, encompassing the capacity to elect leaders through transparent and unrestricted voting. Dealing with the realms of politics, social well-being, and decision-making significance, progressives can prosper as the movement and Roosevelt as the frontrunner. Once individuals evaluate their alternatives, they can devise policies and regulations to enhance various facets of their life.
