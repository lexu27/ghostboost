The physician’s task is to adhere to moral principles, including fidelity to patients and regard for their decision. Nonetheless, the occupation focuses on philosophical, spiritual, and cultural customs and convictions. Doctor-assisted suicide might be perceived as voluntary passing by a medical expert. Simultaneously, the physician furnishes all essential resources and details concerning the patient’s wishes for the conclusion of life. Nevertheless, such collaboration from a physician cannot be ethically mandated.
Permitting euthanasia can result in permanent harm to the patient if executed improperly. Consequently, an individual might be deprived of the chance for a familiar existence. Even though many patients opting for death suffer from untreatable illnesses willingly, the physician cannot aid them. In this instance, the ethical rule that a person cannot end someone else’s life is breached (Clarke et al., 2021). Furthermore, doctor-assisted suicide is entirely at odds with the description of a vocation aimed at aiding individuals. The physician is perceived as a mender, whereas physician-assisted suicide appears not to govern and assess the dangers, which could jeopardize numerous patients.
The predicament is rooted in the Hippocratic pledge taken by all physicians, one of the elements of which is to refrain from causing harm. Hence, aiding a patient with a desire for death may be considered a purposeful intent to harm the individual. Additionally, it might diminish the trust level between patients and medical personnel since ending a life cannot be ethically validated. Additionally, the religious perspective prohibits physicians from assisting patients at life's end, citing the directive against taking a life. Moreover, killing could be deemed objectionable due to society's ethical stance. The patient's suffering can be eased with the aid of accessible medications, whereas the loss of life is an irreversible action.
