The examination of which rhetorical tools public figures utilize in their discourse can be a advantageous aspect to explore. With its assistance, individuals can gain an understanding of how, when, and where individuals can utilize rhetorical elements. This endeavor aims to analyze Michelle Obama’s opening statements at the White House Convention on Food Marketing to Children. The primary point of the First Lady was to bring attention to the suppression of the promotion of unhealthy food to minors. Additionally, the primary appeals that Obama employs are reasoning and sentimental.
The initial facet of rhetoric utilized in this discourse is reasoning. It suggests the validation and causes for a specific action or occurrence. Michele Obama affirmed that “between 2008 and 2011, obesity rates among low-income preschoolers declined in 19 states and territories across the nation” (Read Michelle Obama’s Speech on Food Marketing para. 10). Consequently, Obama presents a validation of how significant it is for television transformations to promote a proper lifestyle among the younger generation.
The subsequent valuable element of rhetoric in the examined discourse of the first lady is the sentimental aspect. Thus, Obama stresses that “while we have made significant progress, when one in three kids is still on track to develop diabetes, and when the diet has now surpassed smoking” (Read Michelle Obama’s Speech on Food Marketing para. 11). In this instance, Michele Obama indicates the favorable outcomes already accomplished while also underscoring that children are still at risk.
In conclusion, this endeavor was involved in scrutinizing Michelle Obama’s discourse on the subject of the detriment of the media for introducing the younger generation to healthy habits. To more effectively convey the core concept, the first lady utilized such elements of rhetoric as reasoning and emotion. They aided in better shaping and delivering important information, provided the discourse with coherence, and enhanced the audience’s capacity to convince.
