Commencement
Managerial bookkeeping involves assessing and communicating the financial activities of an enterprise. It is crucial for the decision-making and planning of any organization and society. Executives primarily rely on the information provided by this model for prediction, operational control, and performance assessment. For example, managers utilize this data to determine what to manufacture, create, and when to manufacture. Hence, it is beneficial to them in ascertaining various costs involved in the production process and the necessary resources to achieve the company’s goals.
Moreover, the managerial accounting system is monetary in nature. Therefore, it integrates into the financial accounting system, particularly in the product costing system, which is essential in calculating the cost of sales used in the income statement and inventory cost used in the balance sheets. Arguably, this data can be viewed as the foundation for the outstanding management and operation of large organizations. Thus its preparation should be done monthly or quarterly and provided to the various managers, including the chief financial officers, for effective execution of their responsibilities. This document, thus, aims to generate a comprehensive report and examination of the real financial performance vis-a-vis the budgeted performance to be presented to the chief financial officer.
Synopsis
The actual net profit of 1036.8 demonstrates that the company is in good operation and can secure financing and investments. However, the budgeted net profit is 153.9 higher due to the lower sales volume in the actual performance. This then signals the sales and marketing department to adjust their marketing strategy to prevent the sales lag that is hindering the company from achieving its plans. Conversely, comparing the actual and budgeted net profit margins, the 15.88 % profit margin indicates that the company earns 15.88 cents for every dollar it collects instead of £15.71 that was budgeted (Maheshwari, Maheshwari, and Maheshwari, 2021). This indicates that the company is operating optimally and is highly capable of meeting its objectives. This examination, therefore, deems it fitting for the company to attempt to reduce the cost of sales to generate higher profit margins. Consequently, the company is required to minimize the selling costs and increase its sales volume to continue earning higher returns. Similarly, in the examination of this data, the liquidity ratio is also crucial to review as it determines whether the company can settle current debt obligations.
The liquidity ratio illustrates that the company is relatively in a good position to clear its current debts without using the inventory financing method, which is the least liquid. Its quick ratio of 0.8 indicates that it has £0.81 of liquid assets without inventory to cover £1 liability (Maheshwari, Maheshwari, and Maheshwari, 2021). Although the company aims to achieve 1.02, it is not close to insolvency. With all these analyses, it is logical to argue that the company is in good operation for the foreseeable future.
