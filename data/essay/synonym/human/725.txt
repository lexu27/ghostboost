Daniel R. Spanjer deliberates on which tools are the most valuable to utilize in the initial contemplation of the world around. Spanjer observes that humans "are neither simply products of the natural world nor completely restricted by it" (3). Consequently, ethical guidelines were established by God to steer the free will of individuals. In this context, Christians must delve into the religious perspective to comprehend how the world around them functions. Consequently, the exploration of Christianity forms the foundation for contemplating the Liberal Arts (2). Scrutinizing God and his engagement with humans is crucial both for grasping the current world and for its evolution in the future.
The cosmos comprises three fundamental spheres, which, through interaction with one another, shape the intricate world. These encompass the physical, logical, and human spheres, each with its own components (Spanjer 10-13). Furthermore, each of the aforementioned domains of the cosmos's operation is regulated by its individual laws. As part of the study of Liberal Arts, learners must take a holistic view of facets from each of these spheres and fathom how they collaborate.
Therefore, the central concept of this chapter is the necessity to comprehend the regulations of the subject of examination. Spanjer accentuates that understanding the mechanism of a specific sphere is unattainable while disregarding its inherent laws. This perspective, within the sphere of exploring Christianity, appears to be the most efficient as it enables the amalgamation of pondering the human core and ethics into a broader framework. In this instance, it is vital to recognize that individuals are also components of a larger system. Engaging in Liberal Arts enables individuals to organize knowledge about the world based on their tiers and interconnections.
