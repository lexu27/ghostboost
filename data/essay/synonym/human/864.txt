Care ethics theory was thoroughly criticized based on the concept of slave morality. This idea was developed by Nietzsche and asserts that marginalized individuals often develop the mindset that allows them to perceive their coerced servant behavior as a form of virtuous conduct (Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, n.d.). Thus, the inclination and willingness to provide care are perceived not as a positive attribute but as a form of inferiority that merely reinforces subjugation.

Another critique of care ethics revolves around the idea that rendered assistance is frequently insular. Specifically, the caretakers prioritize their relatives, acquaintances, and the inhabitants of their nation over other individuals in need who are geographically distant from the established aid facilities (Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, n.d.). Consequently, the critics argue that caregivers exhibit a tendency towards selectivity, extending their services solely to the local privileged class.

The juxtaposition of rationality and sentiment is crucial for comprehending care ethics. As Held (1997) asserts, “a genuinely universal … moral theory would be one that would take into consideration the experiences and concerns of women as comprehensively as it does those of men” (p. 99). She contends that care ethics should encompass the emotional dimension within moral principles, not solely relying on the conventional rationality of Kantian Imperative and Utilitarianism.

Additionally, the delineation between public and private domains and the ethical behaviors deemed appropriate are integral to care ethics. In Held's work (1997), it is mentioned that “gender bias has skewed previous notions of these domains, and we [feminists] are endeavoring to provide more fitting interpretations of ‘private’ morality and ‘public’ life” (p. 102). This excerpt emphasizes the interconnectedness of the public and private realms. Individuals are encouraged to behave consistently across both spheres without perpetuating gender stereotypes concerning the inherent conduct within these contexts.
