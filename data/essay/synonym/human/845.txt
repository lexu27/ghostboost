The primary distinction concerning various gender hypotheses is how they elucidate the gendered disparities in actions characteristic for both genders. When applied to the matter of behavioral issues in males, diverse theories identify their origins in various origins. Biological determinism would elucidate behavioral problems in male pupils through the notion of male nature as inherently and naturally competitive, aggressive, and even violent (Tilling, 2013). Nevertheless, this essentialist theory contradicts the now well-established recognition that, while some individuals are inclined toward delinquency, societal influences are a much more prominent cause thereof (Delcea et al., 2019). In opposition to biological determinism, the social establishment of gender theory posits that individuals perform gendered actions as they acquire them from others and internalize gender norms predominant in their societies (Tilling, 2013). This method would elucidate the correlation between the male gender and behavioral problems through Western cultures' promotion of aggressive notions of masculinity, going to the extent of endorsing bullying (Rosen and Nofziger, 2019). In essence, the crucial distinction between gender theories elucidating behavioral issues in males is where they seek for solutions.
Being informed about and comprehending these gender theories is plainly pertinent for teaching in multiple ways. Above all, it is nearly impossible to effectively tackle behavioral issues without comprehending their origin. Secondly, and also significantly, gender theories that are long out of favor in the scientific community may still exert considerable influence over the public. An instance would be the mythopoetic menâ€™s movement that heavily relies on biological determinism despite all criticisms of the latter (Tilling, 2013). Hence, enhanced knowledge of gender theories is also critical for the comprehension of the manners in which individuals can justify their actions.
