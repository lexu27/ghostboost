President Franklin Roosevelt did much to end the Great Slump, which included passing acts and laws. They were aimed not only at restoring the economy and infrastructure but also at improving the situation of certain groups of the population. They include immigrants, African Americans, and worker, creating health clinics, special courses, college buildings, new schools, and recreation facilities, thus, increasing their quality of life. The first act I would like to analyze is the creation of the Public Works Administration (PWA ). It was a Federal American Agency created during the New Deal by President Franklin President franklin roosevelt (Corbett, 2014 ). This act not only put up to recreation from the Great Depression but also provided workers, immigrants, and African Americans with workplaces and necessary social infrastructure. The act was specialized in building and public works, which formulated an improvement in the industrial field as well. The next act I have chosen to consider is Agricultural Adjustment Act (AAA ). This act focused on the improvement of agricultural fields by providing farmers who decreased their land compensation (Week 6 Lesson, 2022 ). Thus, the president managed not only to engage multitude to participate in the agricultural spectrum but also promoted improvement of the African American, immigrants, and workers conditions. It helped farmers as prices for corps raised; thus, the business became more profitable. However, at that place was another side to the coin as people had to pay more money to buy it. In my opinion, the New Deal made a significant contribution to the recovery from the Great Depression. There were create many agencies aimed at the improvement of different fields. Moreover, the government attempted to control wages and prices and established many programs for vulnerable population layers and unemployed people.
