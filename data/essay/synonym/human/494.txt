President Franklin Roosevelt accomplished a great deal in putting an end to the Great Depression, which involved enacting acts and statutes. They were targeted not just at reviving the economy and infrastructure but also at enhancing the circumstances of specific segments of the society. These encompassed migrants, African Americans, and laborers, establishing healthcare centers, unique courses, university structures, fresh educational institutions, and recreational amenities, thereby enhancing their standard of living.
The initial act I would like to assess is the establishment of the Public Works Administration (PWA). It was a Federal American Agency established during the New Deal by President Franklin Roosevelt (Corbett, 2014). This statute not only aided recovery from the Great Depression but also granted employment and essential social infrastructure to laborers, migrants, and African Americans. The statute was specialized in construction and civic projects, which led to an enhancement in the industrial sector as well.
The subsequent statute I have opted to examine is the Agricultural Adjustment Act (AAA). This statute concentrated on the enhancement of agricultural sectors by supporting farmers who reduced their land payments (Week 6 Lesson, 2022). Thus, the president not only succeeded in encouraging people to engage in the agricultural domain but also advanced the conditions of African Americans, migrants, and laborers. It supported farmers as crop prices increased; as a result, businesses became more profitable. Nonetheless, there was a downside as consumers had to pay more money to purchase it.
In my view, the New Deal made a substantial contribution to the recovery from the Great Depression. Numerous agencies were established to enhance various sectors. Furthermore, the government sought to regulate salaries and costs and implemented several programs for disadvantaged population segments and jobless individuals.
