Introduction
Scholars globally have been researching the notion of backpacking tourism for an extended period, broadening the current understanding about this domain. Nonetheless, backpacking as a phenomenon is continuously evolving, leading to fresh iterations and patterns. Fundamentally, the requirements and aspirations of the contemporary backpacker differ from those that were pertinent a decade ago. Consequently, there is a need to examine the current scenario and investigate the new trends favored among the members of the backpacking community. Awareness of the most current trends in the field of backpacking can be crucial for various sectors, particularly the lodging industry. Hence, the present study concentrates on identifying the most recent trends in the realm of backpacking tourism and pinpointing ways they can be embraced by hospitality enterprises. Nevertheless, to carry out high-quality research, it is essential to scrutinize the existing scholarly literature on the subject of backpacking and hospitality. The ongoing literature examination will emphasize three primary research aims: establishing the appeal of backpacking for younger generations, pinpointing hostels’ strategies for enhancing travelers’ experiences, and evaluating strategies for the enduring sustainability of backpacking trends.
Objective 1: Backpacking and Younger Generations
Backpacking is a relatively recent phenomenon that surfaced a few decades ago, which clarifies the shortage of scholarly inquiry on the subject in the 20th century. The notion of wanderer-tourism introduced by Cohen (1973) in the 1970s was one of the initial efforts of researchers to delve into the subject of unconventional tourism. The concept of wanderer-tourism denoted a minimally institutionalized form of tourism, marked by a significant degree of independence (1973). Wanderers delineated by Cohen can be seen as the forerunners of contemporary backpackers since they both exhibit the traits of autonomy. Simultaneously, today, backpacking can be perceived as formalized tourism and has already entrenched itself as one of the traditional methods of travel. Furthermore, as per Cohen (1973), were predominantly affluent young individuals seeking novel life experiences. Current backpackers encompass individuals of all ages, although the younger cohort remains predominant. Additionally, since backpacking has evolved into an institutionalized form of travel, numerous individuals regard it as a lifestyle (Cohen, 2011). According to Cohen’s investigation (2011, p. 1535), several backpackers portray their pursuits as their lifestyle and self-identify as "lifestyle travelers." Essentially, backpacking has evolved into a trend highly favored within the tourist community to the extent where certain individuals regard it as their core vocation.
