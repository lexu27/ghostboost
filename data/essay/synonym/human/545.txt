The establishment legends of Rome epitomize some of the characteristics crucial for a prosperous state in antiquity – determination, aggressiveness, and political and societal adaptability. Historians of various kinds have been attempting to comprehend and explain the tale of Romulus and Remus since its inception. The subsequent phases of Rome’s alleged history also provoke numerous inquiries concerning fratricide, kidnapping, violation, and also the origins of Rome’s initial inhabitants. The notion that in accordance with most of the legends, Rome originated from fratricide appears to be rather pertinent given that the city’s past is famously marked by civil conflicts and battles. Numerous historians endeavored to gloss over this incident – Cicero disregarded it, Dionysius of Halicarnassus portrayed Romulus as full of remorse, and Egnatius proposed that Remus had survived and outlived Romulus (as mentioned in Beard, 2015). Another Roman historian – Livy – recounted the narrative of Romulus reacting to his brother’s deeds, thus depicting the city’s founder as a tough, warlike, but fairly equitable individual (as referenced in Beard, 2015). Regardless of the analyses, it appears that aggression, determination, and readiness to promptly settle both internal and external disputes with blood were reflected in Roman legends and history.

Conversely, the past of Rome is the chronicle of unparalleled openness, inclusivity, and social mobility. The detail that the majority of initial Roman inhabitants purportedly were offenders may cast a disagreeable shade on the city’s heritage, yet ultimately, this resulted in more accessible political and societal structures. Unlike other nations of the old world, Rome not only embraced outsiders but also assimilated them into its community, gradually granting citizenship to the inhabitants of territories (Beard, 2015). One of the rulers of Macedon in the third century BCE acknowledged the benefits of the Roman strategy (as mentioned in Beard, 2015). Without much uncertainty, it can be assumed that Roman establishment legends are intimately connected with the Roman identity, and it is feasible to pinpoint some of Rome’s success elements through its myths.
