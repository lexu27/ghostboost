Introduction
Endurance is among the rapidly expanding moral concerns for individuals, businesses, and governments. According to Mason (2022), “endurance considers how we might live in harmony with the natural world around us, safeguarding it from harm and ruin.” This indicates that endurance is where individuals can maintain themselves without damaging the planet. Consequently, the endurance notion that resonates with me is diminishing the influence of climate change. The notion is connected to my aspiration to be a climate change advocate. It also links to my objective of becoming an environmentalist. Hence, everyone plays a role in advancing endurance to enhance the planet for everyone, including upcoming generations.
Endurance
Endurance is a modern notion that promotes contemplation of ways to live in harmony with nature. It can be described as achieving our needs without compromising future generations’ ability to fulfill their own (Mason, 2022). In my perspective, endurance is focused on how we should live in harmony with our natural world and protect it from harm and ruin for future generations. In other words, it encompasses existing and evolving without exhausting the accessible natural resources for posterity. It also means operating efficiently for everyone because all the deeds we execute impact the future. For instance, enduring organic pollutants can have unfavorable consequences such as an extension of species and harm to the ecosystem. This implies that the environment will not be favorable for the approaching generations.
The primary things that sustain me are air, water, and food in the natural world. Although human beings can survive without food for some days, death is possible if it is prolonged. Food is essential for human survival as it is the origin of nutrients that supply energy for activity, growth, and all bodily functions. Water is also a vital component for human survival. It is impossible for humans to exist without water. However, contaminated water is detrimental to humans and can be a cause of illness. Besides water and food, I also require quality air to survive. This means that the air I inhale should be free from pollutants. Hence, I need quality air, water, and food to subsist on Earth.
Personal Understanding of Endurance in My Life
The endurance aspect that is pertinent to me is lessening climate change impacts. According to United Nations (2021), sustainable Development Goal 13 aims to “take immediate action to combat climate change and its impact.” It is about devising ways or solutions to decrease the planet’s climate impact. Decreasing the impact of climate change, also known as climate change mitigation, involves evading and lowering greenhouse gas emissions into the environment to prevent the planet from heating up to high temperatures (Ahmed et al., 2019). Additionally, it requires a transition from fossil fuels to clean, renewable energy. This is critical as it aids in preventing deforestation and reinstating natural habitats until carbon emissions are reduced to zero. Therefore, lessening the impact of climate change involves engaging in actions that avert climate change from occurring.
The endurance aspect of lessening the impact of climate change is crucial as it helps alleviate the consequences of climate change on the planet. Climate change is a substantial issue as it has the potential to induce hazardous shifts in climate and weather (Ahmed et al., 2019). For instance, many regions have witnessed alterations in rainfall, leading to a rise in floods, droughts, and intense rainfalls and an escalation in the frequency and severity of heatwaves. Given this, this aspect furnishes vital strategies to help diminish the adverse effects of climate change. Moreover, it presents diverse approaches to reducing climate change at an individual, family, community, organization, country, and global level. For instance, an individual is encouraged to monitor their carbon footprint.
Lessening the impacts of climate change like other aspects of endurance aims to attain sustainability. The primary objective is to enhance the planet for everyone, including future generations. As people decrease the impacts of climate change, they establish a favorable environment for all. For instance, diminishing our carbon footprint reduces the volume of pollutants in the environment. The aspect also correlates with others, such as establishing affordable and clean energy. For example, when people transition from fossil fuel vehicles to electric ones, they decrease harmful emissions into the environment. Additionally, establishing sustainable cities, which involves investing in public transportation and creating green public spaces, shares a common objective of bettering the world.
This notion is directly relevant to my life and my vision of becoming an environmentalist. I comprehend that everyone on Earth is susceptible to the effects of climate change. Despite the impact of climate change, individuals are sluggish in adopting the recommended climate change mitigations. We can commence making changes by introspecting and contemplating what we can do to change, such as refraining from littering and endeavoring to decrease our use of pollutants. We can also start encouraging others to do the same in order to maintain a healthy environment. These actions are all part of the grand turning point, as we urge others to assist in safeguarding our citizens and the future of our planet. Thus, lessening the effects of climate change aligns with my lifelong ambition of becoming an environmentalist.
During childhood, I nurtured a desire to partake in the preservation of the environment following a news report. One day, while watching the news collectively as a family, there was disturbing news of heatwaves in Europe. It claimed the lives of thousands of people in Europe. This was the moment I directly associated climate change with the deaths of people. From that moment, I harbored a desire to learn more and discuss climate change to mitigate deaths and diseases caused by climate change. Consequently, the notion of lessening the impact of climate change resonates with my ambition of safeguarding the environment. Additionally, the notion informs me that I can alter the way I live and lessen the impacts of climate change. Hence, I reinforced my desire to aid in protecting the environment when I acquired more knowledge about climate change mitigation strategies.
Connections to Active Hope
After perusing the Earth Charter, sustainable development goals, and endurance definitions, I discovered that I connect most with lessening the impact of climate change. I resonate most with this notion because I believe that the primary adversary of endurance is climate change. People are enduring due to the fluctuations in temperature and weather patterns induced by climate change. I also believe that it is unfeasible to attain anticipated endurance if we are still encountering climate change. Therefore, the significance of this notion is to awaken everyone to the fact that we need to opt to implement the proposed ways of diminishing climate change. This includes altering our mindset about our environment and making the right decisions.
A Connection to the Great Turning
The Great Turning can be assimilated into my daily life by embracing the suggested climate change mitigation strategies. Macy and Johnstone (2012) posit “right now a shift of comparable scope and magnitude is occurring. It’s been called the Ecological Revolution, the Sustainability Revolution, even the Necessary Revolution” (39). This implies that people should be prepared for a revolution to attain endurance. Therefore, the notion of lessening climate change demands that I depart from the status quo and embrace the new paradigm of sustainable operations.
A Connection to Seeing with New Eyes
Seeing with New Eyes is a pivotal notion in the promotion of endurance. It presents a viewpoint that I can derive new vigor by recognizing that I am part of a flow of life that commenced billions of years ago. Macy and Johnstone (2012) state, “He experienced himself
