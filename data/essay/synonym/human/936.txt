In the contemporary era, digital currency garners increasing attention from individuals worldwide. Despite not yet being prevalent among the public, digital currency is utilized by a substantial number of financial establishments and corporations for its capacity to impact the financial market in the time to come. Broadly speaking, it can be described as a virtual or electronic currency safeguarded by cryptography – which is the reason it cannot be duplicated or forged. There exist presently numerous digital currencies, with most of them being decentralized networks based on blockchain technologies enforced by computer networks. Digital currency is immune to governmental manipulation or intervention since it is not issued by it or any central authority.
The importance of this exploration is established by an unidentified and contentious consequence of digital currency. While it is frequently seen as a more convenient and secure substitute for traditional money, some specialists argue that the volatility of digital currency will have a disastrous effect on numerous sectors in the future (Nova, 2021). Hence, the investigation and assessment of its potential impact will be advantageous for devising precise strategies and preventive actions. The aim of this manuscript is to scrutinize the essence of digital currency, its attributes, and influence through a review of literature to address the research query: Is digital currency unstable? The response will aid in affirming or refuting a hypothesis embedded in the paper’s thesis statement – as an enduring unregulated bubble, digital currency contributes to financial and monetary instability, a lack of investor safeguarding, the collapse of the global market, and wealth disparity.
As per prior investigations, an electronic currency can be seen as an exceedingly convenient substitute for traditional money shielded from government oversight. It cannot be duplicated or forged, and its utilization is frequently depicted as the future of the financial market. Nonetheless, this analysis incorporating accessible data concerning digital currency reveals its volatility that could pose profoundly adverse outcomes for diverse sectors. According to contemporary research, digital currency constitutes a sustained bubble whose valuation is synthetically generated. Without adequate supervision, the fluctuations in its worth might result in significant challenges in the financial market and exacerbate wealth disparities. In the future, a more comprehensive juxtaposition of digital currency and traditional money concerning the mechanism of its regulation might be necessary to corroborate the outcomes of this manuscript.
