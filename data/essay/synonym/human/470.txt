The COVID-19 epidemic was an abrupt and frightening ordeal for all individuals globally. I recall informing my companions that the virus would not persist for an extended period and that we would all reunite following two weeks of self-isolation. I was unaware of how extensive its impact would be and the alterations it would introduce to my life. Remaining at home and observing the reports about millions of affected and deadly instances made me recognize how delicate human life is. The outbreak has both favorable and unfavorable consequences on individuals and their enterprises. This document discusses these consequences and presents my encounter with the COVID-19 healthcare emergency.
The virus that is still ongoing has taught a valuable lesson for all of us, which is the ability to adjust to swiftly changing situations. You will never anticipate what lies ahead, and you must be adaptable and composed enough to accept the new reality. Initially, during the epidemic, it was enjoyable to stay at home, view TV programs, and converse with my friends. However, after a while, I realized how my mental well-being was deteriorating as I began to experience apprehension about the world and my future. I also empathized deeply with individuals who lost their loved ones due to COVID. Nevertheless, I somehow coped with that pressure through mental health assistance, podcasts, and books. I recognized that being able to adapt to a shifting reality is the sole approach to continue daily routines. On a national scale, nations were also adjusting and formulating new regulations, and I believe now many political figures are more adaptable, acknowledging sudden changes. There were numerous errors to grasp the significance of efficient and prompt decisions that consider the present reality.
Another positive aspect of the epidemic is that individuals learned the importance of family and socialization. People cannot exist alone, and they necessitate someone to depend on and care for. Throughout the epidemic, I was with my family, and I believe it was the first time interacting with them so intimately. We deliberated the situation and exchanged personal concerns frequently, allowing me to comprehend my family better and provide them with support. I also felt anxious about elderly family members, realizing that I did not value the time spent with them before the outbreak. It prompted me to reassess my family bonds and acknowledge that they are my loved ones, and I should devote more time to them. I presume this was a valuable lesson for everyone, and I trust people will cherish their families and look after them.
One of the fundamental changes that the COVID-19 epidemic brought to us is online education. I was uncertain how to evaluate such type of education as beneficial or detrimental as there are numerous arguments for each side. Personally, I favored the online method of learning because I could also enroll in other courses offered for free by various universities and platforms like Coursera. I also acquired the skill to manage time effectively as the increased workload compelled me to do so. Nonetheless, many students disliked online education as we struggled to concentrate on our studies. Individuals live in diverse circumstances, some of us lacked personal space for studying while others lacked time for education. Education is undeniably a privilege, but the online format exacerbated it. Furthermore, I heard that in certain regions, students climbed trees to access the Internet and complete their assignments.
The COVID-19 emergency heightened inequality worldwide and had an adverse effect on the global economy. Individuals in developing nations lacked adequate healthcare services and tools for remote work and study. Many individuals lost their employment, unable to support their families. These circumstances elevated crime rates, unemployment rates, and worldwide hunger, placing numerous nations in a challenging socio-economic position. Additionally, the virus divided individuals into two factions of advocates for vaccination and those who oppose it. This schism among individuals triggered social unrest, transforming the healthcare crisis into an ideological battle. People fabricated tales about the COVID-19 and failed to contribute to resolving the epidemic. In my view, such a reaction from the public is anticipated as the general populace sought answers that government officials did not possess. Consequently, the government must be extremely cautious about how it communicates with citizens.
In general, there is much to discuss regarding the repercussions of Covdi-19. For me, it was an episode of tending to my mental well-being and being near my family. For the world, it has resulted in disrupted economies, heightened inequality, and loss of lives. I trust the crisis prompted individuals to reconsider their lives and be supportive of others. I also believe that the world will not be identical following the termination of COVID-19 if it indeed concludes.
