The Soul bear of the British Colony is a distinctive species of bears that astonish with their appearance and are of special significance to the population of British Columbia. This breed of animal is a type of Kermode bear and is a subspecies of black bears, which often have dark fur (Service, 2017). However, because of a genetic mutation, some of the individuals of spirit bears have a white coat color, which is why they bear such an intriguing name (Langlois, 2017). Like many members of this species, they weigh an average of two hundred kilograms (Service, 2017). Many sources highlight the extreme scarcity of this breed of bear and only estimated about four hundred types in British Columbia, which determines the necessity to conserve them (Groc, n.d.). Additionally, it is believed that they are closely connected to the indigenous population of America, as they contribute to the development of the ecosystem in which they reside, which makes them exceedingly important. The indigenous population also has a myth that spirit bears could swim deep underwater and transport people to a magical place. Spirit bears can frequently be found in the Great Bear Rainforest, with nearly seven million hectares of rainforest (Langlois, 2017). Another characteristic of these animals is a specific fondness for salmon. Moreover, bears consume berries, insects, plants, fruits, and nuts (Service, 2017). Kermodes are also highly timid and mysterious, which further complicates the task of locating them and the rarity of encountering humans. In conclusion, Spirit bears are uncommon representatives of bears who, because of their unique white color, are regarded as sacred and revered by the indigenous population of America.
