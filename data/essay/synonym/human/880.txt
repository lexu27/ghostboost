Title: Preamble
Antibiotics operate against bacteria in various ways by either obstructing metabolic pathways, nucleic acid production, protein synthesis, depolarizing cell membrane, or inhibiting the cell wall production. By utilizing these techniques, antibiotics can impede bacterial growth or eradicate it. Nevertheless, as antibiotics function against bacteria, they have been portrayed to leave behind resistant strains that reproduce naturally (Reygaert, 2018). Antibiotic resistance arises when germs such as bacteria and fungi persist in growing by developing the capacity to overcome drugs designed to eliminate them (Singer et al., 2003; Toerien, 1967). Occasionally, it is impracticable and challenging to manage infections caused by antibiotic-resistant germs (Foti et al., 2011; Fair & Tor, 2014). Patients who have these infections necessitate extended medical stays, follow-ups, and costly alternatives before achieving positive outcomes.
Microorganisms from the unidentified samples are crucial to recognize to avert harmful and advantageous bacteria in this society. The issue of antibiotic resistance has expanded globally and has a more substantial impact on impoverished and developing nations than developed nations (Ventola, 2015; Waxman, & Strominger, 1983). Due to the simplicity with which antibiotics can be acquired in many of these countries without a prescription, the developed world predominantly relies on prescriptions (Alanis, 2005). According to Falagas and Bliziotis (2007), polymyxins were the antibiotics that retained the highest activity against the three examined species of Gram-negative bacteria. Citrobacter freundii (C. freundii) is often resilient to numerous groups of antibiotics, indicating that both scientific and ecological strains may harbor antimicrobial resistance elements (Liu et al., 2018). Over the past years, there has been increased awareness of family Enterobacteriaceae due to its association with causing animal and human diseases (Stanic et al., 2015). Genus Hafnia has been linked to emerging antimicrobial resistance patterns and infections related to presenting unusual diseases and stem cells.
The laboratory techniques and procedures covered during this course were utilized to evaluate each student's practical comprehension of microbiology. The objective of this laboratory report is to recognize unknown organisms using genetic sequencing and traditional biochemical testing techniques on each isolated unknown that led to the identification of each unknown. It is also anticipated that C. freundii will have a more exceptional antibiotic resistance to each of the four tested antibiotics, including penicillin, doxycycline, polymyxin B, and rifampicin, than Hafnia alvei.
Approaches
Two unknown organisms labeled as #15 and #43 were provided on agar plates. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) was performed to identify the genus for both unknown organisms (#15 and #43). PCR involves a biochemical process that amplifies a single DNA molecule (BIOS 3120, 2021). It was used to find specific 16s rRNA genes present in unknown organisms by cross-referencing them with databases for known bacteria sequencing. PCR test involved materials such as Taq polymerase, a DNA template, PCR primers, nucleotides, inoculation loop, a flame, a micropipette, sterile water, and a PCR tube. A mix for loading in the PCR was made by adding 0.5µL of forward primer 8F, 0.5 µL of reverse primer 1492R, 1µL of the DNA template, 10.5 µL of sterile water, and 12.5 µL of master mix to a PCR tube. The tubes were then loaded in an Eppendorf Mastercycler Nexus Thermal Cycler Gradient programmed to start with 95 0 C for 10 minutes, 95 0 C for 1.5 minutes, 55 0 C for 1 minute, 72 0 C for 2 minutes, 72 0 C for 10 minutes, and a 10 0 C hold (Lab Manual, 2021).
The unknown organisms were streaked on the TSA broth and TSA plate by inoculating the loop over the flame and then transferring a loop bacterium into the slant on a zig-zag motion. The streaked organism was then incubated at 37 0 C until the next lap period to prepare the bacteria for biochemical tests. An analysis was made, and the samples were used to carry out six biochemical tests on each unknown bacterial culture. For unknown #43, the following tests were performed: gram stain, thioglycolate, oxidase, catalase, citrate, indole production, and ornithine-decarboxylase test. For unknown #15, the tests performed were gram stain, thioglycolate, oxidase, catalase, ONPG (B-galactosidase), and indole production.
Gram Stain
Gram stain is a laboratory technique used for determining the thickness of bacteria's peptidoglycan layer by labeling it either as thick peptidoglycan layer (gram-positive) or thin peptidoglycan layer (gram-negative). To perform gram staining, the material needed included clean microscope slides, staining trays, gram stain reagents, a water bottle for rinsing, and bacterial cultures. Gram stain test began with the bacterial smear at fixed heating on an inoculated slide containing a colony of bacteria culture in a small volume of water. The bacterial specimen was then air-dried followed by fixed heating underside for a few seconds. After completing heat-fixing, gram straining was performed on the bacterial smear.
The procedure for this biochemical test entailed, firstly, addition of crystal violate drops to the smear and then allowing it to settle for sixty seconds. The slide was then rinsed off; after this step, all the cells were purple. Secondly, a few drops of gram's iodine were added to the bacterial smear and then allowed to sit for sixty seconds before rinsing with water. Alcohol was added as a decolorizer and left to run over the slide surface for 7 seconds until no more crystal color came out of the bacterial smear. The slide was then rinsed with water to stop the decolorization process. It was noted that Gram-positive cells retain crystal violet and remain purple after adding decolorizer while gram-negative cells lose crystal violet and become colorless. Finally, a few drops of safranin were added on the slide as a counterstain then allowed to sit for one minute before rinsing off. The results were then analyzed by putting and observing the slide color under a microscope. Bacterial growth at 45 0 C was done by incubating the culture for 48 hours, and then observation was done on its growth.
Thioglycolate Test
In a bacterial experiment, a thioglycolate test was chiefly performed to ascertain bacterial oxygen requirement using thioglycolate broth that contained an oxygen gradient with higher levels at the top and no oxygen at the bottom. When conducting this test, the material required included a thioglycolate tube with resazurin indicator and bacterial cultures #43 and #15 (Beaman et al., 2007). A thioglycolate tube was inoculated with the organism
