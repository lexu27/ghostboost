Both appearance bias and radical body alteration are inherently connected to unhealthy and unrealistic beauty standards of contemporary society. This characteristic aside, however, the two are very distinct in their expressions and direct outcomes. Appearance bias is simply the act of evaluating someone whose look is not what most individuals would consider beautiful. It concentrates on displaying adverse judgment towards individuals who do not meet the norm and is thus focused outside the individual who practices it. Radical body alteration is the act of modifying one’s body to appear in a manner that deviates from the standards that society establishes for appearance (Good, 2016). In contrast, one does not appear aesthetically pleasing, while the other purposefully distinguishes oneself in ways that others would view as deviations or contrary to societal norms.

The distinctions between the two arise from their external or internal perspectives, despite both being associated with discontent about appearance. It is probable that an individual who engages in appearance bias is profoundly insecure about their own beauty and therefore adopts a critical position towards the beauty of others. Fixation on other people’s characteristics or grooming practices typically indicates a very unhealthy connection with self-image, even though it is less noticeable than physical alterations (Good, 2016). Meanwhile, such alterations can occur either voluntarily by an individual or as a result of societal pressure or tradition. An instance of the latter would be an ancient Chinese practice of binding women's feet to make them small and delicate in shape. Frequently, the expectations of radical bodily modifications are imposed on women, who are anticipated to adhere to them in certain societies to maintain their respectability and perceived marital worth.
