COVID-19 prevention oversight and vaccine allocation have been some of the most debated subjects over the past year. The United States has been impacted more severely than most nations, and it is crucial to provide efficient measures against the virus transmission. Based on these considerations, many specialists argue that the Federal government should have procured and dispersed more examination kits and vaccines. Currently, Biden acknowledges the pandemic issue but underscores the significance of the States, "There is no federal resolution. This is addressed at a state level" (Franck, 2021, para. 5). In essence, government engagement could only hinder further pandemic transmission with the suitable state backing and collaboration from civilians. The majority of specialists acknowledge the efficacy of vaccines, particularly in alleviating the symptoms of the variant (WHO, 2022). Hence, a resolution solely at the Federal level would probably have minimal impact, and it is crucial to enhance public consciousness regarding the risks of COVID-19 and the advantages of vaccination.
Regarding Biden's comment on the unforeseen emergence of COVID-19 in late 2021, I somewhat concur with the remark. The Omicron variation, initially identified and termed on 26 November 2021, is a more transmissible strain than prior mutations (WHO, 2021). Consequently, Omicron triggered a significant surge in infection instances and prompted escalated demand for examination kits (UC Davis Health, 2022). Extensive research is necessary on the Omicron variant, and this development was relatively unanticipated. Nonetheless, the nation is far more equipped in 2022, in contrast to the initial phases of the pandemic, and Biden has pledged to procure 500 million test kits (BBC News, 2021). Ultimately, the Federal government, States, and populace should collaborate and unite efforts to impede the further progression of the Omicron variant.
