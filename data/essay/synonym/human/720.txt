The ruin and obstacles of World War II were immense. The U.S. encountered harsh and noteworthy goals that would shape the future state of America and European countries. It was crucial for the U.S. to resist Communist expansion in Europe and Asia, so there were specific strategies that targeted this objective, and assessing their effectiveness and triumph may offer valuable insights.
First, it is crucial to discuss the policy of containment that was embraced by America and its allies. The aim of this approach was to hinder the spread of communism and react to the Soviet Union’s actions to extend its influence in numerous countries by offering struggling nations with more funding (Corbett et al., 2014). It is conceivable to state that this strategy was efficient because the U.S. succeeded in shielding several countries from being pressured into communism.
The second triumphant policy is the Marshall Plan directed at several beneficial changes. The primary concept behind this strategy was to offer financial assistance to the struggling European nations, granting them $13 billion in economic aid (Corbett et al., 2014). The nations that obtained financial aid were unified and managed to undermine the political appeal of communism. The third relatively successful modification was the Vietnam conflict (“Domino theory,” 2018). In this war, South Vietnam and the U.S. opposed North Vietnam’s communist government (Corbett et al., 2014). Although the U.S. did not succeed in safeguarding South Vietnam from communist forces, its expansion to the rest of Southeast Asia was blocked, and it is plausible to deem this modification effective. Lastly, one would argue that the United States should not have dreaded international communist subversion during the Cold War era. The rationale is that America’s power enabled it to withstand communist forces, and the apprehension could have weakened the nation’s confidence.
