Robert Putnam argues that the United States has forfeited social capital and civil society over the past 25 years following an elucidation of the significance of social capital and civil society in democratic nations. Tocqueville, throughout his trip to America, proclaimed, "Americans of all ages, all stations in life, and all types of disposition are incessantly establishing associations. There exist not only commercial and industrial associations in which all participate, but others of myriad different kinds—religious, moral, solemn, pointless, very extensive and very restricted, exceedingly large and very minute.… Nothing, in my opinion, warrants more attention than the intellectual and moral associations in America" (Putmann, 2000, p. 65). Despite Putnam acknowledging that identifying the importance of some opposing trends without further investigation is challenging, he concludes that crucial elements such as social confidence are deteriorating rapidly in the United States. He then delves deeply into this decline, and he finalizes by delineating the inquiry needed to thoroughly explore these hypotheses.
This significant book illustrates that social capital has significantly dwindled in the United States after the mid-to-late-1960s due to generational shift, the ascent of television and urban expansion, and the escalating demands imposed on people's schedule and finances, among other factors. A range of social predicaments have stemmed from this, leading to poor educational results, economic strain, and conflicts amid social factions. The most feasible resolution to this predicament is to reinstate social capital akin to the Progressive Era but utilizing contemporary methodologies.
Cultural standards of reciprocity and dependability have evolved due to the aggregation of social capital, described as "connections among individuals' social networks." Social capital is considered to have equal significance as physical and human capital. Correspondingly, social networks are deemed to hold equal importance (Putnam, 2020, p. 19). As per the author of Bowling Alone, there has been a decrease in social capital in present-day America. The book explores the origins and repercussions of this decrease and plausible remedies.
Per Putnam, there is a pivotal contrast between social capital that links everyone and bonds that unite everyone, encompassing solely those individuals. Outward-facing networks, contrary to inward-facing networks primarily focused on their members, are more prone to incorporate more comprehensive social capital networks. Ethnic fraternal groups and social clubs exemplify this type of establishment today. Conversely, diverse social divides, also recognized as bridging social capital networks, are outward-facing and encompass individuals from various social backgrounds. The civil rights activism and youth service groups showcase how social capital has been utilized to bridge disparities in recent times.
The likelihood that social capital could curb freedom and equal prospects must be acknowledged for this endeavor to prosper. Because social capital is frequently effortlessly formulated when it stands in opposition to something or someone else. It is crucial to foster bonding social capital, which regrettably is much simpler to cultivate than other forms of social capital. It is indispensable for those facing oppression to construct connections of social capital to progress through amplified generalized norms of reciprocity to attain enhanced social mobility. Readers are urged to devise novel forms of social capital that are currently unavailable to fulfill Putnam's ultimate challenge.
