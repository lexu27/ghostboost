Allergic rhinitis is a sporadic or persistent inflammation of the mucous membrane of the upper respiratory tract, distinguished by nasal blockage, discharge, itching, sneezing, and a variety of potential symptoms. In this scenario, a 35-year-old patient presented with nasal blockage, eyelid swelling, conjunctival redness, allergic creases and sparkles, and inflamed nostrils, which validates her diagnosis (Seidman et al., 2015). A medical expert recognized some of the symptoms mentioned.
The hypersensitivity reaction is the primary kind since allergic rhinitis is defined by it. The allergen, upon entering the body for the first time, triggers the development of specific antibodies, immunoglobulins, which attach to the surface of mast cells. When a sensitized organism comes into contact again with an irritant, IgE-mediated activation of mast cells occurs (Hoyte & Nelson, 2018). This process triggers the release of histamine, heparin, and other inflammatory agents responsible for allergic reactions. Essentially, pathophysiology suggests that the initial exposure to the allergen stimulates the production of IgE by plasma cells.
Three personal deductions from this scenario are: the patient endures continuous sneezing, ponders the complication of infectious illnesses, and reports improvement when away from home in a different climate. An expert drew objective conclusions: firstly, eyelid swelling and allergic luster caused by venous swelling of the lower eyelid. In simpler terms, allergies lead to eye inflammation. Secondly, inflamed nostrils and an allergic crease indicate a persistent runny nose. Thirdly, the persistence of these indicators indicates the constant proximity of an irritant source.
Primarily, it is vital to undergo tests for irritants, which are collected via a swab from the nose. Following the results, treatment with antihistamines, corticosteroid nasal sprays, and decongestants is then recommended to alleviate congestion and symptoms (Hoyte & Nelson, 2018). Equally crucial are environmental management and nasal flushing (Schuler IV & Montejo, 2021). Ultimately, minimizing contact with recognized allergens as much as possible is essential. In this instance, symptoms emerged concurrently with the arrival of a cat in the residence. Given that humans frequently exhibit hypersensitivity to animal saliva, this scenario is highly probable as a hypothesis.
Consequently, the following strategy is needed. Primarily, pharmacological therapy with intranasal antihistamines and reduced interaction with the cat is necessary if the hypersensitivity source is verified (Seidman et al., 2015). If the proposed therapy proves ineffective, more intricate pharmacological treatment or nasal area surgical procedures must be considered (Seidman et al., 2015). Antihistamine medications and decongestants are proposed for pharmacological treatment.
Fexofenadine is the pharmacologically active derivative of terfenadine; it lacks a sedative impact. The antihistamine effect manifests after 1 hour, peaks after 6 hours, and lasts for 24 hours. No dependency is observed after 28 days of administration, a notable accomplishment compared to similar drugs from previous generations (Klimek et al., 2019). Phenylephrine is included in combined formulations for treating acute respiratory viral infections and influenza to achieve a moderate vasoconstrictive effect. It diminishes swelling and hyperemia of the nasal mucosa by stimulating Î±1-adrenergic receptors (Klimek et al., 2019). In this situation, the misuse of intranasal vasoconstrictor medications, which can lead to dependence and solely address symptoms, is discouraged. Wearing masks and other respiratory system-restricting personal protective gear is also inadvisable.
