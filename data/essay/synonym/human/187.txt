A Western academia has misrepresented the extensive history of African civilization for centuries, and many of its fundamental principles have been seen through the perspective of colonization. Consequently, the concepts and doctrines of African philosophy have been taken over and altered in worth from the innate components of people’s character into goods. In their writings, p’Bitek and Marimba talk about such notions as tradition, faith, and ideology of African nations and how Western beliefs have transformed their representation without entirely grasping their significance. The commercialization of African civilization and the enforcement of European perspectives on the differentiation between tradition and philosophy, faith and faithfulness have disturbed African individuals’ capacity to recognize themselves.
The concepts by academics indicate that African civilization does not separate itself from ideology or draw a boundary between reality and the sacred essence of one’s existence. European civilization is depicted as practical and commercializing – it transforms aspects of life that are supposed to be utilized into items for examination. p’Bitek states that culture changes from “the lifestyle of a people” into “something that is purchased and sold” (“What is Culture?” 14). Consequently, younger generations of Africans, particularly those residing in Western nations, perceive their culture as a compilation of mementos, not elements of everyday life. Simultaneously, they are exposed to the Western faiths extolling destitution and individualism (p’Bitek, “Man Born Unfree” 21). Ani observes that African-Americans endure as they do not feel adequately linked to traditional African society but sense a schism between themselves and European identity (49). Such disconnection results in individuals losing their communal and generational identity.
The readings deliberated above reveal that African and European doctrines collide in numerous ways, and the latter takes authority over the portrayal of the former. Consequently, generations of individuals are distanced from their culture, relinquishing it or perceiving it through the distorted viewpoint of commercialization. African civilization is inherently associated with philosophy, faith, living in the present, and recognizing the fullness of life. Nonetheless, it is transformed into a sightseeing attraction, and its people are compelled to observe it through the perspective of outsiders, losing their innate connection to history and nature.
