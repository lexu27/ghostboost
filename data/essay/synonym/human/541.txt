One decision that showcases the author’s theoretical consciousness effectively is the concluding moment in the initial chapter of Maus, when the narrator’s father cautions him not to reveal what he shared about his adolescence. It illustrates that Spiegelman is eloquently mindful of the reality that the majority of his audience might not possess firsthand information about the Holocaust and, for them, it would simply be a segment from history books. By reiterating the romantic escapades of the protagonist’s adolescence, he succeeds in making him more comprehensible, relatable, and, despite being portrayed as a mouse, more humane. This rhetorical selection enables the audience, who likely would be uninformed about the Holocaust other than through the high school history class, to emotionally connect with the subject.
Furthermore, the mere inclusion of this moment in the chapter imparts it with a confessional attribute. In the scene, the father implores the narrator to disregard what he just disclosed because it is irrelevant to the Holocaust, marking it as personal data. Nevertheless, from perusing the chapter, the readers are already aware that the narrator does not uphold his vow as the narrative is right there, narrated through both illustrations and text. Once more, incorporating this moment demonstrates Spiegelman’s understanding that much of his audience may not have a direct and personal link to the Holocaust. Nonetheless, by introducing this scene, the writer engenders a sensation in the audience as if they have been granted insight into something private and intimate, fostering a stronger connection to the subject matter. Therefore, the decision to incorporate the incident with the narrator’s father requesting to exclude the accounts of his adolescence is astute in a multifaceted manner.
