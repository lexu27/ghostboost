The Connection that Exists Between Kate Chopin’s At The Cadian Ball and The Storm
The Storm seems to be a continuation of Kate Chopin’s At The Cadian Ball. Both narratives feature the same primary figures: Bobinot, Calixta, Alcee, and Clarisse. Alcee and Calixta socialize at Assumption, where the dance occurs. They engage in playful behavior until Clarisse arrives and whisks Alcee away, leaving Calixta alone on the balcony. Subsequently, Bobinot locates her and subsequently proposes to her on their journey home, to which she agrees. Conversely, Clarisse accepts Alcee’s proposal, which she had formerly declined.
The Storm elucidates the aftermath of these two pairs marrying and the consequences of their hasty decisions to wed each other. The two women accept their partners’ proposals out of fear of losing them and envy of the other rival. The primary themes in The Storm encompass sex and fractured marriages. The title The Storm symbolizes the tumult in some characters’ lives, leading Calixta and Alcee to wed others. Hence, the two narratives are interconnected in that one serves as a continuation of the other.
The Concept of Social Status in At The Cadian Ball
The issue of social hierarchy determines the activities in which the characters can engage. Clarisse opts out of attending the Cadian Ball and becomes upset when Alcee attends. Both Alcee and Clarisse are Creoles, belonging to the Spanish and French settlers in Louisiana. In many of Kate Chopin’s tales, Creoles are affluent, many possessing extensive land and engaging in commerce. Bobino and Calixta are Acadian descendants of the American exiled French from Acadia, driven from their homes by British colonizers during their rule in 1775. In most of her narratives, the Acadians are relatively impoverished compared to the Creoles, primarily working as fishermen and farmers, sustaining themselves off the land and serving the Creoles. Clarisse’s Creole heritage denotes her elevated social standing, which explains her absence from the ball and her bewilderment at Alcee’s attendance.
How At The Cadian Ball Centers Around Love and Attraction
The writer endeavors to distinguish and separate the notions of love, attraction, and desire. This short narrative illustrates attraction through flirtation. At Assumption, where the Cadian ball occurs, upon encountering Calixta, Alcee escorts her to a secluded area where they engage in flirtatious behavior until Clarisse intervenes and departs with Alcee. Furthermore, Kate Chopin portrays love through dedication and faithfulness. At the ball, Bobinot searches for Calixta, and upon discovering her alone on the balcony, he offers to escort her home. Bobinot’s sentiments and conduct towards Calixta exemplify love. Despite her lack of attention towards him, Bobinot remains unreasonably enthusiastic, relishing any acknowledgment Calixta bestows upon him. Ultimately, the writer captures the themes of love and attraction through the enthusiasm and flirtation exhibited by various characters.
How the Author Utilizes This Short Story to Highlight Issues Associated with Feminism and Impropriety
This narrative transpires in 1892, marking the conclusion of the Victorian era, characterized by stringent societal norms. Individuals of elevated social standing, particularly women, were permitted a degree of impropriety in behavior, provided they remained polite. Nonetheless, Calixta deviates from this norm; carefree and occasionally brusque, she stands in contrast to the expected decorum. Similar to many of Kate Chopin’s works from the early 20th century, At The Cadian Ball epitomizes feminist ideals, with Calixta embodying the defiance of women in that era against established societal norms and expectations imposed by men, yet managing to integrate and be embraced by society. Consequently, a thorough examination of this tale unveils the underpinnings of feminism and impropriety.
At The Cadian Ball Exhibits Instances of Racial Bias
The narrative unfolds during a period of distinct social strata, where one’s lineage and ancestry determined their social ranking. Bruce, an African American Creole servant, endures discrimination throughout the narrative due to his racial background. Consequently, he occupies the lowest rung on Louisiana’s economic and social ladder. Similar to Bruce, African Americans served as servants to the affluent following the war. Hence, there is ample evidence to suggest that this narrative endeavors to spotlight the issue of racial discrimination in society.
Can At The Cadian Ball Be Regarded as a New Woman’s Tale?
The Cadian Ball mirrors the cultural values of Acadian and Creole societies in the 19th century. However, it unfolds within a patriarchal society where women lack a significant voice. Women in this milieu were restricted and to some extent prohibited from expressing their sexual desires, instead expected to adhere to the conventions of the time, which prescribed adherence to traditional gender roles. Kate Chopin’s narrative serves as a plea for female emancipation from subjugation, servitude, and imposed reliance within a male-dominated society. Unfortunately, none of the female characters achieve this liberation despite their endeavors to attain it.
