"Margins of the Rainbow" was crafted by Michael Delsol and Haruku Shinozaki in 2017. It is a compilation of images and personal anecdotes of LGBT+Q community representatives from various regions of Japan. Michael Delsos is a French cameraperson who portrays individuals involved in artistry, and his images are featured in periodicals and newspapers. He also engages in showcases where Delsol displays his work independently or alongside other photographers. Haruku Shinozaki is a reporter, and he delves into the fringe communities and minority groups in Japan, especially LGBTQ+ community members. This publication caters to a specific audience, such as social advocates, delegates of minority factions, demographic analysts, and those intrigued to discover more about the encounters of marginalized communities in Japan. The intention of the project is to acquaint the audience with the ordeals of minorities in one of the most orthodox and conventional nations globally. The heading of the book signifies the two contrasting aspects of the LGBTQ+ culture in Japan, suggesting that, on one side, it is a universal subject that arises in writings, performances, anime, the Japanese animations (Delsol & Shinozaki, 2017). Conversely, beneath it, there exists a certain degree of bias and traditionalism, as vividly depicted by the moniker "Margins of the Rainbow." The revelations of the individuals whose stories are recounted within the book are captivating and enthralling since, ultimately, individuals of diverse professions and societal standings can epitomize the LGBTQ+ community. Delsol and Shinozaki (2017) mention an Episcopal clergyman who from a very young age was deeply devout and resolved to conduct services for the LGBTQ+ congregants so they could have a secure space to embrace their spirituality. Another instance is an initiative named akta that endeavors to provide sexual enlightenment for individuals and raise awareness regarding HIV/AIDS prevention (Delsol, Shinozaki 2017). They also offer literary works and other educational materials on the LGBTQ+ subject and welcome queer individuals seeking aid or support in any personal circumstance. Individuals of varying sexual orientations and genders are significantly more varied than the conventional stereotypes portray. One of the primary notions of Delsol and Shinozaki (2017) is that society envisions an LGBTQ+ individual as someone flamboyant in vivid attire and atypical appearance, yet predominantly they are ordinary individuals. This could be a clergyman from the community church, an educator, or a bus operator â€“ they are all distinct, and each possesses a unique past and disposition. The objective of the book is to present to the world the existence of LGBTQ+ individuals and their method of self-expression in locations where society is viewed as conservative or traditional concerning the matter. The labor dedicated to the challenges of the existence of minorities in a nation with a robust traditional heritage is genuinely a protest. The existences of everyday individuals captured within it with their tribulations instruct us to be more accepting of others since profound agony can be concealed behind a cheerful facade. Despite the inner fortitude of the tales recounted, "Margins of the Rainbow" cannot instruct us on how to enhance the circumstances of these individuals on a global scale. "Margins of the Rainbow" aligns with the ASAN 201 concept as it also aids in comprehending Asian culture through a multifaceted approach, illustrating the communal aspect of the matter. Despite the contentious subject, the authors narrate existence with integrity and dignity, as it ought to be in Japanese society. According to Delsol and Shinozaki (2017), the publication unveils the realm that was formerly overlooked. One thing is evident: this labor has significantly contributed to endeavors to enhance the lives of minorities and converse about a subject that has long been forbidden in Japanese society.
