Legal decisions are the results of occurrences in which the arbitrators are restricted by specified regulations, autonomous from external influences, and obligated by their societal encounters or sensitivities. In Duncan Kennedy’s Liberty and Restraint in Adjudication: A Crucial Phenomenology, the elucidation of the law is depicted as a continuous interchange between law and existence. Consequently, most legal judgments are evident outcomes mirroring the legal contentions, presented evidence, and the judge’s ideological pledges. Nonetheless, Kennedy asserts that arbitrators formulate the desired consequence at the initial introduction of a disagreement. Consequently, the subsequent interpretation and scrutiny of the law strive to uphold their perception of fairness and validate their decisions to render the judgment agreeable. While this contention mirrors the intrinsic conflict and interaction between existence and the law, it underscores the inescapability of the principle of political neutrality in adjudication procedures. Although judges typically arrive at their conclusions by adhering to the legal regulations of judging and exercising their liberties in making judicial selections, their encounters and societal context frequently sway the outcome of cases.
Duncan Kennedy’s Denial of Political Neutrality in Adjudication
Adjudication is the procedure through which judicial officials exercise their power to resolve disputes. It includes judges’ elucidation of the law through the observance of the established legal restraints and the exercise of judicial selections in making determinations. Kennedy (526) argues that legal procedures reflect a continuous interplay between liberty and restraint. Manko (2) supports this stance and asserts that traditionally, arbitrators decide on matters brought before them by interpreting and situating the laws against the provided evidence and facts. However, such an elucidation entails grappling with the matters of value, which indicates that arbitrators cannot evade integrating political considerations in their decision-making. This suggests that the interpretation of the law is not entirely a restricted or completely open endeavor. As a result, judges feel compelled to interpret the law in a well-defined manner and in alignment with their perception of fairness. This subjectivity reflects the phenomenological facets of the interpreter of the law and encompasses the context and ideological vow of the judges.
Furthermore, the literal elucidation of the law confines the capacity of the judicial officials to adequately examine and contemplate the materials presented. In most instances, the legal resources indicate obvious outcomes after assessing the evidence and contentions. This proposal implies that judges are, by law preprogrammed to deliver clear conclusions through the impartial interpretation of the relevant legal provisions (Klaasen 1). Nonetheless, Kennedy (527) contends that the prevailing laws frequently do not furnish definitive responses to a disagreement, yet judges are mandated to make determinations. This would signify that arbitrators are technically prohibited from making certain judicial determinations through the precise legal reasoning. According to van Domselaar (72), such fixation on the regulations and principles diminishes judicial proceedings to hollow rituals conducted towards specific outcomes. Harris and Sen (242) argue that such a standpoint conflicts with the long-standing empirical observation that law and its application are never certain, explicit, and precise but rather variable and ambiguous. With such vagueness, uncertainty, and absence of clear correct responses, it would be imprudent and illogical to anticipate judges to be politically neutral.
