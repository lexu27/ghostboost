The conflict for the autonomy of Latin America was of significant historical importance. Due to this conflict, the individuals residing in the former Spanish and Portuguese settlements attained national freedom that promoted their crucial concerns. Among the pioneers of the battle for autonomy originated from various classes. Nevertheless, due to the limited and feeble colonial middle class, the leadership of the liberation movement was predominantly in the possession of the Creole landowners. The rise of opposition among the Creoles and the appearance of covert Creole groups focused on scheming were also the factors why this faction directed the rebellion.
By the conclusion of the 18th century, in the Spanish and Portuguese colonies in America, the middle class development accelerated, the stratum of Creoles concentrated on overseas markets fortified, and the intellectuals emerged. These social factions were acutely dissatisfied with the colonial authoritiesâ€™ strategy of strict limitations on commerce and enterprise. They also resented the bias against the Creoles in the lawful realm and the absence of favorable circumstances for innovative activity. Simultaneously, the vast majority of peasants, comprising Indians and mestizos, were harshly exploited. They strived for the chance to labor freely on their ancestral lands. The people's battle of Spanish America for autonomy objectively fulfilled the necessities of capitalist growth, which was obstructed by the colonial system.
The global situation was conducive to the battle for autonomy. At the finish of the 18th and commencement of the 19th centuries, Spain was embroiled in devastating conflicts with France and England. In these conditions, the Creole resistance intensified its operations. During this duration, covert patriotic groups were founded across Spanish America. Their objective was to prepare an armed operation and topple Spanish colonial domination. The Creole resistance prompted uprisings because they required the eradication of colonial levies and limitations on commerce and industry.
It was for Creole industrialists that the markets of the colonies and even those of the metropolises became restricted. For their continuous expansion, unrestricted entry to the global market was crucial. Furthermore, it was on their behalf in the rivalry with Europeans that they had the upper hand of the abundance, inexpensiveness, and untapped fertility of the lands of the New World. In them, the concepts of liberalism discovered the most fervent admirers, resolute combatants for absolute freedom of commerce and enterprise. Additionally, this ideology was discordant not solely with the Iberian but also with any other colonial limitations. Besides their position in the colonial economy, the Creole elite varied from the other echelons of colonial society in their distinct understanding of their concerns and objectives. This is since many Creoles were immensely educated and belonged to the intellectual class.
The people's battle of Spanish America for autonomy objectively fulfilled the necessities of capitalist growth, which was obstructed by the colonial system. Nevertheless, the eradication of the colonial system and the attainment of political autonomy were accompanied by significant transformations. Virtually all Latin American nations instituted a republican system. In several nations, slavery was entirely or partially annulled, and the ecclesiastical rights were curtailed. The native population was relieved of paying per capita levies and coerced labor provision. Latin American nations were permitted to actively partake in international commerce, which established advantageous circumstances for cultivating capitalist relations.
