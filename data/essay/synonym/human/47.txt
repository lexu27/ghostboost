Guaman Poma observed the injustices of the colonial administration and personally endured by its hands. He was the offspring of Incan aristocrats who grew up after the conquest of Peru by the Spanish. His family was deprived of their lands and titles, and his efforts to reclaim them were consistently rejected by the colonial government (Kilroy-Ewbank, n.d.). Despite initially collaborating with the colonialists, Poma was banished for allegedly false assertions of nobility and then chose to publicly condemn the Spanish treatment of natives. He released a 1200-page illustrated manuscript directed to the Spanish monarch, detailing the Andean way of life before invasion and the mistreatments they had endured since under the Conquistadors.

Poma’s document exemplifies the complete atrocities of colonialism and argues that the Spanish were alien settlers who had no entitlement to take charge of the land God had bestowed upon Peruvians. He suggests a system of political arrangement wherein the administration is representative of its populace and tailored to their practical requirements (Kilroy-Ewbank, n.d.). Poma has thus made a notable contribution to the dialogues of freedom, political representation, social obligation, and self-governance of individual states. His concept that the administration should be established for and by the individuals that have historically inhabited the land it governs is remarkably modern.

Moreover, Poma’s work entirely rebuts the notion that Europeans brought civilization and political arrangement to the Incas. This interpretation is exposed as merely a hypocritical facade to legitimize violence, economic exploitation, and cultural obliteration as a method of political dominance. It illustrates how an entire way of life was utterly demolished and lost as its people were deprived of their liberty and compelled to assimilate. Although Poma respects the ethical principles the Spanish claim to adhere to, he demonstrates that they have not genuinely lived up to them.
