Contemporary society is diverse and mono-cultural, which is a distinct and highly recent occurrence for individuals. In the past, humanity resided in distinct, frequently secluded, monocultural, and mono-ethnic communities, viewing individuals who were strangers exceptionally negatively. Nevertheless, as time has passed, the globe has become globalized, and due to social, historical, and economic factors, contemporary individuals live in diverse and heterogeneous communities. It is specifically because of this theme of interaction among individuals of varied ethnicities and cultures that their impact on each other is still the subject of active investigation (Nelson et al., 2018). This article investigates the interaction and characteristics of the growth of ethnic identity for white and black young adolescents.
A research by del Toro and Wang (2020) examined whether school cultural upbringing of 961 African American teenagers anticipated GPA through their ethnic and racial identity. The outcomes revealed that teenagers who perceived more school upbringing achieved higher grades at 1 and 2 years. Additionally, the research talks about the consequences of how educators can assist teenagers of color excel in school by decreasing tension and miscommunication between white and black teenagers.
Several research studies back the idea that, notwithstanding the relatively generally accepted notion that parenting and identities are mainly influenced by parents, this is not completely accurate. The ultimate meta-analytical model adjusted for sample size indicated that parental ethnic upbringing predicted ERI research and adherence, while only peer training for bias predicted ERI adherence. The outcomes of this research accentuate the significance of both parents and peers for cultural upbringing processes during adulthood (Hughes et al., 2017). Consequently, the research verifies the notion of the establishment of ethnic identity through communication. Lastly, it suggests that cultural upbringing among white and black teenagers, with an adaptive approach, is advantageous for their character.
