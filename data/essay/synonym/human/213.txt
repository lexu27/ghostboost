The culpable but mentally ill (GBMI) decision might be seen as a highly debatable occurrence that has nevertheless been embraced by a significant number of states despite little empirical backing and strong critique. Generally, it is a specific decision choice that allows both psychiatric care and traditional criminal penalties for defendants whose criminal act was influenced by their mental disorder (Bartol & Bartol, 2020). Essentially, in the event of the GBMI decision, juries and judges formally recognize a perpetrator's mental ailment and find him guilty of criminal transgression concurrently.
The GBMI decision was implemented due to the escalating number of offenses committed by defendants who had been formerly acquitted as not guilty by reason of insanity (NGRI). Simultaneously, the GBMI decision was established as an alternative for a judge to determine a sentence based on an individual's culpability and insanity. Its aim is to reduce the instances of NGRI acquittees' premature release based on the peculiarities of the GBMI decision. Consequently, an offender who receives it is penalized like any other defendant found guilty (Bartol & Bartol, 2020). Simultaneously, he undergoes mental care to the extent specified by the court. The primary distinctiveness of the GBMI decision is the perpetrator serving the remainder of his sentence if and when his mental wellness is deemed stabilized (Bartol & Bartol, 2020). This aspect is a significant contrast from the terms of the NGRI decision that assumes discharging the insanity-defense acquittee from psychiatric commitment when he is no longer a threat to society.
The GBMI decision remains highly contentious as it assumes rehabilitation and societal empathy for an offender alongside the penal sentence and the system's oversight. On one hand, mentally ill defendants receive essential treatment while being penalized for their criminal deeds. Furthermore, the decision shields community members by detaining those defendants for the duration of their sentences even if their mental health improves. Conversely, in the instance of the NGRI decision, the lack of defendants' culpability is rationalized by their insanity. Moreover, remaining incarcerated with stabilized mental health enables GBMI defendants to comprehend their errors and deter recidivism.
Conversely, the GBMI decision is frequently censured for being a deceptive choice introduced for political motives that lacks a specific objective and bewilders jurors. Prejudices may arise based on their personal presumptions and result in incorrect judgments. For example, jurors may deem a specific defendant as more hazardous guided by bias, stereotypical reasoning, and personal convictions and opt for the GBMI decision to prioritize community safety. Nevertheless, in this scenario, jurors acknowledge a defendant's mental ailment and accountability for the criminal act simultaneously, even if a defendant may be unaware due to insanity.
Moreover, the GBMI decision generates disparities for incarcerated perpetrators. Per the terms, GBMI defendants receive mental health assistance, and numerous treatment services are accessible to them. Conversely, a significant number of offenders who were convicted face the deterioration of their mental health and the onset of various mental illnesses while in prison. Nonetheless, their sentences do not entail the provision of treatment services. Consequently, the GBMI decision fosters the establishment of a specific system in which a type of sentence engenders bias and disparities.
