Introduction
This article intends to examine the Japanese commercial discovered on the website Ads of the World. This advertisement endorses a merchandise labeled "Toilet Quickle Deodorant Coat Sheet," designed to assist homemakers in eliminating unpleasant smells in the lavatory. An evaluation of this commercial indicates that it cannot be standardized for the US viewers; instead, it must be adjusted due to the language and cultural distinctions, such as variations in the use of attraction and analogies and the significance of diversity.
Main body
Arguably, the most conspicuous justification for the necessity to adjust this commercial for the US audience as opposed to standardizing it is the utilization of the Japanese language. In this commercial, the Japanese language is employed in the dialogue of the performers communicating the information to the clientele and the indications on the monitor. Although the dialogue of the performers can easily be translated into English, the indications on the monitor need to be modified. This is because the Japanese language employs characters that seem much more compressed than English words. Consequently, merely transcribing the Japanese words into English would alter the arrangement of the pictures that back up the information conveyed by the speakers.
The subsequent rationale for modification is that this commercial is shot in the style of a climate report recognized by Japanese homemakers. In the US, the style for such programs varies to some degree, indicating that this commercial might seem less recognizable to American homemakers. The commercial also illustrates such a prevalent aspect of Japanese etiquette as bowing, which is not utilized in the US and, as a result, should be omitted when adjusting the commercial for the American audience.
The method in which the communication is conveyed in the Japanese and American societies is also dissimilar, which further advocates the necessity for adjustment rather than standardization. In particular, in Japan, commercials utilize indirect communication to impart their messages and enable the audience to determine for themselves what they should think about the brand. This is because Japanese individuals, in contrast to Americans, possess unfavorable attitudes toward hard-sell practices, so commercials employing direct communication would be ineffective in this nation. Additionally, Japanese commercials do not typically employ analogies. Conversely, US commercials utilize direct communication to communicate the brand value to the audience and frequently contrast different brands in their campaigns, for instance, in the promotional campaigns of McDonald's and Burger King. The commercial under scrutiny does not explicitly state that the endorsed brand is the finest in the market and refrains from making any contrasts; it merely provides a concise explanation of the product's purpose. To modify the commercial for the US audience, marketers should clearly articulate their message concerning the brand's value.
Furthermore, the advertisement requires adjustment rather than standardization due to the discrepancies in the utilization of appeals in the US and Japan. Japanese commercials appeal to the audience's emotions, while American commercials appeal to rational logic. Consequently, Japanese commercials predominantly encompass images that stimulate viewers' sentiments, whereas American commercials use testimonials, logical arguments, and spokespersons to persuade individuals through logical explanations. The commercial under review distinctly illustrates the distinctiveness of Japanese culture in advertising. It does not mention any specific data, such as what constituents contribute to the eradication of smells or what experts in the hygiene sector say about this product. Instead, it appeals to the audience's emotions by focusing on the issue addressed by the promoted product - the unpleasant smell. Specifically, the female on the left represents a Japanese homemaker who expresses concerns similar to those that homemakers throughout Japan are anticipated to have. While this method may be effective in Japan, it could prove ineffective in the US owing to the audience's anticipation of a rational rationale for why they necessitate this product. To modify this commercial for American viewers, it could encompass factual evidence supporting the effectiveness of the product.
One ultimate justification for adaptation is the contrast in the ethnic composition of the populace in the US and Japan. Japan is predominantly a monoethnic nation, indicating that the bulk of its populace is Japanese. Consequently, it is completely suitable for Japanese commercials, including the commercial under review, to showcase solely Japanese individuals. In the US, the racial and ethnic composition is significantly more varied, and there is a recent inclination to mirror this diversity in various media, including commercials. Hence, the adjustment of this advertisement for the US audience is crucial to mirror the diverse racial compositions of the US society and conform to the burgeoning trend for diversity in advertising.
Conclusion
To wrap up, the given advertisement cannot be standardized for the US due to substantial distinctions between American and Japanese cultures and languages. Consequently, the advertisement should be adapted in terms of language, communication tactic, type of appeal, and racial portrayal. Particularly, owing to the distinct writing systems of the English and Japanese languages, the advertisement's layout should be altered for a more appealing appearance for the English-speaking audience. It should also encompass more factual particulars about the product and can incorporate testimonials and direct product comparisons.
