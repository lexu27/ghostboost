Application
Cultural Standards
The aforementioned field log delineates the typical day of the woman who possesses a family, a profession, hobbies, and educational aspirations, from which career ambitions emerge. Hence, I endeavor to distribute my resources in a manner that enables the most appropriate integration of all those aspects, which presupposes engagement in multiple spheres concurrently. This aspect, in turn, amplifies the importance of the function cultural norms play in my life since the volume as well as the variety of my social contacts inevitably expands.
Hence, while on a walk, cultural norms encompass tidiness and proper conduct that does not cause any inconvenience for the neighboring individuals and others. Additionally, aiding friends can indeed be perceived as a norm; those who decline to do so are automatically deemed deviant, irrespective of the rationale. When shopping, the fundamental requirement based on norms is to queue without attempting to bypass it, for instance, by force; in terms of online communication, hate speech and falsehoods are socially unacceptable. Even household life partly hinges on cultural norms, such as cleanliness and fresh breath, which hygiene practices like teeth brushing target.
Macro-Level and Micro-Level Analysis
It is quite evident that norms influence both the lives of specific individuals and the functioning of the entire society, as the latter essentially comprises the former. A norm exists if the community members engage in specific behavior, assuming that others do the same or anticipating approval from those whose opinions matter to them (UNICEF, 2021). Consequently, at the macro level, cultural standards prompt the vast majority of the populace to act similarly in particular situations and contexts. Consequently, unwritten but widely recognized and strongly enforced patterns emerge that eventually become inherent to the culture. Meanwhile, the micro level pertains to the necessity for an individual to align his or her daily behavior with those guidelines for society to perceive him or her as normal.
Concept Analysis
Given the hectic nature of the day the field log portrays, various concepts are relevant to it. One of the primary among them is socialization, which is crucial for both individuals and society, particularly within the context of norms. Thus, Ward et al. (2019) emphasize that communication not only facilitates the transmission of the rules and principles of a specific community to the subsequent generations but also enables individuals to view themselves from an external perspective. In essence, an individual gains an opportunity to perceive how others regard him or her; this, in turn, identifies the areas where adjustments are required if necessary.
The concept of family, whose indispensable role is evident from the log, encompasses two subconcepts in this instance, notably, nuclear and extended. The former is noteworthy among the principal determinants of the routine due to the necessity to synchronize all of the daily actions with the partner's lifestyle, daily regimen, and expectations. The extended family, on the other hand, links the micro group, whose nuclear equivalent is, to the society, a vital agent of socialization. It is noteworthy that families might possess internal traditions, such as customary communication styles; however, these should not supersede cultural norms in extraneous contexts. Should they do so, the likelihood of society accepting the individual is inversely proportional to the extent of the discrepancy.
Engagements and image control are also pivotal aspects, which, in reality, are closely intertwined since public perception of an individual determines his or her social success. In sociological terms, this fact prompts individuals to develop so-called images that reflect how they wish to be perceived by others (Grebelsky‐Lichtman et al., 2020). Simply put, the necessity to engage with society compels its members to accentuate their strengths and mask their weaknesses to attain a higher level of acceptance. In my case, I monitor the stylishness of my attire and refrain from divulging certain challenges I am confronting to my extended family to enhance my image favorably.
Reflection
As evident from the scrutiny of my daily life, I engage with society through various channels concurrently, assuming multiple roles. Consequently, within my nuclear family, I serve as a partner, while within the extended family, I am positioned as their offspring, grandchild, cousin, and others. Consequently, the manner in which I interact with each circle varies as well, primarily due to the discrepancy in my sentiments in these scenarios. Notably, my husband regards me as an adult, aiding me in recognizing my responsibilities and making significant decisions. Conversely, my parents and more distant relatives view me as still too young to be self-reliant, which can be quite disheartening and, furthermore, affects my self-worth.
Outside the family, my roles
