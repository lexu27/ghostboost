The current wealth distribution arrangements in the U.S. are distant from the embodiment of justice. One profession that I sense is underpaid at the moment is the certified nurse in various healthcare settings. Based on insights gained from my associates functioning as hospital RNs, the level of accountability for patients’ well-being does not correspond with the average financial remuneration that these experts receive. One occupation that I think is excessively compensated is the National Football League athlete. Eminent clubs’ expanding earnings and football games’ growing accessibility because of technological advancements likely elucidate why footballers’ salaries are exceedingly high.
The rationales for opting for these instances relate to remuneration sizes’ preferred reliance on the work’s level of societal significance. Specifically, utilitarian ethics could be utilized to validate the selection of instances. The core tenet of utilitarianism is an emphasis on actions and decisions that maximize well-being and foster the contentment of a substantial number of individuals (Woodard, 2019). In line with utilitarianism, an action is commendable and crucial if it brings advantages to the masses. Contributions that RNs and NFL athletes provide to society cannot be equivalent in importance. If there were no RNs, hospital inpatients would obtain treatment from physicians but would be devoid of attention and continuous supervision, leading to more frequent hospital infections, post-surgery complications overlooked until it is too late, and avoidable fatalities. Conversely, if there were no NFL athletes, sports enthusiasts would have fewer alternatives when watching sports, which contradicts the gains from RNs’ labor. Remunerating footballers less and compensating RNs more would optimize society’s well-being by prioritizing survival over amusement.
Rectifying the injustice discussed above would be demanding but still plausible. One hypothetical approach is the utilization of petitions for restricting NFL athletes’ salaries or implementing new levies for the representatives of overcompensated professions. Enforcing profit utilization regulations on sizable sports entities to compel them to contribute a substantial portion of earnings to charity is another contentious but viable prospect. Under these circumstances, major leagues and teams would have to limit salaries. Another method of rectifying the injustice would involve petitioning for legislative measures to boost minimum wages for RNs. For this measure, society’s backing would be amassed with the aid of contentions that higher salaries heighten competition, and competition would result in enhancements in care quality, thereby enhancing better public health results.
