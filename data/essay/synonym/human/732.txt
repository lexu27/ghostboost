Welcome to the Geological Time Machine, the unique invention that enables individuals an opportunity to explore past geologic periods through guided tours. Our exclusive offering provides three categories of excursions tailored for three geological epochs. In general, these geological epochs signify the distinct transformations that the planet Earth and its surroundings encountered over time. The subsequent travel handbook will furnish more detailed insights into the features of each epoch and its primary attractions that you can explore via our tours.

Paleozoic Era Expedition
Time span: Paleozoic Era commenced 541 million years ago and concluded 252 million years ago

This expedition unfolds during two of the most captivating and exceptional periods of the Paleozoic era: the Devonian and the Permian periods. The Devonian segment of the expedition spotlights the existence of diverse marine creatures that inhabited the ocean. Conversely, the Permian period segment of the expedition illustrates the potential fauna on Earth if the Permian extinction event had not transpired.

The Paleozoic Era marked the dawn of contemporary life and is distinguished by the emergence of various life forms and organisms. The Paleozoic era commenced with substantial proliferation and evolution of new life and culminated with a colossal extinction of numerous beings referred to as the Permian extinction. The phenomena of global warming triggered the Permian extinction.

Mesozoic Era Excursion
Periods within the era: Cambrian, Ordovician, Silurian, Devonian, Carboniferous, Permian

Time span: Paleozoic Era began 252 million years ago and ceased 66 million years ago.

The Mesozoic Era is the second significant geologic era renowned for the existence of dinosaurs. Furthermore, this era is also recognized for the emergence of the early ancestors of contemporary animals. This expedition is recommended for the younger audience and individuals intrigued by fauna. Mammalian creatures, birds, and various plants evolved during the Mesozoic era. The era was also characterized by a different climate that was notably warmer with subtle variations between seasons. Analogous to the Paleozoic Era, the Mesozoic era culminated with a massive extinction caused by a meteor impact on Earth. The site where the meteor struck, the Chicxulub crater, is located in Mexico.

Periods within the era: Triassic, Jurasic, Cretaceous.

Cenozoic Era Journey
Time frame: from 66 million years ago to the present day.

The Cenozoic Era is the final geologic era in which people presently reside. The Cenozoic era symbolizes the epoch of mammals' dominance over other life forms. The era is marked by a significant surge in the diversity of various species and subspecies of mammals and animals. Another pivotal aspect that differentiates the era is the cessation of the continents' movement in their current positions. The climate has also transitioned from warm and temperate in the Mesozoic era. The temperatures considerably decreased, leading to the formation of polar ice caps and glaciations. The Cenozoic era excursion encompasses a sequence of temporal leaps enabling visitors to observe the formation of mountains and the evolution of human settlements.
