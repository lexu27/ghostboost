In order to thrive as an organization, its supervisors and staff need to dedicate themselves to specific principles and strive to achieve them in reality. In this context, Fisher (2008) proposes ten principles that, in the writer’s view, should be fundamental for any establishment. Nina, the Manager of an outpatient dialysis center, highlighted three fundamental business principles, specifically determine who you cater to, oversee employees, and determine what sets you apart, which aided her in effectively managing the center.

Concerning the first point, determining who to cater to is a pivotal stage as it defines the focus of a company’s operations. Secondly, supervising employees ensures that healthcare professionals are consistently committed to enhancing the quality of their work and offering patient-focused care. Lastly, determining what sets you apart ensures that the company continuously enhances its performance and also establishes fundamental values that can position them as the most dependable and credible facility.

As per Nina, their mission statement is “To be the Provider, Partner, and Employer of Choice.” This aligns perfectly with the principles as each aspect is given consideration. The center aims to provide opportunities and educational services to their employees encompassing appropriate psychological, physical, and comprehensive patient care, which enables them not only to concentrate on the primary focus, patients, but also to motivate the staff and stay distinctive. In essence, it can be viewed as a dedication to continuous learning and enhancement, which is undeniably essential for enhancing the quality of nursing practice (Caldwel et al., 2017).

Hence, it can be contended that the three selected principles are highly significant in the healthcare domain as they are linked with enhanced performance. Specifically, they ensure that the staff is always conscious of their scope of duty and adhere closely to the organization’s mission. Furthermore, their integration of other Fisher principles, determining who they cater to and what sets them apart, guarantees that they sustain their competitive edge.
