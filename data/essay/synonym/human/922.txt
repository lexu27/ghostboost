It is essential that all mistakes and omissions are dealt with in accounting records; thus, a specific procedure exists to amend potential problematic entries. First and foremost, it is required to review the financial statement from the prior period to ascertain that there was indeed an inaccuracy. Subsequently, it is vital to analyze the influence of the mistake on the carrying assets amounts and liabilities of the company. Then, there can be two ways to rectify the existing error. The accountant can reverse the incorrect entry, and they introduce a second entry containing the accurate transaction (Weygandt et al., 2020). Concurrently, the accountant also can make a journal entry that will correct the existing error if combined with the inaccurate entry. For example, a purchase of $20-worth supplies can be credited as accounts receivable instead of accounts payable. In this scenario, the mistake can be rectified by crediting accounts payable for $20 and debiting accounts receivable for $20 in a single entry.
