Individuals from varied cultures possess diverse perspectives toward different aspects of the external world. They are grounded on a culture’s principles, which determine how its constituents respond to the surroundings: for instance, whether to conform to it or attempt to govern it. A notable instance is the connections with nature: Western society and minor Indigenous American civilizations hold distinct outlooks on nature, customs, and their communities in general. Grasping those inconsistencies among cultures and establishing positive communication may significantly aid in enhancing the welfare of small civilizations’ members and conserving nature.
Case Study Summary: Lummi People
Lummi individuals are the Indigenous American tribe dwelling in Washington state. They endure substantial lumber production, which has persisted since the 19th century (Russo, 2011). Those territories were brimming with ancient forests, esteemed for the Lummi people; hence, their felling was ruinous for the tribe. In the 20th century, a majority of those forests were completely eradicated, leading to the near-complete annihilation of the tribe. Nowadays, tribe representatives and American government institutions, such as the Washington State Department of Natural Resources, strive for interaction to safeguard both the remaining woodlands and the tribe.
