Gentlewoman Mary
Gentlewoman Mary Wroth was a part of a distinguished scholarly family during the Renaissance. She was the niece of Mary Herbert, a notable writer and supporter during the 16th century. Mary wedded Robert Roth, but their marriage was unhappy. Meanwhile, Gentlewoman Mary started to express her sorrow with the assistance of poetry. Consequently, her sonnet In this peculiar maze embodies the writer’s contemplation on the enigmas that love conceals. The importance of Gentlewoman Mary for literature is that she was the primary female poet in England to compose a comprehensive series of sonnets titled from Pamphilia to Amphilanthus.
“In this peculiar Maze how shall I turn/Ways are on all sides”
The depiction of someone who is lost in the maze of love and is urgently seeking a way out is prevalent in the sonnets of the Renaissance. In numerous gardens at this period, there were mazes that functioned as a form of entertainment. Hence, the title of the sonnet personifies the maze in which every admirer wanders. The poetic protagonist depicts the challenging circumstance in which he found himself using the phrase “In this peculiar Maze how shall I turn/Ways are on all sides” (Wroth). Different paths diverge in all directions, but none of them appears correct.
The origins of the maze mentioned in the poem trace back to the legend of Theseus. The hero was rescued by a woman named Ariadne, who provided him with a golden thread so that Theseus could discover a way out of the Minotaur’s maze.
“Leave all, and take the thread of Love”
Nonetheless, Gentlewoman Mary in the sonnet employs a maze to establish a metaphor for suffocation, which suppresses her own aspirations, compelling a woman to remain quiet and engage in domestic duties during the Renaissance. The symbol of contemporary conventions of that era are ruining her and do not permit her to lead a complete life.
The protagonist lacks the liberty to disclose her affection to Amphilanthus, nevertheless, she is incapable of evading her sentiments and pledges to ‘leave all, and take the thread of Love’ (Wroth). This thread signifies divine love for Christ. It enables her to locate the sole path back, yet the thread is excessively delicate and the protagonist can effortlessly stray. Consequently, the maze is not solely a symbol of bereavement, but also a snare in which an individual finds themselves due to their emotions.
The path, the veracity, and the illumination
Additionally, there is a spiritual implication in the sonnet. In the New Testament, Jesus points out that he is the path, the veracity, and the illumination. Consequently, the poetic protagonist’s frustration arises from the reality that the orator is confronted with numerous paths embodying love. Nonetheless, these are all embodiments of one individual's amorous love for another, and none of them are “the path”, signifying the love of Christ.
Ultimately, the protagonist makes her resolution in the third stanza. She comprehends that it appears insurmountable for her to select one path that she will follow and she selects all paths. Thus, the protagonist queries “let me take the right, or left hand way”. She endures her uncertainties and progresses by enduring suffering. Nevertheless, at the conclusion, the attention shifts and the protagonist realizes that she desires to depart from the maze. Consequently, she aspires to pursue the thread of love, regardless of how this journey culminates.
