When it comes to the explanation of bookkeeping, it is frequently defined as recognition, quantification, and subsequent transmission of financial information that empowers its users to make informed decisions. This information pertains to finances and, hence, is displayed in monetary terms. Thus, in accordance with Learn Basic Accounting Easy (2014), bookkeeping is a procedure utilized to supply financial data on the undertakings of profit-seeking enterprises and non-profit organizations. For instance, bank officials can scrutinize a company’s financial records to evaluate its capacity to repay a loan. Potential investors might wish to contrast the accounting information of a few companies to ascertain which one proposes the finest investment. Additionally, business proprietors utilize this information to develop budgets for their organizations.
Fundamental accounting principles can educate one the so-called ‘language of business’ – that is, notions and terms that have been embraced and are extensively employed in the business world. If one comprehends the instructions of accounting information being prepared, it situates them in a favorable position when confronted with a scenario of making a critical decision. Furthermore, there are peculiarities in presenting such data as well: as per AccountingWITT (2010), amid those who might desire to listen to the narrative of a business are internal users, external users, and the government. Despite the fact that the data presented to all these parties is identical, one is to utilize different methods when delivering it to each of them. Managerial accounting is the language with which information is to be communicated to internal users, whereas for external ones, financial accounting is the appropriate manner; with the government, one is to resort to tax accounting. Understanding that makes one a more capable manager and simplifies collaboration with them.
It is apparent that dependable information is crucial in empowering those in authority to make suitable decisions – and having access to such information is the solution. This is precisely why bookkeeping is so crucial – it is the instrument to furnish one with all the data essential to progress in the correct direction when it comes to business-making. It is utilized to evaluate the financial consequences of various options and prudently allocate resources. Accountants are capable of predicting the future: uncertainty is lessened with the use of professional judgment to measure consequences of taking or delaying action. Dunn (2011) asserts that it endows them with significant power as well as with significant responsibility: their errors might be more critical than errors of other specialists. It can lead a business or an organization to failure from which recovery might be challenging.
Enterprises can have numerous aims and objectives. For example, a target of a restaurant’s proprietor may be the enhancement of the building’s physical structure. Nonetheless, the primary aims of each enterprise are profitability and solvency. Profitability is the capability of income generation, whereas solvency is the capability of timely debt repayment. Unless an enterprise can generate a satisfactory income and settle debts until they mature, it will not be able to endure to achieve its other aims (Learn Basic Accounting Easy, 2014). These concepts are mirrored in the accounting formula, which embodies the composition of the corporate financial statements.
Corporate financial statements are documented records conveying the company’s vigor and profitability. According to Dunn (2011), there are four primary corporate financial statements. The income statement is the one reflecting the organization’s profitability. The statement of retained earnings presents a modification in such earnings over a specific period (for instance, month or year). The balance sheet unveils the financial condition and solvency of the company. Lastly, the statement of cash flows encapsulates the organization’s cash flow and outflow over a certain period.
