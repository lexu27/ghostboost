Summary of Services
Children and Adults with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (CHADD) is a group that is committed to assisting individuals affected by ADHD. The organization was established in 1987 following the widespread frustration and isolation that parents faced due to ADHD-affected children. There were no organizations and associations to step in for families with children affected by ADHD during this period. Therefore, CHADD came into being with the main goal of altering ADHD situations, which most individuals misinterpreted as a ‘behavior problem.’ The organization recognizes ADHD as a potentially severe disorder yet manageable.
CHADD is establishing support both for children and adults affected by ADHD (CHADD, 2022). This is a Maryland-based group backing individuals enduring the impacts of the condition. One of the organization’s actions is enhancing children’s educational services and accommodations in regular classrooms.
The organization asserts that children impacted by ADHD have the entitlement to education just like other typical children. Moreover, through a consciousness-raising campaign, the organization has fostered a conducive atmosphere in workplaces for individuals enduring this condition. The historical account of the organization discloses that one parental group in Florida expanded significantly and was rated the top non-profit national organization intervening for children and adults impacted by ADHD.
