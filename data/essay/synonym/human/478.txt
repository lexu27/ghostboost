Philosophical Reflection

It is crucial to acknowledge that philosophy is a field that methodically employs logic to enhance the comprehensive comprehension of existence, actuality, and the essence of knowledge as well as sagacity through a meticulous inquiry. The inquiry into knowledge is closely linked with a division of philosophy known as epistemology. The latter concentrates on safeguarding and scrutinizing the fundamental principles of knowledge, encompassing the central methodological frameworks used to achieve it. Concerning the grasp of actuality itself, the most pertinent division of philosophy is metaphysics. It endeavors to depict the essence of actuality by confronting the underlying issues beyond the capacities of science, yet the principles are firmly based on logic and rationale. Finally, the notions about the virtuous life and correct way of existence originate from the division of philosophy termed ethics. It evaluates and staunchly upholds the crucial principles of worth by ascertaining what is incorrect and right.
Regarding the inquiry of knowledge, Socrates presented robust methodologies to unveil what is true. It should be emphasized that dialectic was a cornerstone of the pursuit of knowledge through sagacity, which is centered on a mutually respectful dialogue between various individuals of differing perspectives to achieve the truth (The Socratic Approach, n.d.). Nonetheless, when it pertains to imparting the known truth to individuals, such as learners, who are unaware, Socrates employed the Socratic Method. The latter concentrated on posing queries about known subjects and pushing the boundaries of knowledge to acquire new ones (The Socratic Approach, n.d.).
Disputes played a central role in the process of organizing and attaining the truth as they were rigorously scrutinized and evaluated in terms of their validity. Even during his final trial and condemnation to death, Socrates adhered to his rationale by demonstrating why death should not be dreaded. He contended that death is either something or nothing; in the former scenario, one can communicate with the deceased, and in the latter scenario, it is dreamless slumber. Hence, both scenarios offer no valid rationale to fear death, making it illogical for him to dread his condemnation (The Apology: A Defense of Philosophy, n.d.).
In the context of the inquiry about actuality, Plato offered insightful knowledge and a framework to grasp the essence of actuality. The philosopher's central assertion regarding metaphysics is rooted in the concept of flux or alteration. His proposition is that the world is continuously changing, rendering knowledge impossible, yet since knowledge is attainable, then there exist some essences beyond the world in the metaphysical realm (Plato Forms: The Foundations of Being, n.d.). Actuality is anchored on forms, which are entities such as prototypes and ideals (Plato Forms: The Foundations of Being, n.d.).
In the context of the inquiry of epistemology, Aristotle presented virtue ethics to differentiate what is incorrect from what is right. It is crucial to highlight that virtue ethics concentrates on character or actor rather than the action itself. He argued that when an individual needs to act, he or she will act in harmony with his or her character (Aristotle’s Highest Good, n.d.). Virtue lies between two extremes, and vice is either insufficiency or excess.
Reflection on Virtue Ethics
Engaging in philosophical contemplation entails thinking systematically with consciousness of the premises and arguments being articulated to arrive at a specific conclusion. Such an approach can greatly benefit me by enhancing my resilience to groupthink, prejudices, and logical fallacies. It deepens my comprehension of what is factual, what is moral, and what is authentic.
The influence of the ideas of the Ancient Greek philosophers on my viewpoints and perspectives is substantial. For instance, virtue ethics educated me that ethics is not dichotomous in terms of one side being wrong and the other side being right. The provided framework indicates that goodness lies between two extremes, which is equilibrium. The notion holds true concerning nearly everything, such as eating, exercising, sleeping, utilizing social media, working, and numerous more. Additionally, the Socratic Method enabled me to engage in dialogue with myself by posing questions about what I know and broadening my knowledge further. For instance, I was able to observe how I subconsciously justify my procrastination, yet posing simple questions can unveil the fallaciousness of the underlying arguments.
Aristotle’s virtue ethics remains valid even in the contemporary era, if not more pertinent. The modern world has reached unprecedented extremes of excess and degeneracy, where our capacity to veer to either extreme is unparalleled. An individual can amass millions of acquaintances through social media, the affluent possess a net worth in billions, certain political leaders can sway the world, one can consume whatever and however he or she desires, people across the globe are grappling with extreme corpulence and starvation, the heightened level of comfort is attained, the pollution impacting the planet, and these are merely a few instances of the extremes of modernity. For example, Aristotle formulated the doctrine of the mean, where he provided the illustration of courage. Excessive courage leads to recklessness since there exists a fine line between valor and foolishness, and the absence of courage results in timidity (Aristotle’s Highest Good, n.d.).
