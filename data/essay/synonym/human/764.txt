The ghost bear, also referred to as aka Kermode bear, is a distinctive animal that dwells in British Columbia. According to Groc (2020), this is the distinct kind of all bears not just due to its ice-cream-colored fur but also because of its habitat and scarcity. A single bear can weigh up to 200; considering that bears generally have from 80 to 600 kilograms, a maximum of two hundred appears to be low (Service, 2017). The Kermode bear is the American black bear's subspecies, but what makes this creature so uncommon is its recessive gene that hues the bears' fur white or creamy (National Geographic, 2017).
The scarcity of this kind lures additional interest in these bears â€“ only 400 ghost bears currently reside in British Columbia (Groc, 2020). According to National Geographic (2017), their populace resides in the Great Brain Rainforest, which represents a 6.4-million-hectare temperate rainforest and is an excellent habitat for this kind of animals. Furthermore, this habitat furnishes ghost bears with suitable sustenance, such as salmon and a variety of berries, insects, plants, fruits, and nuts (Service, 2017). Despite the animal being massive, huge, and sometimes deemed hazardous, it is timid and enigmatic in nature; thus, if not disturbed, the representative of this kind poses no menace (Service, 2017). Nonetheless, the animal is perceived as hazardous solely by tourists; according to Service (2017), indigenous populations view the ghost bear as sacred or holy mainly because of its unusual creamy color. Based on the described traits, it can be inferred that ghost bears are among the most distinct and scarce species on the planet; therefore, they must be safeguarded and their habitat conserved.
