Even though the Beast can be deemed a malevolent character for killing individuals, the entity also possesses positive characteristics. The Beast is characterized as unattractive and robust but simultaneously inexperienced. Initially, Frankenstein’s creation is labeled as “its enormous framework and the distortion of its appearance … immediately informed me that it was the outcast” (Shelley). In spite of his unsightly and frightening look, the entity did not have the desire to harm individuals. The creature can be likened to an infant who endeavors to explore the world it inhabits, and its behaviors are merely responses to the harshness of the world. Frankenstein’s monstrosity is not a genuine monster; it simply craves affection and attention that the world cannot provide. The creature’s sensitivity is a favorable attribute as it enables it to comprehend people’s emotions and empathize with them.
The “Gothic” aspects of the tale encompass paranormal motivations, the construction from the Middle Ages, and the spiritual facets of human nature. Additional “Gothic” elements include the pursuit of knowledge, the Beast, and the potential moral decline of men. I fancy that genre because I enjoy examining diverse matters from varying standpoints. This narrative allows me to scrutinize the deeds of Victor Frankenstein and the Beast and grasp their rationales and emotions. I also value narratives that strive to illustrate ethical facets of society through the use of diverse symbols, like the Beast.
Mary Shelley’s spouse maintained that inappropriate social connections are the consequence of individuals turning wicked. To corrupt individuals, other members of society must shun them and render them feeling useless or malevolent. I concur with this viewpoint, as people’s motives typically stem from their encounters with social engagements. If society treats individuals as if they were offenders, there is no incentive to endeavor to be virtuous or conform.
I am of the belief that one of the fundamental themes of the narrative is solitude. The Beast aspired to assimilate into society; however, people greeted him with revulsion, dread, animosity, and the entire range of adverse emotions. Consequently, the creature transformed into malevolence due to the sensation of solitude. Presently, society frequently endeavors to segregate individuals who do not perceive the world similarly to the majority. This characteristic frequently precipitates the sense of being adrift and solitary.
