Synopsis
Nursing is a frequently underestimated occupation, which is indispensable to a smoothly operating hospital setting. Nursing philosophy has a valuable and recognized impact on the efficiency of the nursing personnel in real-life circumstances (Oducado et al., 2019). Nonetheless, nursing procedures and traditions are most efficient and commonly utilized in everyday situations. However, as the theory-practice disparity remains substantial (Greenway et al., 2019), it is often the scenario that the staff behaves in established ways without comprehending the underlying rationales for the traditions. This can be troublesome for several reasons, including drive and trustworthiness. Initially, the students might view theory as a waste of time and consequently be less eager to learn. Secondly, it could diminish the reliance between the patients and the nurses, as the trustworthiness of the nursing personnel wavers. Lastly, it could adversely impact patient care quality (Salifu et al., 2018) if the nurses are incapable of performing effectively in unfamiliar situations. Therefore, it is crucial to grasp the background of the nursing practices to understand why they are the way they are today, and how to modify them if the situation necessitates an original solution.
Detail the advancement of nursing practice
The nursing field as it is recognized today can be followed back to Florence Nightingale, a nurse in the mid-19th century. Throughout the numerous wars that were to follow in the 20th century, the importance of the profession was magnified, significantly assisting the soldiers. Nightingale had to oppose the societal standards of the period to pursue her convictions that she should be able to aid whom she desires ("How the Evolution of the Nursing Profession Benefits Nurses & Patients Alike," 2019). During the Civil War and the two World Wars, the significance of the nursing profession became indisputable, enhancing the credibility of women inclined to offer help.
Over the years, the nursing profession has been molded and reformed multiple times. Primarily, there is now formal education accessible to those inclined to become caregivers. Based on the theories and practices that have been established, this enables the knowledge to be transmitted securely. Moreover, as the nursing profession became more acknowledged, those linked with it also acquired more responsibilities and duties. It is crucial for nurses to stay alert and effective in their daily decisions, as some of them might be lifesaving. Lastly, there are now safety and quality protocols and benchmarks that confirm that each and every patient gets the finest quality of care.

Mahoney also established the National Association of Colored Graduate Nurses in an endeavor to promote the profession to Black women.

Examine nursing practice in connection with public anticipations and trust
Trust between the patient and the caregiver is crucial in the medical sector. However, it is often the situation that the public perception of the nursing personnel is lower than it should be. Furthermore, it is essential to manage the anticipations that patients have of the nursing staff to furnish them with the finest quality of care. According to Girmay et al. (2018), the poor perception of nurses from the patients is impeding the quality of care. Hence, there is a necessity to tackle these concerns by increasing the visibility of nursing practices and fostering patient-caregiver trust.
