The swift progression of Internet communication technologies necessitates a significant lawful foundation that will tackle all minor facets of the boundary between personal data confidentiality and boundaries for governmental scrutiny. It seems that aside from furnishing the governmental agencies all users’ information upon demand, ECPA (Electronic Communications Privacy Act) permits carrying out inspections covertly, which infringes the citizens’ rights from the First Amendment. Furthermore, several particulars influence the advancement towards more pertinent legal regulations basis for online activities.
Initially, formulating a new lawful foundation for electronic communication demands a intricate approach, as owing to the rapid advancement of communication technologies, the lawful foundation can lose its significance in a brief period. Secondly, the data conveyed and stashed in the online realm is subjected to numerous hazards such as hacking and theft. Moreover, Internet communications present a potential peril to society, as perilous groups utilize internet communications to vend prohibited substances and weapons.
The potential jeopardy to society is typically lower under governmental oversight; nonetheless, the restriction of citizens’ confidentiality leads to reduced levels of liberty in the nation and inadequate safeguarding of citizens’ well-being. While the failure to obtain private information about citizens can diminish the safety levels, the prohibition of gag orders will enable the citizens to be informed of the state’s intrusion in their personal information. Additionally, individuals who intentionally pose a threat to society commonly can utilize various types of untraceable communication. Hence, it is crucial to encompass the warrants for state inspections in the new lawful basis to eliminate the prospect of violation of the privacy of innocent citizens. Consequently, the state’s anxieties about terrorism and crime do not validate the transgression of citizens’ privacy. It is time to amend the ECPA or establish a new lawful foundation for online communication to mirror the swift advancement of communication technologies and afford more liberty to citizens.
Another matter that adds to complexities in the process of revising the current ECPA. In 2013 and 2015, Congress suggested legislation of ECPA revisions, but they never advanced through the legislative process. Even endeavors to create a companion bill to the ECPA, the Email Privacy Act, endorsed by 272 co-sponsors, culminated in fiasco (Pegoraro). President Obama’s administration elucidated that revisions to ECPA will obstruct the state’s law enforcement activities (Pegoraro). According to Calabrese, any slight reforms are challenging to pass, and potential clash of interests with the FBI and law enforcement system (qtd. in Pegoraro). Hence, the measure to revise ECPA was not undertaken due to protracted legislative passing procedures and potential interference with the law enforcement system’s activities.
In conclusion, the instance of Microsoft illustrates why all media organizations should back Microsoft in lawsuits against the United States over the provisions of the ECPA. The enterprises should defend consumer rights more actively as due to legislative process complications, there is no hope for ECPA revisions in the nearest time. The company’s primary aim is to safeguard the customers’ interests and rights provided by the First Amendment, as customers’ backing ensures the media companies’ revenue. With the expansion of cloud technologies and the prevalent use of servers in other countries for data storage, the US government is already encountering difficulty acquiring data from prominent companies. If the present legal foundation is not reassessed in the immediate future, the companies will commence utilizing more servers in other countries to guarantee privacy for their customers. Therefore, either way, the government will unavoidably confront the repercussions of the ECPA revisions and conceivably forfeit access to crucial information that will diminish the citizens’ safety.
