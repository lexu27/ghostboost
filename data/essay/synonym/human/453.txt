The Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a security system that aids individuals in promptly identifying potential security breaches in a device or network. There are various kinds of IDS, with the primary ones being Host-based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS) and Network-based Intrusion Detection System (NIDS). These IDSs concentrate on distinct analytics and data management. The primary benefit of all IDSs is a rapid notification system regarding an attack or file deletion. Streamlining processes and implementing adjustments enables administrators to respond promptly to safeguard information.

NIDS examine incoming and internal network traffic; the objective of the scrutiny is to uncover malicious activities. Nonetheless, when port coverage is deactivated, supplementary sensors need to be set up, and this poses the primary challenge for NIDS (Magalhaes, 2018). This predicament arises because the switch does not directly broadcast the packet across the entire network but solely to the recipient. This arguably complicates the utilization of NIDS, necessitating administrators to undertake additional tasks.

HIDS are instruments that manage the functionality of individual devices. Typically, HIDS monitors the status of all files stored on an endpoint and notifies the administrator when system elements are erased or altered. Furthermore, this type of IDS inspects all data packets transmitted to or from the device (Magalhaes, 2018). HIDS generally holds advantages over NIDS, and administrators ascertain that HIDS is well-suited for laptops, servers, and workstations.

HIDS and NIDS can be evaluated in various manners, and data analysis reveals that HIDS frequently surpasses or is at least comparable to NIDS. HIDS safeguards files even if the administrator is disconnected from the Local Area Network (LAN) because HIDS is directly installed on the device. The beliefs surrounding the versatility of HIDS are also linked to this aspect. Both HIDS and NIDS are equally user-friendly and manageable (Magalhaes, 2018). The primary benefit of HIDS is that training is unnecessary before employing it. This renders HIDS the preferred choice for most administrators, alongside the significantly lower cost of HIDS compared to NIDS. Additionally, NIDS utilizes the LAN bandwidth, which results in heightened demands placed on it.

Administrators are generally advised to utilize HIDS and NIDS concurrently on firewalls and clients, despite the notion that employing solely HIDS might seem logical. In contemporary times, shielding information from intruders is tantamount to safeguarding money from felons. Multiple layers of protection can safeguard the administrator and the files that devices secure. When employing HIDS and NIDS, the former will offer comprehensive protection, while the latter will address local concerns (Magalhaes, 2018). The combined utilization of HIDS and NIDS will furnish a prompt and efficient alert upon detecting a breach.

Logs serve as valuable aids in the utilization of IDSs, documenting all occurrences on the network and device over time. HIDS and NIDS uphold logs with diverse levels of detail. Nevertheless, administrators can adjust the level of detail to prevent being overwhelmed by extraneous data (Magalhaes, 2018). Typically, HIDS maintains highly detailed logs containing information about all machines, even those situated remotely from the network.

When deploying protective antivirus software, administrators must consider supplementary methods to identify intruders seeking to pilfer data. Alarming statistics indicate that over 90% of networks where the IDS and antivirus program were activated harbor security vulnerabilities (Magalhaes, 2018). Despite endeavors to fortify networks, IDS uncovers and flags weaknesses. Concurrently, more than 95% of companies do not invest in the installation and maintenance of IDS, nor do they train employees in operating with IDS (Magalhaes, 2018). Holistic data protection necessitates thorough scrutiny that HIDS and NIDS can deliver, albeit demanding special attention from administrators.
