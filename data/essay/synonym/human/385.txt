Work extortion can be described as the unlawful use of unions and power for self-interest. Union labor dishonesty was carried out by, executed in partnership with, or under the guidance of organized criminal groups. The commencement of the 20th century laid the groundwork for work extortion and evolved into a legal and societal issue (Jacobs, 2020). Until the late 1970s and early 1980s, there was no structured governmental or law enforcement agencies effort to alleviate the problem (Jacobs, 2020).
Amid prohibition, criminal factions opted to generate revenue from vending illegal spirits, which sustained the alcohol demand and profits high. When prohibition was annulled in the 1930s, the mafia's sophisticated business-running approaches persisted (Jacobs, 2020). The most influential factions shifted their attention from alcohol to enterprises, encompassing narcotics, betting, and prostitution (Jacobs, 2020). Nonetheless, these were not the sole lucrative enterprises that contributed to the profit diversification. Among other profitable enterprises for the organized crime was work extortion through the management of labor unions.
There are numerous rationales why gangs favor labor unions to other varieties of unions. For instance, it can be apparent from their decision to govern the Teamsters and International Longshoremen's Association (Jacobs, 2020). Through the resources of such unions, members of Cosa Nostra could readily access all types of lawful enterprises, including garbage disposal, building, or demolition. Furthermore, they had simple entry to healthcare and retirement funds from the unions. These lawful enterprises provided them avenues to not only smuggle illegal substances or individuals but also mask their activities (Jacobs, 2020). Among other offenses, the organized factions conducted extortions or menaced employers, and entreated or received kickbacks.
Therefore, it can be observed that organized crime has consistently attempted to govern local enterprises and expand their sway with the assistance of diversifying their earnings. Among the primary pursuits of gangs were prostitution, drug smuggling, betting, and work extortion. Labor unions were advantageous to organized crime because of the resources they possessed. Such unions granted mobsters entry to lawful demolition, building, and garbage disposal enterprises.
