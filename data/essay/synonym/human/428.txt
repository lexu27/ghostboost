"Interpreter of Ailments" introduces the reader to a crumbling world of a dysfunctional family. In the novel, Mr. Das ignites both compassion and a sense of slight irritation that is likely to turn into disdain after considering the development of his character. Though the character may appear kind and understanding initially, his apparent incapacity to emotionally bond with his spouse or offspring suggests the necessity for further growth, which never transpires.
Initially, Mr. Das embodies a character that is simple to sympathize with and identify with because of his gentle demeanor. Indeed, Mr. Das is mostly kind-hearted and compassionate throughout the novel. For instance, he is never forceful or unkind to his spouse, often being the one to initiate a conflict: “`But they’re harmless,' Mr. Das said” (Lahiri). Nevertheless, Mr. Das should not be viewed as immediately salvageable.
Specifically, upon closer inspection, Mr. Das’ reluctance to engage with his spouse or children becomes apparent. For example, when Mr. Kapasi initiates a conversation with the couple., Mr. Das opts to evade the discussion. In particular, he opts to peruse a book instead: “Mr. Das was engrossed in his guidebook, so it appeared like a private discussion between Mr. Kapasi and Mrs. Das” (Lahiri). Hence, Mr. Das clearly distances himself from his spouse and, by implication, from his offspring, deepening a divide in their relationship.
Consequently, the failure to recognize and confront an issue constitutes a significant hurdle in Mr. Das’ character evolution. Consequently, he remains stagnant throughout the novel, lingering in the same nescient state of blissful ignorance. Thus, his deliberate disregard of his family members' discontent renders him less sympathetic than he initially appeared.
Blatantly failing to perceive the alienation between himself and his spouse, as well as his offspring, Mr. Das evokes sentiments that gradually strip away the reader's anticipated empathy and, instead, portray him as profoundly flawed. Despite the understandable issues in Mr. Das’ perception of his marriage and his offspring, which humanize him and render him relatable, his incapacity, or unwillingness, to acknowledge and address the problem results in the reader's bitter disillusionment. Consequently, with his intricacy and contradictory disposition, Mr. Das and his character trajectory impart an important lesson to the reader concerning the necessity for self-reflection and facing reality.
