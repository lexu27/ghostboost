Health facilities and their personnel ensure to establish efficient emergency readiness and response measures to address disasters, extremist attacks, and global outbreaks. According to McNeill et al. (2018), health emergency readiness is the capability of the public health system and community to prevent and react to medical crises. With sufficient readiness, healthcare providers become better prepared to manage medical crises when they arise. Medical and emergency readiness among rural communities are still deficient despite awareness of upstream readiness and social determinants such as insufficient resources, isolation, and restricted access to healthcare services.

How I Provided Nursing Care that Addressed the Psychosocial Needs of Rural Communities
I delivered nursing care to cater to the emotional needs of rural communities during the pandemic by conducting house-to-house screenings and education on the COVID-19 virus. The highlight of this activity was to dispel the myths and misinformation about the origin of the virus, its transmission, and the negative effects of vaccination. The door-to-door screenings and education played a key role in advocating the necessity for vaccinating rural households. We succeeded in screening 200 individuals in two villages on the first day of the operation, with only 3% declining screening services.
Our healthcare team encountered an elderly patient who was struggling to breathe during the screening services and promptly transported him to the emergency department. Upon arrival, we assessed the patient's condition to determine the seriousness of his situation and later admitted him to the emergency room. I performed chest compressions at the center of the patient's chest to press down approximately two inches. I executed this action with my shoulders directly above my hands while keeping my arms extended to aid in sustaining the patient's life.

My healthcare team offered nursing services that addressed the emotional needs of clients by establishing and expanding telehealth services. The telehealth services encompassed psychiatry involving video communication with rural communities. For example, telepsychiatry services facilitated communication and monitoring of patients through technology in real-time. According to Butkus et al. (2020), video-based telepsychiatry services help meet patients' needs amidst the uncertainties arising from the pandemic at reasonable rates. This intervention was pivotal in integrating behavioral healthcare and primary care to mitigate the spread of the virus.

How Social Determinants Contributed to the Health Status of a Vulnerable Client I Served
Social determinants of health such as destitution, low literacy, and unequal access to healthcare influence healthcare outcomes of vulnerable populations. One of the social determinants of health that impacted the health status of a vulnerable client I served during my practicum was poverty. According to Khan et al. (2018), rural communities subsist on meager wages and face widespread poverty that affects access to care. This social determinant became apparent while I was conducting door-to-door screenings in a mass testing initiative to curb the spread of the virus. I realized that the vulnerable client lacked the means to visit healthcare facilities regularly for screenings and tests. Consequently, the client neglected preventive care and only sought treatment when conditions worsened.

Frequently, individuals in rural communities have low educational achievements and literacy levels. According to McNeill et al. (2018), poor literacy levels are linked to reduced preventive care and increased hospitalizations. While engaging with the rural community during the pandemic, I observed that the vulnerable client exhibited poor compliance with measures such as hand hygiene, mask-wearing, and social distancing to minimize virus transmission. The repercussions of low literacy in this population included heightened hospitalizations and emergency care utilization.

Inadequate insurance coverage among rural communities poses another challenge to healthcare. The vulnerable client I assisted during my practicum was uninsured and did not receive preventive services for heart diseases, cancer, and chronic illnesses. Lack of insurance coverage also deterred the vulnerable client from seeking medical services promptly due to the high associated costs. Overall, limited insurance coverage among rural communities results in insufficient access to recommended care and substandard health outcomes.

The Support Agency I Would Recommend for the Population in Future
The support organization that I would endorse for the rural community in the future is the guide to Rural Health Care Collaboration and Coordination (HRSA). This support organization coordinates the endeavors of community health centers, rural hospitals, local public healthcare departments, and other stakeholders to identify and tackle community health needs (Kearly et al., 2020). HRSA aims to enhance healthcare access by implementing coordination strategies to provide quality care. The support agency will aid rural communities in enhancing their care outcomes by fostering and fortifying care coordination.

The Greatest Concerns about the Rural Population during Natural Disasters
The primary apprehension regarding rural communities is their access to medical services during floods and other natural calamities. Floods lead to a significant surge in the demand for medical services. Rural communities affected by floods encounter disrupted access to healthcare as it damages roads and communication channels. Floods also heighten the risk of infectious diseases by contaminating water and food sources with debris and waste. Rural communities suffer from limited access to medical services due to floods, which hampers their healthcare access.

In closing, challenges such as deficient coordination, limited funding, and geographical obstacles affect the health, healthcare, and emergency preparedness of rural populations. A myriad of factors including environment, income, and literacy influence the health of rural populations. Programs and policies aimed at enhancing rural community preparedness for healthcare and emergencies should concentrate on addressing the underlying healthcare determinants to bolster upstream activities supporting resilience.
