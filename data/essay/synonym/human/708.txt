As a business advisor for Sun City Boards, I would recommend that the company embrace the SWOT analysis as a strategic Management tool. The organization needs to participate in a planning process by commencing with setting concrete goals and defining specific actions that are necessary to accomplish the mentioned goals. Goals are the fundamental basis of planning and are typically obtained from a company’s mission and vision statements (FCSJ., 2021). They elucidate what the company aspires to achieve and not what it can achieve. Therefore, the organization must embrace the SWOT analysis as a strategic management tool for addressing its business issues.
Sun City Boards can utilize the SWOT analysis to capitalize on its own strengths, tackle its weaknesses, mitigate its threats, and exploit its opportunities. The organization’s primary weakness is a lack of planning which impacts its profitability. It must establish explicit goals and objectives that it can utilize as a compass in its business operations. The company also needs to mitigate its threats which consist of competition from other organizations involved in the same product line. It can accomplish this by manufacturing top-notch surfboards that can provide it with a competitive edge. The company can also capitalize on its opportunities by exploring the potential of broadening its product line to capture a vast market (Teoli et al., 2021). It can venture into producing inexpensive boards for the lower segment of the market.
The objective of SWOT analysis is to assist the company in recognizing its strengths and weaknesses, opportunities, and threats in the market. It can also be employed to guide the organization in determining the optimal approach to achieve future growth or manage a current situation to propel the business in the correct direction (Visual Paradigm, 2022). SWOT analysis will enable Sun City Boards to comprehend the significance of establishing goals that are derived from its mission and vision statements. The company will also acknowledge the importance of having mission and vision statements as a planning tool. The SWOT analysis will aid the company in comprehending its position and motivate it to generate ideas and decisions on how to capitalize on its strengths, seize its opportunities, mitigate its weaknesses, and contribute to the development of business opportunities.
