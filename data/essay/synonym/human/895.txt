Technology can be employed in various ways to facilitate cooperation, co-teaching, and documentation between special and general education educators. Tools such as audiobooks, the substitute mouse, and speech-to-text functions can be utilized to offer a better comprehension of the given content by students with disabilities. For instance, children with poor eyesight or retina layering, who may be viewed as disabled, should be supplied with audiobooks or written records of the lecture instead of taking notes. This feature could be reinforced in documentation through the establishment of informative variations of applications for individuals with poor eyesight. Additionally, cooperation and co-teaching necessitate a thorough examination of students’ circumstances; thus, the customization of assignments and the grouping into task forces based on specific criteria can be put into action. Furthermore, co-teaching and collaboration necessitate the exchange of personal student information; thus, ethical and legal standards should be considered. For instance, collaborating educators should not disclose students’ personal data or exploit this data for their own benefit. In this scenario, both special and general education teachers should operate solely on the pertinent information. One approach to ensuring confidentiality is segregating data into pertinent and irrelevant subjects based on the theme of co-teaching and collaboration. Only the data that can be used to discover an individualized approach to the students should be exchanged and deliberated among collaborating educators. In my forthcoming practice, I aspire to execute the Station teaching concept where stations are arranged, and both educators instruct at a station and offer guidance to students. This tactic enables students to access the teachers’ assistance more easily, encourages seeking assistance, and offers students the chance to receive diverse interpretations. This collaborative tactic aids both educators in creating a successful study blueprint, compiling pertinent resources for students, and adapting the educational content according to their students' requirements. For instance, in the situation of adolescents with a strong retina layering, collaborating educators could find a superior resolution for enhancing motivation and efficiency in such students. Young adults with eyesight issues might be provided with special material (video or audio documented or enhanced in a superior online format) supplied by their instructors.
