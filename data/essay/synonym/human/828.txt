The communications conveyed through oral, nonverbal, and paralinguistic methods of communication informed the listeners about the speaker’s concerns. Initially, spoken statements conveyed information about the issues at work and personal life, which held significance for the speaker. The speaker expressed slight worry regarding the problems with colleagues at work by using language to convey his emotions. The paralinguistic messages conveyed through the pitch and intonation of the voice and the pace of speaking revealed additional details about the emotional aspects of the discussed situations. When responding to further inquiries about the speaker’s personal life, he spoke more rapidly and in a higher pitch compared to the paralinguistic characteristics of discussing work. Regarding nonverbal messages, the speaker’s facial expressions throughout the communication conveyed details about positive emotions through smiles and open gestures. Additionally, when faced with uncomfortable or overly personal inquiries, the speaker folded his legs and arms, touched his face, and averted his gaze.

The messages conveyed through oral, nonverbal, and paralinguistic communication were partially congruent with various cases, showing distinctions between the concepts communicated through words and accompanying nonverbal and paralinguistic cues. Indeed, when addressing unpleasant incidents at work, the speaker endeavored to remain composed and assess the situations logically. However, as he spoke, his speech was terse, arms folded, and he frequently shifted his gaze. These nonverbal and paralinguistic messages suggested that the speaker felt uneasy or was less than truthful about the matters being discussed. Nevertheless, in most instances, the three forms of communication channels were employed consistently. For instance, when discussing personal matters, the speaker utilized more elaborate vocabulary, conveyed positive sentiments through words and facial expressions, and employed a higher pitch and a quicker pace of speech.

Possibly, not all the messages have been interpreted correctly and clearly because the process of interpreting others is intricate and multifaceted. It requires considerable practice to recognize distinct patterns and grasp the significance of nonverbal and paralinguistic communication messages. Specific facial expressions, body language, and paralinguistic cues may hold varying interpretations depending on the circumstances or context. Hence, it is crucial to scrutinize all the attributes and numerous factors when 'interpreting' others for consistent and lucid communication.
