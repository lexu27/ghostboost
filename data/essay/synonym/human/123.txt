Preamble
Cannabis has been utilized for various millennia in diverse applications. In the Western world, the initial awareness of its medical benefits came about through the efforts of Professor O’Shaughnessy, who directly observed its therapeutic effects in India (Cerdá et al. 167). Following a series of trials, he commenced administering it to patients with rabies, epilepsy, and tetanus. Throughout the subsequent years, professional opinions have continuously evolved, with debates persisting regarding the balance between advantages and disadvantages. The evidence supporting the medical utilization of cannabis ranges from substantiated clinical instances to speculative contentions. Notwithstanding its extensive historical use and favorable patient feedback across multiple domains, it is crucial to bear in mind that marijuana possesses psychoactive characteristics, necessitating constraints on its distribution. The legal status and accessibility of this remedy remain ambiguous in numerous nations.
Varieties of Medicinal Cannabis
The Cannabis sativa plant encompasses over 100 elements, including terpenes, flavonoids, and - primarily for medicinal intentions - cannabinoids (Ali 25). The most prevalent cannabinoid is delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which exhibits mind-altering traits and can induce euphoria (Grassa et al. 1678). The subsequent prevalent cannabinoid is cannabidiol (CBD), which lacks psychoactive properties. THC and CBD represent the most scrutinized cannabinoids. Data suggests that other cannabinoids and terpenoids might also hold promising medical applications, and the assorted cannabis components potentially function synergistically, reinforcing each other's impact.
Viewpoints on the Legalization of Medicinal Cannabis
Opponents
Within the psychiatric field, there exist adversaries of marijuana usage. They caution that the legalization of cannabis, even with restricted medical and veterinary applications, could easily spiral out of control and fuel further proliferation of substance dependence among the populace (Nosarieme 293). Concerns are raised about the risks of mental ailments and a decline in long-term memory. A worrisome notion is the assertion of marijuana's harmlessness. Apprehensions include the potential surge in the workload of law enforcement agencies, tasked with addressing instances of cannabis usage among detainees.
Research has revealed that teenagers who consume marijuana have reported heightened anxiety and a deterioration in academic performance (Larkin and Madras 590). Colorado pioneered marijuana legalization in 2012 (Page et al. 145). Researchers at the University of Colorado affirmed that post-legalization, the number of individuals admitted to hospitals in critical conditions due to cannabis ingestion tripled (Cerdá et al. 169). Opponents of legalization are resolute in their belief that the legitimization would foster the emergence of an illicit marijuana market. Economically, it proves more lucrative for producers to engage in illegal trade than to comply with state taxation and regulation.
Advocates
Advocates for legislative amendments underscore the imperative of incorporating medical cannabis as an adjunct for alleviating pain associated with various illnesses. Furthermore, they cite the outcomes observed in nations where marijuana prohibition is absent, facilitating a reduction in illicit drug trade (Ali 25). Several studies have indicated a substantial decline in crime rates within U.S. states post-marijuana legalization (Grassa et al. 1677). For instance, in states neighboring Mexico, criminal activities decreased by 13% (Nosarieme 294).
Outcomes of Cannabis Legalization
The pioneering moves were made by Uruguay and Canada, permitting marijuana utilization in 2001 (Larkin and Madras 579). Smoking is only permitted in designated areas for individuals above the age of 18 (Page et al. 138). The official stance of authorities remains neutral. In certain nations, legislation allows for personal possession of marijuana and cultivation of 5 to 15 plants at home for personal use (Nosarieme 292). Post the 2013 legalization of marijuana in Colorado, Georgia, and Washington in the U.S., there was a noticeable decline in individuals seeking treatment at drug rehabilitation facilities (Ali 21). The suicide rate remained relatively stable. Police data indicated enhanced capabilities in investigating severe crimes and enforcing preventative law enforcement measures. Consumption of other narcotics did not surge (as depicted in the graph), while alcohol intake decreased.
Nevertheless, it is crucial to acknowledge the adverse ramifications of marijuana legalization. The Canadian Association of Psychiatrists advocates for restricting cannabis sales to individuals above 25 years of age (Grassa et al. 1669). Physicians assert that the recreational use among young individuals impacts cognitive abilities, memory, attention span, and intelligence adversely. Moreover, marijuana serves as a trigger for individuals predisposed to mental health disorders, including those experiencing work-related stress, tension, and hereditary predispositions.
Utilization of Cannabis in Healthcare
Chemotherapy
Cancer patients undergo courses of chemotherapeutic agents over several weeks. While effective, these drugs are highly toxic, resulting in severe side effects that diminish patients' quality of life. A prevalent issue is intense nausea and uncontrollable vomiting. Patients often struggle with reduced appetite and aversion to food odors, leading to malnutrition and despondency. Occasionally, they discontinue treatment despite the associated life-threatening risks.
Anti-nausea medications alleviate symptoms, but their efficacy is inconsistent, and prolonged use leads to complications. Cannabis has been proposed as a less detrimental alternative. Since 1985, oncologists have been authorized to administer synthetic tetrahydrocannabinol in capsules, yet research by Alfred Chang indicates higher bioavailability through smoking (Larkin and Madras 578). Cannabis alleviates nausea by stimulating appetite (an effect prokinetics lack) and exhibits analgesic properties, potentially enabling the reduction of narcotic analgesics.
Multiple Sclerosis and Epilepsy
The clinical manifestations of multiple sclerosis are varied, contingent on the distribution of myelin destruction foci. Specific therapy is absent, and the condition is irreversible, necessitating the utilization of costly symptomatic agents. Marijuana mitigates tremors and partial coordination loss. Documented cases highlight cannabis's efficacy in managing focal epileptic seizures (Cerdá et al. 171). Even through illicit procurement, cannabis proved more cost-effective than conventional treatments. Its anticonvulsant attributes also aid in managing tremors of diverse etiologies (infections, central nervous system organic pathologies, and dystonia).
Anorexia in HIV/AIDS Treatment
Antiretroviral medications can impede digestion and induce nausea, heightening the risk of malnutrition in already emaciated patients. Cannabis not only stimulates appetite but enhances food palatability and enjoyment. Following studies in 1971, Dronabinol was sanctioned for use in the U.S. owing to its superior safety and efficacy compared to Megestrol (Page et al. 149). The medicinal use of cannabis in anorexia linked with HIV infection, such as Marinol, is permissible in select foreign nations solely on prescription. Many patients resort to smoking marijuana conventionally, affirming its superior symptom relief compared to synthetic analogs.
Chronic Pain
Historically, chronic pain management relied on opiates and synthetic analgesics, culminating in severe complications like gastrointestinal bleeding, ulcers, and renal-hepatic deficiencies. The combined sedative and analgesic effects of cannabis render it suitable for conditions such as osteoarthritis and phantom limb pain post-amputation. While marijuana's pain-relieving potency falls short of opiates, its on-demand smoking
