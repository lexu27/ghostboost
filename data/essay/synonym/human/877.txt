During the prior century, scientific discoveries have substantially altered the way individuals exist in all areas of life. Scientific approaches have also been applied to psychology to fathom human behavior. Science employs organized observation as a means of acquiring knowledge. It is an empirical technique that aids scientists in uncovering more about our biological and physical domain. Science has been utilized to rescue humanity from various disasters and illnesses through findings of vaccines and the ecological revolution. These discoveries rescued millions of individuals from imminent demise caused by ailments that were incurable.
Science encompasses four crucial components, which include:
1. Organized observation. Scientists make observations in a highly structured manner. The observed phenomenon is typically gauged and documented to lessen memory bias, impacting scientific deductions. Most observations are performed in controlled circumstances, which are methodically altered to grasp the phenomenon comprehensively.
2. Hypothesis testing. Hypotheses and theories are devised in a way that can be examined. Testing hypotheses necessitates that experiments be carried out to either validate or disprove the hypothesis. It is an empirical means of affirming the credibility of such hypotheses.
3. Democratic. Scientists frequently partake in debates and conversations concerning their theories and observations. The open expression of scientific ideas aids in bringing out the finest in science. Scientists do not dismiss the efforts of others but engage in criticisms and endorsement of scientific works aimed at enhancing the quality of knowledge acquired.
4. Cumulative. The scientist also utilizes information presented by earlier scientists to build on their works. Science offers a direct path of progress where previous advancements build upon superior and more enriching facts and knowledge.
Some individuals still question psychology as a science because many psychological phenomena like intellect, despondency, and bias are seemingly unobservable. Nevertheless, psychological researchers predominantly concentrate on behavior because individual sentiments and thoughts are imperceptible. Scientists can also monitor the actions of identical and fraternal twins to discern the degree to which social and genetic factors contribute to character. In recent times, psychology has evolved into a complex discipline due to improved study designs, measures, and statistical analyses in scrutinizing human nature (Diener). For example, when examining the emotion of joy, the psychologist can inquire of participants about their joy and prompt them to indicate where their feelings lie on a numerical scale. Scientists can also utilize memory measures based on the notion that sanguine individuals have no difficulty recollecting pleasant memories while pessimistic individuals easily recollect unpleasant occurrences.
Furthermore, psychologists also employ biological measures, including saliva cortisol samples or fMRI images of brain activation. Thus, psychological science is pivotal for formulating interventions that enrich people's lives. Numerous research studies are concerned with determining which therapies are the least and most effective for alleviating psychological disorders. Several studies have demonstrated that cognitive-behavioral therapy is efficacious in aiding individuals struggling with anxiety and depression disorders (Diener). Some other research findings have indicated that certain therapies are detrimental and should be avoided. Therefore, it is imperative to assess the various interventions utilized to treat patients and discard those deemed harmful.
In contemporary times, the convenient access people have to information and explanations leads us to inhabit the "Information Age." It is crucial to assess the quality of information rather than quantity because not all information is reliable. Reliable information is hard to come by in an era replete with false news and deceptive information. In this regard, science's primary duty is to ascertain what type of information to deem as well-informed. It employs observable data to comprehend and elucidate the world in a trustworthy manner. Scientists conclude by using less definite terms that are linked to probabilities. Such a method of elucidating situations is what distinguishes scientific from non-scientific assertions.
Both methods employ induction, which concludes based on particular observations. However, the induction process is considered an unreliable way of furnishing information due to its conflicting outcomes. Scientific reasoning is differentiated from everyday reasoning by specific established features. These features found in scientific theories and data encompass consistency, breadth, simplicity, productivity. There is also another additional feature prevalent in scientific speculation and reasoning, recognized as falsification. Karl Popper rejects statements that did not pass the falsification examination. He deemed such statements as impediments to scientific advancement. Popper contended that there would be only one actual possibility if science demonstrated that all others were false (Erin). It implies that scientists must present all proof to disprove their hypotheses.
Nonetheless, contemporary scientists are more interested in delivering explanations and descriptions for the way things are and not how they are not. There is a necessity to delineate distinct causes and circumstances under which they occur. In this context, it can be stated that proof is linked with deductive reasoning. Deductive reasoning employs general principles that are applied to specific scenarios. If the principles are sound and the argument structure is valid, it signifies that the conclusion is substantiated. A deductive truth is applicable in all circumstances without exceptions. It is among the numerous disparities between conclusions drawn from scientific observations and those derived from personal anecdotes. Well-structured research relies on systematically-recorded observations that represent the population and are of high caliber.
The Null Hypothesis Significance Testing is employed to evaluate the likelihood that the data amassed (observations) would be alike if no correlation existed between the variables in the research study. For instance, a researcher would aim to discover a correlation between class performance and age if one existed, but in reality, no such connection exists. The null hypothesis posits no meaningful connection between academic performance and student maturity. This hypothesis also comprises an alternative hypothesis that the two variables are related. In scrutinizing the two hypotheses, the researcher must compile data and compare what she anticipates to find with what she discovers. The objective of collecting data and making comparisons is to ascertain whether to reject or invalidate the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis. However, research conclusions can be erroneous due to errors. There are type 1 error and type 11 errors (Erin). The type 1 error occurs when the research concludes that there is a correlation between the variables while in reality, there is none. Conversely, the type II error arises when the collected data does not exhibit a correlation between two variables while a correlation exists. Nevertheless, researchers can establish a threshold for type I and type II errors using probability values.
