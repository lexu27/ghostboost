The Coptic faith community has a lengthy history in Egypt. The oppression commenced at the invasion of Egypt by the Arabs and, regrettably, has not ceased to this day. Coptic Christians are frequently singled out for oppression, at times culminating in extremist acts or homicides. On the day-to-day level, Coptic Christians face opposition from the residents of Egypt, regular Muslims (Sherwood, 2018). On a spiritual and more worldwide level, Copts are endangered by extremist groups such as ISIS. They were banished from Iraq and Syria and sought clandestine refuge in Egypt.
Oppression of Copts is prevalent throughout Egypt, supporting the oppression due to the fact that their faith is documented in the passport of Egyptian citizens. This permits Muslim Egyptians to reject the Copts employment opportunities, obstructing their growth of small enterprises. In everyday life, Copts voice grievances about being discriminated against in healthcare facilities, educational institutions, and colleges (Sherwood, 2018). Extremist groups frequently abduct Coptic women and coerce them into marrying Muslims (Sherwood, 2018). The implication of such a union is that a Muslim refuses to wed a non-Muslim woman. Prior to marriage, a Christian woman is obliged to adopt her spouseâ€™s faith. In addition to abductions, radicalized Muslims assassinate church leaders and detonate vehicles and structures that might house Copts.
The essay does not detail the assistance of neighboring nations or any others who wanted to sustain Coptic Christians. Nonetheless, the Copts possess a sizable community comprising of Catholics, Orthodox Christians, and other factions (Sherwood, 2018). It can be inferred that nations refrain from stepping into the dispute as extremists from radicalized factions like ISIS are already implicated. Following the casualties in numerous global regions due to extremists, no administration is willing to interfere. Another explanation for the absence of proactive support is the extensive history of the conflict. The war's history articulates its origins well, and many outsiders interpret the oppression of the Copts as an anticipated occurrence.
