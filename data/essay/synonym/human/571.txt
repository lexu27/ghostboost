Social welfare schemes have consistently supplied revenue and medical coverage for elderly citizens. Though social welfare schemes might appear ineffective as they cannot create significant variations in individuals’ lives and cannot offer extravagant lifestyles, they have a notable impact on combating rises in poverty and inequality levels. As per Greenberg and Page (2018), social security was initially established to function as a supplement to workplace pensions, even though a considerable amount of retirees depend entirely on social security benefits. Moreover, while payroll levies might seem unjust, the uninterrupted stream of finances presents a prospect of a secure future with a minimal level of poverty in the nation. Conversely, Medicare’s primary aim was to supply healthcare to elderly citizens lacking funds for therapy to remove the barriers to affordable medication and achieve remarkable outcomes. Hence, although social welfare schemes may seem ineffective, examining their original intent suggests that they efficiently carry out their roles with restricted resources.
Social welfare schemes are intimately linked with socioeconomic and political pressures. For instance, the first social security scheme in the guise of pensions was granted to Civil War veterans, and the Great Depression triggered an upsurge of discussions on strategies to enhance economic security for the elderly. Socioeconomic and political forces can also impact social welfare schemes as political and economic factors dictate the continuity of social security schemes. Social welfare encompasses the ethical aspect of governmental management and thus relies on the fundamental principles of the government. The policy decisions determine the labor circumstances, retirement age, and payroll tax rates in line with prevailing economic situations. Hence, adverse trends in the economy or governmental alterations involving modifications in the administration’s fundamental principles can detrimentally affect social welfare schemes.
