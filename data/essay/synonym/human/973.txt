Swimmer Lia Thomas enrolled at the University of Pennsylvania as a scholar. In 2021, the press highlighted her accomplishments in athletics as a transgender woman. Lia Thomas, a novice contender in the women’s category, had a remarkable performance. Early in December, she achieved her top university outcomes of the year in Ohio, when she participated in the two hundred and five hundred meter dashes. After Lia Thomas’ achievements at college swimming facilities, she faced backlash following the revelation that she was born a male, which granted him an edge. Some individuals contended that since Thomas was undergoing testosterone therapy, he possessed an unjust advantage over other competitors. Branding her triumph as unjust was entirely incorrect considering that transgender individuals are always permitted to compete on their own. Several proposals have been suggested, such as establishing a transsexual division in the NCAA if transgender individuals possess such an unfair advantage. Men compete with men, women compete with women, and transsexuals compete against each other.
Thomas’s accomplishments in the prior seasons are proof of his diligence and commitment. He has demonstrated that transgender athletes can also be as triumphant as anyone else and should be admired for their feats. Nevertheless, the reality is that Thomas has been subjected to all the same examinations and rules as any other athlete. He was not permitted to consume more testosterone than any other male athlete, and his testosterone levels are closely supervised by officials. A year-long regimen of testosterone-suppressing therapy was recommended in accordance with NCAA guidelines for the swimmer’s recuperation. These constraints have been considered inadequate by the Women’s Sports Policy Task Force, for instance, in the event of athletes who initiate their transition after puberty.
