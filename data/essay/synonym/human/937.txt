The aim of cultural criminology is to investigate and portray delinquency and forms of crime control as cultural commodities. Criminality and participants in crime control are perceived as innovative concepts that can be articulated in symbolically mediated cultural routines. Consequently, subculture members, policymakers, media creators, commercial entities, and other pertinent participants offer significant justifications for their behaviors. Cultural criminology views its duty as the scrutiny of the ongoing process of interpretation, reinterpretation, and deconstruction (Wickert, 2019). The theory does not consider itself a theory of crime in a strict sense; rather, it is a paradigm or viewpoint of crime as a phenomenon, placing considerable emphasis on the importance of images, symbols, and representations of self-presentation. Cultural criminology qualitatively depends on the social sense drawing meanings and methods of ethnography as well as textual and content analysis.
Hence, the primary distinction between cultural criminology and other theories of crime is that it positions criminality and regulation within a particular context that can be interpreted differently when observed from diverse viewpoints. In other words, the theory perceives crime and the relevant agencies and institutions of crime control as cultural commodities or as innovative constructs. Therefore, corruption must be addressed from the perspective of the meanings that it conveys. To facilitate an understanding of cultural criminology, it is crucial to contemplate concepts such as crime as culture, culture as crime, the media constructions of crime control and corruption, and the political aspects of culture, crime, and cultural criminology.
Crime as culture involves the portrayal of deviant subcultures as systems of symbols, which may encompass the style and appearance of their members, slang expressions, as well as any signs, slogans, and other methods of differentiation. In this context, crime as culture implies that individuals belong to a subculture that necessitates one’s ability to construct and deconstruct the system of collective codes and practices. Moreover, within the subculture that regards crime as part of its defining culture, symbolic communication may also frequently transpire alongside face-to-face interactions.
Culture as crime is a thematic field of cultural criminology that encompasses the criminalization of cultural products and actors. The examination of the area relies, on one hand, on the distinction between the so-called high culture and, on the other hand, popular culture. Criminalizing cultural products and the various forms that it assumes mainly impacts popular culture. However, it is essential to acknowledge several isolated instances in which criminalization also affects the products of the so-called high culture. For instance, the photographs captured by Jock Sturges and Robert Mapplethorpe were labeled pornographic despite their intention being artistic expression. Conversely, the stigmatization and criminalization predominantly impact artists belonging to social minorities and subcultures, such as black rap musicians, punk musicians, LGBTQ artists, and others.
The third thematic focus area, media constructions of crime control and crime, concentrates on the analysis of reciprocal action mechanisms of the judicial system and the media. Drawing from the studies of Cohen and Becker, concepts like moral panics and folk devils have been extensively highlighted in the media. An illustration of the media construction of crime and crime control relates to the Satanic panic, a national hysteria incident that dominated the media in the 1980s (Hughes, 2016). The episode involved the intense moral panic associated with over twelve thousand unsubstantiated satanic ritual abuse cases in the United States during the 1980s (Hughes, 2016). The issue with satanic panic pertains to the excessive media coverage of the alleged abuse of satanic rituals, with the information not being verified or obtained from unreliable sources. Consequently, due to the interdependence between media coverage and crime, particularly concerning the determination of which crime phenomena should be covered and which should be ignored. In the thematic area of media constructions of crime control and crime, it is imperative to consider media’s construction of crime as a form of entertainment.
The thematic area of focus, which involves the political dimension of culture, crime, and cultural criminology, is preoccupied with the analysis of power dynamics in which social control, media, and crime intersect. Specifically, deviant subcultures become subjects of official surveillance and control or are subjected to a process of commercialization. In the context of “cultural wars,” the art establishment that includes alternative artists debates the aesthetic value of works. Nonetheless, opponents of such art label this alternative art as criminal and take legal actions against artists. The censorship affecting politically motivated artists presents an extreme case of the debates regarding artistic interpretation from the dominant perspective. Mass media has excelled in highlighting crime and social control by focusing on or neglecting specific themes. For instance, there is currently a plethora of TV series (e.g., Making a Murderer, the Night Stalker, Tiger King, The Jinx, and others) in which crime is examined from a cultural viewpoint. In Making a Murderer, for instance, life in rural Manitowoc is depicted as rife with crime due to the low quality of life and inadequate education levels of the populace. In The Jinx, a critique of the norm of the affluent and influential being able to evade justice for an extended period is articulated.
Cultural criminology differentiates itself from the general theory of crime through its key concepts. For example, the theory focuses on terms such as transgression, carnival of crime, and edgework. During festivities, the established norms of power relations are disregarded, including class discrepancies, gender disparities, with the social order being flouted, and no repercussions anticipated for irrational and baseless behavior. Criminological verstehen, derived from the writings of Max Weber, is concerned with comprehending social action as an indispensable element of social progress (Ferrell, 1997). The emphasis is placed on actors and their relevant constructions of meaning underlying their actions. Lastly, the term style is also accorded significance as pertinent to the theoretical tradition of symbolic interactionism. According to the theory, interactions are distinguished by specific symbols utilized for self-expression, primarily in relationships, social entities, and situations.
Although cultural criminology does not assert itself as an autonomous and self-sufficient approach to exploring crime, it has faced some critique. For instance, it is deemed too generic while the methodological approach is perceived as too capricious, with crimes purportedly being trivialized. Despite the criticisms, in the present environment, particularly with the heightened interest of media in crime, cultural criminology furnishes a platform for investigating the interplay between crime and culture in contemporary society.
