Large Corporation in Contemporary Times
The essence of Justice Stevens’ viewpoint in Citizens United versus Federal Election Commission is that entities are legally formed entities that conduct operations and are granted specific legal protections comparable to those given to individuals. The government establishes their rights and privileges (Massey, 2016). According to Justice Stevens, the court’s majority ruling to reverse a century of statutory limitations on election spending by corporations and unions is based on the First Amendment’s safeguarding of the right to free speech, which pertains solely to real individuals and groups of people.
Companies surpass the nineteenth century, but their current manifestation and engagement in the society, political, and economic policy transformed and evolved so drastically in the past era that it is challenging to grasp. Contemporary social change without assessing the significance businesses have had in cultural and social structure transformation (Massey, 2016). They possess and administer the majority of the world’s wealth; they are a cornerstone of the economy and a means for amassing wealth.
The Corporation’s History of Transmission
In 1600, the British, the Dutch, and other prosperous trading companies operated under state charter to raise funds for voyages, facilitate trade, and combat any opposition they faced from other states’ trading companies and the inhabitants at the sites of their ventures. The British East India Company, a privately owned enterprise, had over two hundred and fifty thousand soldiers under its command at one point to fulfill its objective of establishing dominance over the world (Massey, 2016). The British monarchy, like the Dutch crown, leased or delegated the empire to private enterprises.
How Large Corporations Influence Social Change
In at least five aspects, big enterprises are a driving force behind social change. First, the companies are deeply engaged in repurposing and discovering alternative uses for old technology and creating innovations that aid and steer what we do as consumers. Secondly, companies have organized and opposed labor for over a century, defining how work should be executed and the norms governing professional life (Massey, 2016). Third, the management of funds and the purposes for which funds are utilized determine their size and financial stability.
Fourth, huge enterprises influence the physical environment with their brands, products and services, and the appeals that motivate individuals to engage to the maximum of their capacity in the realm of product consumption and beyond (Massey, 2016). Finally, corporations are crucial to the political system, playing a significant role in advocating for legislation that benefits them and opposing policies that would restrict or hinder their capacity to operate as privately owned, profit-making enterprises.
Economic liberalization or deregulation of financial activities, for example, having the government do nothing. Those are some of their goals in state intervention. Data and research are marshaled to demonstrate that any constraints or regulations are futile. Sometimes it is preferable for major firms that the issue never receives attention, rather than pushing back against unwelcome suggestions regarding how the government should address such matters (Massey, 2016). Any hint of trouble is dismissed simply as a non-issue or something that falls outside the government’s purview.
Large Corporations and Opposition to Social Change
There are obstacles to social transformation in the major corporations, just as there are instances of resistance to technology, social movements, and other agents of social change (Massey, 2016). There is also resistance to the trend of societal transformation due to corporate practices. Nonetheless, large firms are expected to maintain their affairs because they are part of the existing condition.
For years, reporters and researchers sought to understand why corporations resist or weaken measures to limit their control over resources (Massey, 2016). Public interest groups have suggested curtailing their influence over tax policies and economic legislation, enacting more regulations, and enhancing oversight and community supervision. Corporations often successfully rebuff these regulations and any changes to their operations, whether acting independently or through trade associations.
The Strong States and Social Change
The scope of the nation’s expanded significantly with the exception of rebels and denial, no one within the ideological spectrum, independent and preservation argued that the government should provide security and physical protection for its citizens or involve itself in warfare. The modern nations created and preserved the value of the currency and managed finances. States constructed and operated educational institutions, bridges, roads, sewage treatment plants, and airstrips; it was a move that was considered the culmination of the Iris Summers era (Massey, 2016). The United States upgraded hospitals, enhanced public amenities, and extended people’s rights, which proved to be a major driver of social change as it offered solutions to the issues facing its citizens.
Public Health; Reducing Disease and Accidental Death as a Public Good
The mortality rate in women giving birth was approximately one thousand for each delivery. The state developed vaccines for various childhood illnesses in the research facilities, the government vaccination programs rapidly expanded. In 1950, the United States distributed polio vaccine to the public through state health programs. Around three million individuals die in automobile accidents (Massey, 2016). Public health programs should focus on speed limits, improved driving, stringent enforcement of traffic regulations, and enhancements in driver education and training.
National Progress through Control of Nature
The United States viewed the waterway utilized for transportation as a communal good. For instance, the construction of levees to manage the flooding of the Mississippi and the extensive dam construction projects on nearly every major river in the West represented an exertion of human control over nature (Massey, 2016). The reclamation of the wilderness enabled the state to assert control over the regions and the resources for development and displaced, relocated, and marginalized indigenous individuals with significant disruption and brought individuals of European descent to the regions.
The Judicial Route to Civil Rights
The state employs significant methods such as enacting and enforcing laws to promote social change. The legal systems carry out crucial functions to ensure that cases adhere to legal precedents and the civil liberties enshrined in the bodies of law (Massey, 2016). Sometimes the court attempts to catch up with people’s ideas and evolving practices. However, the court's decisions are part of social change, especially when citizens and large corporations fail to stand up for the people’s rights. The United States faced challenges, but it was imperative for the judicial system to overcome the stalemate and ensure an equitable society.
State-Driven Social Change in Modern China
The foreign domination that led to discrimination against the military and economic decline in China over the past two centuries diverted the nation from nation-building and eradicated the traditional and social advancement (Massey, 2016). Leaders from the Chinese Communist Party strengthened the nation and eliminated deficiencies and universal weaknesses. Leaders with visions to create a stronger nation and address all aspects of life had the opportunity to lead the Chinese Communist Party and implement economic and social reforms.
