Blues-inspired verse mirrors the connection between literary art and musical heritage that arises from the early 20 th century. Most scholars in this field, such as Tracy (1981), assert that blues-inspired verse originates from the hardship and culture of African Americans. These individuals conveyed their perspectives and worries through the tunes of blues, which swiftly resonated with the audience. Naturally, these facets transitioned into poetry, establishing a distinctive style that melds the thematic components of blues with the poetic tradition of literature. Blues poetry is akin in style to blues music in that it eschews incorporating a range of intricate language structures and refined rhymes. Instead, blues poetry is recognized by repetitive verses that underscore the emotional weight of the writer, as well as frequently simplified grammatical and lexical composition. Notably, these characteristics do not suggest that blues poetry is basic or primitive in any way. On the contrary, these pieces are distinguished by a profound level of emotional intensity, which is further heightened by the authentic quality of the storytelling.
Blues poetry is a prevalent aspect of the initial decades of the 20 th century and it is closely linked to the names of esteemed authors of that era. More specifically, Tracy (1981) and other researchers accentuate the impact made by Langston Hughes and Sterling Brown who essentially defined the genre as it exists today. Nonetheless, blues poetry is not confined to their literary creations, as several other writers contributed to the evolution of this form. Additionally, blues poetry endures even today, and this is due to the timeless nature of its themes. This form of expression addresses human strife, suffering, dependency, intimate relationships, and mortality, which are subjects that are not at all exclusive to the origins of blues poetry.
After exploring numerous works within this genre, I was particularly struck by a composition from the 1920s. James Weldon Johnson (1927) composed a piece titled Go Down, Death . As the title implies, the piece thematically delves into the sorrow of an individual over a cherished one. The recurring segment of the poem reads as follows:
“Do not lament, do not lament,
She is not deceased;
She is at peace in the embrace of Jesus.”
Johnson grieves the loss of a woman, endeavoring to solace himself by seeking divine significance in the calamity. He narrates a tale of how God dispatched Death after sister Caroline who was “fatigued” and “exhausted”. Evidently, the woman faced her share of hardships in life, and now Johnson suggests that God has chosen to relieve her of the burden. This piece is imbued with sorrow and poignant optimism, conveying intense sentiments through relatively uncomplicated language. It is a profoundly engaging and recommended work of blues poetry that captures the essence of the genre.
You won’t anticipate it, no
Nobody will anticipate it
It arrives unexpectedly by day or by night
All you can do is remain seated firmly
He desires your grandmother, indeed
He desires to claim your neighbor
Do not assume that you are too sly
Do not assume that you are too astute
I encountered him once and it was alarming
I encountered him once, yes, it was alarming
He had me stuttering like never before
‘What is your name?’, I inquired
and he replied, ‘COVID’
