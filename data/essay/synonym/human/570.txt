The discrepancies among the opportunities of ordinary citizens and the inhabitants of the Capitol reveal the serious problem of social class variances in The Hunger Games. Nevertheless, the most unfavorable aspect that occurs to individuals is that they are exploited for the amusement of those from the upper class. Overall, Suzanne Collins emphasizes the social inequality between the inhabitants of the twelve districts of Panem and the wealthier segment of society in the Capitol, concentrating on the harshness of the so-called hunger games.
To start with, the narrative centers on two figures, Peeta and Katniss, who reside in the twelfth district of Panem and endure the cruelty of the Capitol. More precisely, their neighbors are famished and must toil diligently to earn money merely to sustain their families, “District Twelve. Where you can starve to death in safety” (24). Katniss’s family is extremely impoverished, so she is compelled to hunt in illicit territories to procure food for her sister and mother. The girl’s family lacks amenities in their residence, so they are unable to even bathe or adequately launder their garments. Additionally, the twelve districts are prohibited from engaging in any interaction, so individuals are unable to journey beyond their regions or acquire food, attire, and other essentials in the various parts of Panem.
In contrast, the Capitol is prospering while the denizens of Panem labor strenuously to subsist. In reality, the upper class harbors no concerns regarding them lacking provisions, designer clothes, or technology to lead their optimal lives. Conversely, nearly every denizen of the Capitol possesses an elegant automobile, estate, and everything that individuals from the twelve districts could not even envision. The capital is populated by malicious and deceitful individuals; they prioritize appearances and attire over character, “They perform surgery in the Capitol to make individuals appear younger and slimmer” (124). Consequently, Collins underscores the primary objective of the Capitol, which is deteriorating the lives of Panem and inflicting suffering upon people (38). The twelve districts do not even have the opportunity to access decent education because the Capitol cannot tolerate any rebellion on their side or individuals that may question their authority.
Nonetheless, the principal annual diversion for the inhabitants of the Capitol is hunger games, which comprise selecting two delegates from each of the twelve districts to battle for their survival. This competition concludes when only one individual out of the 24 contenders succeeds in surviving. Ironically, Catniss is compelled to take the place of her sister, who is arbitrarily chosen during the ceremony to partake in the hunger games. Catniss and her comrade struggle for their lives while the Capitol merely observes their ordeals on the television, exclaiming, “Happy Hunger Games! And may the odds be ever in your favor” (78). The most distressing aspect is that the upper class deems it a genuine honor for the participants to be observed and, furthermore, supplied with essentials during the games if they are backed. In general, the Capitol prioritizes solely its welfare and exploits ordinary individuals from the lower classes across the districts for entertainment, where they hunger, evade snares from adversaries, and slay merely to endure this atrocity.
In conclusion, Suzanne Collins portrays the realism that the people of Panem are confronted with on a daily basis, endeavoring to survive and provide for their families while the Capitol flourishes at their expense. The capital residents perceive themselves as superior entities and believe it is appropriate to torment the same human beings as them merely for their pleasure. The perpetual dread of the Capitol looming over Panem renders Catniss a valiant hero who combats for her people and does not dread forfeiting her life in the process.
