Unemployment is a notable societal and economic issue. Not always beneficial aspects of business growth help reduce the percentage of jobless individuals. The adverse influence could accumulate alongside occurrences like rising prices, external elements such as the global outbreak. Challenges in accessing education for low-income households further widen the disparity between the affluent and the impoverished, which in the United States is already the most extensive globally (Telford, 2019). Consequently, the primary reasons for unemployment include rising prices, sophisticated technology, and inadequate education or expertise for work.

Inflation pushes up costs within the economy. Naturally, the cost of both goods and the components they are made from rises. Employers aim to recover from inflation by consistently enhancing the financial results of sales. One of these approaches is to boost the gross profit margin by cutting production expenses. Consequently, the company strives to streamline expenses by reducing salaries and cutting back on various staff perks. This unjust practice results in workforce reductions.

One of the paths of technological progress, which currently significantly influences unemployment, is mechanization. Substituting human labor allows companies to eradicate human error, enable continuous robot operation, and cut jobs. Economically, numerous skilled professionals from the past view their positions as outdated and end up unemployed. One possible solution to this predicament is to retrain as a consultant to maintain such machinery.

The absence of skills can stem from various causes, ranging from income inequality that restricts educational access to a company's narrow field of expertise that necessitates training. On-the-job learning, in turn, involves the expenditure of human and time resources, which could impact the company's functioning. Consequently, numerous businesses do not provide training but expect to hire a competent specialist demanding a high wage right away. Applicants lacking these competencies are compelled to stay unskilled, fueling the surge in unemployment and scarcities.
