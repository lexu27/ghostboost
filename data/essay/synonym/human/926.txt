The viral pandemic that commenced in February 2019 became a catastrophe for millions of individuals worldwide and altered the lives of billions. Elevated mortality rates and the swift dissemination of the virus jeopardized the well-being and survival of individuals, leading to escalating and uncertain job cuts. Physicians and nurses assumed the general duty to halt the pandemic, risking their lives. Technology played a distinct role in the battle against the virus when scientists initiated the quest for resolving current issues. This article contends that technological transformation has not intensified globalization or weakened the significance of the nation-state but was utilized as an efficient instrument to combat the virus.
Over the past three years, not all members of society could entirely comprehend the danger brought by the illness. For numerous individuals, the challenges of declining economic activity or revenue from the tourism sector were no less of a worry than the immediate threat posed by the virus. Public attention has been excessively concentrated on societal matters, including lockdown constraints. Despite the evident triumph over the disease following the creation of vaccines and the widespread inoculation of the populace in 2021 in the United States, China, India, and other nations, new variations of the virus rapidly propagated due to inadequate restrictive travel measures.
Presently, the omicron variation of the virus presents no less severe peril than prior strains. The transmission of the virus in Singapore persists, with the latest reports citing 15,000 verified cases daily (“Singapore could see more than 15,000 COVID-19 cases,” 2022). Health authorities and governmental officials are encouraging the public to receive vaccinations, as most new instances of illness arise among unvaccinated individuals (“Singapore could be ‘halfway or more’ through its current COVID-19 surge,” 2021). Singapore is among the nations where technology is actively utilized to enhance patient safety. For instance, in 2020 a SARs testing apparatus was initially employed to obtain biological material from the nasal cavities (“How did Singapore invent and innovate during COVID-19,” 2021). Specialists observe that this technological advancement is highly effective, as it diminishes the chances of infection and ensures superior conditions for patients’ care.
Broadly, lessening direct interaction with covid-positive patients is imperative to enhance daily operations. For instance, at Singapore Alexandra Hospital, a unique robotic mechanism was utilized to examine COVID-19 patients in isolation (“Alexandra Hospital using robot technology,” 2020). The robot resembles a tripod on gyroscopic wheels with a monitor and control knobs and maneuvers along the hospital corridors from section to section. This technological innovation enables physicians to visit patients without contact and engage in a more relaxed setting.
Similarly intriguing, in 2020, the Singapore Tourism Board resolved to utilize technology to bolster the sector's resilience. Experts remarked that touchless technologies could be employed to make purchases or settle payments for transport services (“COVID-19: Singapore Tourism Board,” 2020). Particularly, these could be touchless immigration checkpoints to diminish the contact points and facilitate travel for citizens. Significantly, IT systems created to improve the operations of governmental agencies contribute to enhancing the document reporting procedures (Ong, 2020). These tools are employed to handle extensive volumes of data as part of the strategies implemented to surmount the pandemic crisis. For instance, public health agencies may analyze case data daily or track population vaccination rates. Considering the aforementioned, the use of technology in Singapore does not undermine but reinforces the significance of the nation-state.
Hence, the methods in which social amenities in Singapore apply technology were deliberated. Interestingly, the utilization of technology does not dismantle but maintains the pertinence of the nation-state. Technologies also do not heighten globalization but rather are utilized at an international level since they possess universal functions. For example, automatons can be utilized in healthcare to decrease the risk of infection. Contactless payment gadgets are also employed to address the concerns in the travel and transportation sector. Consequently, technologies can be employed in all sectors to tackle the pandemic crisis.
