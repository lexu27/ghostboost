The nation under assessment is Mexico as depicted by its renowned resident – Mexican bard and author Octavio Paz. The writer showcases his viewpoint on Mexican lifestyle and culture in his influential article The Maze of Isolation. This examination would concentrate on the essay’s Section 3 devoted to celebrations in general and the Day of the Deceased particularly, which mirror numerous national traits of Mexicans.

Celebration or festivity is an exceedingly crucial cultural notion for Mexicans. As per Paz (1961), their “schedule is packed with celebrations” (p.47). One might debate that every society has holidays, and there is nothing remarkable about Mexicans also possessing such. However, Paz distinguishes several distinctiveness in how his countrymen revel and perceive their festivities compared to inhabitants of other nations. The author also remarks on the specific rationales for Mexicans’ enthusiasm for extravagant ceremonies and celebratory occasions.

Life occurrences frequently shape artists’ creations, and Paz was not an exemption. His family had encountered a lot during Mexican Civil War and was rather indigent (Brittanica). Nonetheless, Paz had entry to his grandfather’s extensive library, where he acquired knowledge and subsequently succeeded in acquiring an education and initiated releasing his poems (Brittanica). What is crucial to mention is that Paz toured and toiled in various nations, including Spain, France, and the US. It enabled him to scrutinize his homeland both from internally as its inhabitant and from externally as an individual, who had dealings with foreigners, observed other lifestyles, and discovered diverse perspectives. One can garner more insights about something when one possesses alternatives to juxtapose it to. The same applies to the culture: one cannot wholly value the virtues about one’s culture and be critical of unfavorable ones if one is ignorant about others. Therefore, Paz’s outlook on Mexican culture is so precise and valuable.

In Section 3 of The Maze of Isolation, Paz elucidates Mexicans’ fondness for exuberant rituals, ceremonies, and festive activities. Moreover, he remarks on several paradoxes linked to Mexican attitudes towards holidays that frequently perplex the foreigners. For instance, The Maze of Isolation elucidates why Mexico squanders so much money on seemingly purposeless and ineffective celebrations. Another paradox clarified by Paz is the peculiarly festive and cheerful approach Mexicans commemorate the Day of the Deceased.

Paz expounds the core and the distinctiveness of Mexican fiestas through several cultural notions. The initial one is the admiration of the present moment. Paz (1961) observes that during celebrations, “time halts completely” and reverts to its primary state: “the present, in which past and future are harmonized” (pp. 47-48). Fiestas enable Mexicans to relish and value what they already possess instead of fretting about tomorrow beyond our grasp (Paz, 1961). It might appear impractical, as one ought not completely forsake all thoughts and schemes concerning the future or cherished memories from the past. Nonetheless, what one can learn from such an attitude towards time is that excessive concerns about the past or the future cause individuals to overlook crucial life moments and neglect actually relishing their life.

Another crucial observation Paz makes in this chapter is that fiestas might be the means for Mexicans to evade solitude. The author notes that Mexican celebrations invariably encompass extensive throngs of people. In Paris or New York, one might witness substantial congregations as well, but, as Paz (1961) underscores, “the deficiency of people, in the sense of a people, is noteworthy” there (p.48). Unlike such congregations, where individuals would still cluster in small groups and might be solitary even encircled by a multitude, Mexican fiestas “shape a vibrant community” (Paz, 1961, p.48). Hence, it is unfeasible to feel lonely on such occasions.

Mexican fiestas are not only packed but also brimming with noise, vitality, and even aggression. Paz (1961) expounds it as a necessity for Mexicans to liberate pent-up emotions: both affirmative and pessimistic. Hence, everything appears to be magnified during fiestas: “the quiet Mexican whistles, shouts, sings, fires off fireworks, discharges his pistol into the air” (Paz, 1961, p.49). Paz (1961) adds that by executing all of this, the Mexican “discharges his soul” (p.49). Though it is preferable to shun the aggressive activities transpiring during fiestas, the general approach Mexicans release their pent-up sentiments seems notable.

The sum of money Mexicans squander on celebration astonishes foreigners. Moreover, they are astounded when they observe the festive ambiance during the holidays or rituals connected to death. Paz (1961) expounds that both of these cultural templates adhere to the same principle: “everything lures its opposite” (p.50). Therefore, for Mexicans, extravagance is a means of alluring money, and commemorating death is the means they greet and promote rebirth.

Mexican fiestas are disorderly, but Mexicans embrace this kind of disorder. It enables them to free themselves from societal norms, traditions, statutes, and from themselves (Paz, 1961). They can cast away their identities and feign another person. As “the customary hierarchies disappear,” everyone becomes equal and emancipated during fiestas (Paz, 1961, p. 51). Thus, fiestas can be perceived as a means to bring individuals of diverse social statuses closer to each other.

In conclusion, Octavio Paz’s The Maze of Isolation provides the readers with a concise overview of Mexican culture and worldview. Mexicans’ attitudes towards fiestas encompass invaluable lessons: admiration of the present, the significance of companionship, and liberated expression of emotions. Mexicans also discerned a mystical connection between the converse life phenomena and employed it in their rituals: they squander money to allure them or celebrate death to incite rebirth. Moreover, fiesta can be regarded as a minor revolt against established norms: all participants relinquish the acquired statuses but acquire the sense of equality and companionship, which is intricate to sense in other circumstances.
