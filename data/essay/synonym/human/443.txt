With the present wide variety of species, along with the emerging news about the species that are on the brink of extinction due to the impact of the changes in the environment, one might think that finding new animals is no longer a possibility. However, new species are still unearthed regularly, the recent remarkable discovery being an instance of that. Specifically, the Nimba myotis, also recognized as the fuzzy orange bat, or Myotis nimbaensis, has been identified as a new species this year (Simmons et al., 2021). Having orange fur with black pigmentation, Nimba Myotis represents a rather extraordinary specimen of bats. The creature favors natural caves as the place where it lives and rests. Like other bats, Nimba Myotis utilizes laryngeal echolocation as the means of identifying and capturing prey in the dark. Nevertheless, due to the species in question being under researched, its diet is mostly unknown (Simmons et al., 2021). In general, the bat represents a distinct specimen in its class.
The species belongs to the animal realm, specifically, to mammals of the Chiroptera order and the Vespertilionidae family (Simmons et al., 2021). The primary justification for categorizing it in the animal realm is the truth that Nimba Myotis is a mammal. Additionally, the specified species reproduces sexually, unlike members of other realms, and is multicellular (Simmons et al., 2021). Moreover, the reality that cells in Nimba Myotis lack cell walls, permits categorizing it with other species in the Animal realm. Thus, the bat should be described as an animal, specifically, a mammal. Moreover, one should observe that, as a bat, Nimba Myotis represents the largest order in the mammal class following rodents (Simmons et al., 2021). In general, the discovery of Nimba Myotis has illuminated a lot of information on the species of bats, in general.
