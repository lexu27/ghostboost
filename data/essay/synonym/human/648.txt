Kaplan examines the depiction of women in a movie utilizing Laura Mulvey’s The Male Gaze theory and psychoanalysis. Kaplan contends that historically women have only been the focal point in the melodrama genre, and while melodrama reveals the constraints that the family imposes on women, it also compels women to acknowledge those constraints as unavoidable and typical. Kaplan argues that culture is profoundly ingrained in male and female dominance-submission patterns. The male gaze demands a sexual, political gaze and provides a sexualized way of observing that empowers men and dehumanizes women. In the male gaze, a woman is visually placed as an object of heterosexual male desire. Her emotions, ideas, and sexual wishes are less significant than her framing of male desire.
The Postman Always Rings Twice (1946) is a renowned instance of the male gaze. The spectator is introduced to the lead character of the movie, Cora Smith, concentrating on her sensuality. Indeed, the spectator recognizes that Cora is attractive even prior to learning her name. Using close-ups, the camera compels the spectator to gaze at Cora’s physique. It establishes a way of observing that is seductive and linked to the perspective of the male protagonist. Concerning contemporary instances, the Transformers film series (2006–2014) shows women as appealing sex objects.
Filmmakers frequently attempt to avoid depicting female characters as merely sex objects by granting them intricate backgrounds, strong incentives, and an involved role in the storyline of their narrative. Nevertheless, the male gaze is still prevalent. Catwoman in The Dark Knight Rises (2012) possesses significant personal incentives, but she is still evidently there to be observed.
