Culture represents the entirety of societal norms, actions, and traditions that differentiate a specific community from the rest of the globe. Naturally, some societies share common characteristics, thereby creating cultural groupings. Meanwhile, leadership is a characteristic that surpasses international borders. This does not suggest that all individuals with authority behave similarly, as leaders are also impacted by societal traditions.
Differences in conduct are apparent in how individuals in distinct groupings perceive time. Middle Eastern societies are frequently compared to Western ones, especially American. Beehner asserts that while "most Middle Eastern countries are past-oriented" and uphold customs, "many Americans believe they can manage the future and welcome change for the sole reason of alteration" (72). Barak Obama serves as an illustration of a leader who rose to prominence by expressing the significance of change.
The array of distinctions in leadership conduct extends beyond the view of the future. Crede et al. have carried out a research study where they identify cultural variances concerning transformational leadership (23). The most notable discovery is that "transformational leadership shows stronger associations with subordinate performance in societies with low levels of gender egalitarianism principles" (Crede et al. 23). This indicates that the more conventional a society is, the more likely leaders are to succeed in transformational initiatives.
Overall, there is a clear impact of culture on leaders' actions. Hence, the meaning of culture should highlight its influence on leadership behaviors. Not only does culture differentiate a particular social unit, but it also emphasizes the possibility of transformations steered by individuals in power. Ultimately, these individuals are the ones who make the most crucial decisions in society.
