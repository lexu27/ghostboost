Organizational ethos is an organization's distinct traits that differentiate it from others in the sector. It is apparent in principles and norms, work morals, employees' consciousness of themselves and their position in the organization, communications, and human connections within the team and patients. The evolution of organizational ethos necessitates the delineation of the primary overarching objective of the organization - the mission, as well as the selection of a strategy for the execution of this mission. In agreement with Diversicare Healthcare Services (2021), their mission is to enhance every life we influence by offering exceptional healthcare and surpassing expectations. To attain its objectives, the organization provides a broad array of high-quality and cost-efficient services, enhances the composition of qualified personnel in medical centers, and executes cluster activities on a regional basis. Organizational ethos can both aid and impede the execution of strategic aims. Accurate comprehension and utilization by employees of the organization of objectives, values, and models of conduct within the confines of the existing organizational ethos enable an increase in the efficiency of utilizing the internal resources of a medical organization and a reduction in costs. Harrison (2020) asserts that organizational ethos can be effectively employed as a management tool with a good understanding of its capabilities and characteristics. Thus, founded on Diversicare's mission, its strategic priorities are to escalate the number of consumers to enhance their quality of life, expand services domestically and internationally, and optimize the operational efficiency of services. Strategic initiatives are interwoven with operational ones during an organization's operations, forging a complex management system. There are various blueprints for organizational strategies, and a company may adopt one of them or blend several as indicated in figure 19.6 (Hillestad and Berkowitz, 2018). For example, strategic initiatives are typically vital to ensure an organization's long-term performance in a competitive environment. Conversely, operational activities offer a framework for executing short-term plans and come down to making decisions under the specific conditions prevailing at the time. Additionally, these two initiatives have distinct goals: the operational one upholds the current position and stability, whereas the strategic management is for growth and change. Consequently, strategic management, in opposition to operational management, is devised to assure the endurance of the organization and the accomplishment of its objectives in the long run. The primary initial resource for the success of strategic initiatives is the personnel of the medical organization. The organization's staff establish organizational competencies and functional attributes and shape value attitudes. Harrison (2020) confirms that only individuals can spark ideas within an organization, irrespective of whether they are a regular employee or the organization's leader. According to Diversicare Healthcare Services (2021), the organization should have capable individuals in the pertinent roles, allowing for coherent structures. Therefore, the values of an organization are directly linked to its configuration. Diversicare Healthcare Services Inc. has numerous prospects. These encompass population growth and a potential rise in clients, reduced interest and tax rates, and enhanced quality of education, leading to a conceivable surge in the number of skilled labor. Diversicare Healthcare Services (2021) points out a surge in demand for elderly care services, which can also be highlighted as an opportunity. Additionally, Diversicare can broaden its operations to other nations, entering their markets. It is vital to continuously scrutinize the external environment with its intrinsic legislative, cultural, social, economic, and technological trends to anticipate these opportunities and changes in the process. Despite substantial opportunities for Diversicare, the company encounters potential hindrances. According to Diversicare Healthcare Services (2021), these comprise the incapacity to finance the vision and strategically handle their finances, the attrition of skilled and seasoned staff and committee members, the loss of government contracts, alterations in funding mechanisms, acquisition by a larger organization, and escalating needs and consumer expectations. Furthermore, one of these is the growing competition from national and international organizations, which can result in a loss of market share, consumers, and a decline in income. To surmount these obstacles for an organization, it is imperative to think strategically comprehensively. These strategic initiatives encompass formulating, executing, and supervising a strategic financial plan, devising a succession plan for the management committee and senior managers, refreshing recruitment and retention strategies, routinely reviewing the quality plan, and meeting or surpassing all contractual obligations. Furthermore, comprehending and monitoring the broader picture of the care industry, competitive forces, and emerging opportunities, ideas, and initiatives will harmonize with strategic goals and operations.
