The Bandung Meeting was the initial meeting between Asian and African nations that had achieved independence from the western colonies. President of Indonesia Suharto invited the leaders from developing nations to Bandung, resulting in a proclamation on anti-imperialism and peaceful coexistence. It was anticipated to unify emerging nations through cooperation in reducing their dependence on Europe and America.
The meeting aimed to encourage Afro-Asian economic cultural cooperation and oppose neocolonialism. The basic principles of the gathering were to honor territorial integrity and sovereignty, abstain from the use of power, have peaceful methods of resolving conflicts, and non-interference among the states. This nonaligned movement was established to prevent members from taking a position in Cold War politics, forming a strong opposition. The consequence of the Bandung meeting was that most of the Southeast Asian nations adhered to the agreement leading to the conclusion of the Cold War. Furthermore, the Afro-Asian nations obtained the chance to have a voice in global affairs, such as the representation of the Global South. The freedom to align with the USA and the USSR Bloc by the developing nations was accomplished through the Bandung Meeting (Lewis and Stolte, 2019). Although the movement aimed at dissuading members from engaging in the War politics of the superpowers, most of the South and Southeast Asian nations were drawn into the Cold War
In summary, the Afro-Asian conference, which represented twenty-nine nations from Africa, Asia, and the Middle East, denounced colonialism, racism, and the escalating Cold War between the Soviet Union and the United States. The agreement was crucial in shielding more nations from backing the war. The primary objective was political self-determination and mutual respect for sovereignty. This granted developing nations influence in future politics outside the Cold War.
