The medical care setting generally includes a variety of elements that result in nurses facing significant pressure. Particularly, nurses must handle very strict timetables, manage a vast amount of data, and cater to the requirements of a large number of patients. The necessity to offer continuous assistance to patients and ensure they receive emotional support has led to the creation of coping mechanisms that protect nurses from pressure to some degree. Learned positivity, which can be described as a deliberate effort to acknowledge negative thoughts and opt not to be overwhelmed by them is one such reaction.
Initially, learned positivity might appear as an artificial endeavor to avoid dealing with real-life worries. Nevertheless, upon closer examination, especially following the consideration of the difficulties nurses regularly encounter in the workplace, one has to acknowledge the necessity for a tool that enables nurses to sustain their resilience (Chang & Daly, 2015). In this context, learned positivity as the method of maintaining one's composure and retaining an optimistic perspective in environments involving high levels of pressure and stress is crucial for preserving mental and emotional health.
Therefore, as a coping mechanism for handling stress levels at work, learned positivity enables a nurse to steer clear of various complications linked to mental well-being. For instance, the utilization of learned positivity as a coping mechanism for stress management can avert the development of workplace exhaustion. Consequently, workplace exhaustion presently poses a significant risk for nurses due to the continual increase in patient numbers and workload intensity. Hence, employing learned positivity as a means of alleviating tension and lowering stress levels results in a reduction in the likelihood of exhaustion (Kahlert & Brand, 2017).
Lastly, it is necessary to highlight the favorable impacts that learned positivity has on the emotional health of nurses. Because of emotional depletion, working in the healthcare environment involves addressing devastation that could result in emotional detachment (Chang & Daly, 2015). This particular consequence is notably hazardous for nurses as providing emotional support and showing empathy towards patients' requirements is one of the aspects of a nurse's work performance and, therefore, one of the primary criteria to fulfill. Consequently, with the increase in workplace exhaustion levels, a nurse is improbable to fulfill the specified criterion, potentially leading to a decline in healthcare service quality and a subsequent reduction in treatment effectiveness for a patient. Therefore, it is crucial for a nurse to sustain a high level of emotional responsiveness and be able to empathize with patients and their requirements to establish a better connection with them.
Learned positivity has a substantial impact on nurses' well-being, primarily due to its effects on nurses' capability to function under considerable pressure, alongside the heightened influence of adverse elements that escalate the risk of workplace exhaustion. Additionally, continuous exposure to others' distress and the need to witness their suffering before providing suitable treatment is emotionally draining and frequently devastating. Consequently, strategies that enhance their mental well-being more efficiently, particularly those associated with meditation, contribute significantly to nurses' psychological and emotional well-being. Given that learning positivity as the coping approach that enables nurses to uphold their morale aids in averting the mentioned concerns, it should be acknowledged for the advantages it offers to nurses.
