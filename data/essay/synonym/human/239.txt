The administrative duty entrusted with developing a framework within the populace to reduce exposure to hazards and deal with disasters is recognized as emergency control. Routine training, drills, equipment assessment, and community collaboration in a crisis are vital components of emergency readiness (Oliver et al., 2015). Forest fires, quakes, cyclones, incidents, bombings, hazardous substances occurrences, blizzards, and inundations are just a few of the common disasters that fall under emergency control (Oliver et al., 2015). Reduction, preparedness, response, and rehabilitation are the four primary phases in the aforementioned structure (Oliver et al., 2015). Throughout the reduction phase, administration guarantees that prompt action is taken to address issues before a significant catastrophe (Oliver et al., 2015). This is a crucial step as it helps society in decreasing human as well as financial expenses.
To react to a crisis in the shortest time possible, the planning phase includes planning, managing, coordinating, training, equipping, regulating, assessing, and enhancing operations. Consequently, the response phase involves organizing all pertinent emergency services and preparing for initial responders (Oliver et al., 2015). It is essential to identify the necessary resources and how to deploy them effectively at this stage. The populace will strive to revitalize the affected area during the recovery period.
Emergency Control and its Advancement
A Congress Legislation was enacted to provide financial assistance to a municipality in New Hampshire after a wild fire had devastated the region. Hence, the legislation mentioned previously was ratified in 1803, marking the initial occasion the federal government intervened to support victims of a local catastrophe (Huang et al., 2021). In the 1930s, the government authorized Reconstruction Finance Corporation, as well as the Bureau of Public Roads, to provide emergency loans for the maintenance and restoration of specific community facilities (Huang et al., 2021). Around this time, Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) was established to produce hydroelectricity and, additionally, to mitigate flooding in the area. Congress passed a crucial piece of disaster control legislation during that period. The Army Corps of Engineers were granted more authority to design and construct all flood control projects in the United States by the relevant authorities (Huang et al., 2021). Consequently, the incidents above acted as a catalyst for other emergency control programs throughout the United States.
Distinction Between Emergency Control and Civil Defense
On one side, civil defense pertains to non-combatant initiatives taken to shield civilians from impending catastrophic situations and restore essential services and property in an attack. Civil defense, also referred to as civil protection, is an effort to safeguard non-combatants in a state against natural disasters. It employs disaster control principles such as prevention, reduction, readiness, response, evacuation procedures, and reintegration (Huang et al., 2021). A state's effort to safeguard its citizens (usually non-combatants) against natural disasters is known as disaster defense.
The aim of emergency control, on the flip side, is to protect individuals, assets, and governments from any dangers. For instance, as the threat of war and aerial bombing loomed, plans such as the above were contemplated as early as the 1920s, and several nations implemented them in the 1930s (Oliver et al., 2015). Once nuclear weapons were recognized as a threat, they became prevalent. Currently, civil defense has shifted its focus from military attacks to widespread disasters and crises after the end of the Cold War. Some of the terms used to describe the new concept include crisis management, disaster prevention, emergency readiness, recovery strategies, civil assistance, and public safety.
