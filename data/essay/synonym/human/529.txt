The association of the destiny of the protagonist with the advancement of community, which is the primary distinctive characteristic of the type of play, can adopt various artistic shapes. It can be a folk-historical play, bringing to the scene the wide masses of individuals provoked by societal disasters. At the same time, it is a play, in which the storyline is founded on a conflict that involves a relatively small group of characters (Boorman, 2021). Even with the briefest acquaintance with most of the developed Shakespearean plays, it is simple to perceive the focus of the playwright’s attention. These are the connections between the destiny of the persons and the progress of society. Shakespeare’s significant plays most frequently explore the theme of the demise of the finest individuals and their internal discord. Such is the play of Othello, where the author depicts the internal conflict of individuals whose reputation has been blemished.
In Shakespeare’s drama Othello, the primary characters slay their spouses to safeguard and restore their reputation. Throughout the drama, women must comply with their spouses to display genuine honor. Iago and Othello demonstrate this attitude toward their wives: they provide them with a cause to feel loyal by killing their women. Iago eliminates Emilia because she disgraces him by exposing his manipulation of Othello and Cassio. Othello throttles Desdemona due to the false unfaithfulness that his assistant Iago imposed on him. As can be comprehended from the drama, both characters have their perception of what honor is and how it is displayed. Nonetheless, both Othello and Iago eliminate intimate women to defend themselves, their reputation.
The only liberation for Othello from this uncertainty that relentlessly settled in his residence and his soul is the decision to which he arrives ‒ the assassination of Desdemona. Nevertheless, upon accomplishing it, Othello discovers that Desdemona is blameless, that both are victims of that monstrous plot that Iago weaved so skillfully. Othello labels himself an honest slayer:
“Why, anything:
An honorable assassin, if you will;
For naught, I did in hate, but all in honour.” (Shakespeare, 1975, 5.2.345)
These words are the key to the slaying he carried out: a man for whom honor is foremost, he could not coexist next to immorality and could not permit deceit to go unpunished. Realizing the horror of what he had done, he takes his own life – slices his throat with a dagger.
Trust in humanity is shattered – this emerges as the reason for Othello’s despondency and, simultaneously, the origin of his solitude. Because of this, an individual concludes that his entire former life and the attitude of those near to him were a mirage. It appears to Othello that nothing is enduring, honorable, ethical in the universe; all in a person is unsteady, chaotic, fleeting. Recognizing the principles of this world, Othello combats it in every feasible manner for the sake of the humanitarian ideal of a gorgeous, genuine, honorable individual. In the drama, the protagonist resorts to extreme measures to slay his spouse, who, in his viewpoint, disgraced him. It becomes a symbol and a message to an average person that one must strive for assurance in life and individuals. It is necessary to eradicate everything that can negatively impact the further progression of the individual. Simultaneously, in the final scene, Shakespeare reminds the common people not to lose their sanity in the battle for honor, regardless of how crucial it may appear.
The benefit of Shakespeare’s tragic ground is that he is still capable of displaying how this or that passion emerges from the abundance of a naive human consciousness under specific circumstances. At the same time, it is a regular human passion unlike the authors of a more developed bourgeois society (Carr, 2020). Therefore, the Renaissance depiction of Othello speaks much more directly to the emotion of every individual – both to the envious and the one who has never felt jealousy. The potential energy of normal, natural human nature in Othello transforms into the energy of emotion.
