In the large picture of things, prosecutors and victims of violent offenses are natural allies. The prosecutors strive to bring the wrongdoers to justice, whether to fulfill their obligation before the law or achieve career advancement. Simultaneously, the victims obtain moral gratification when the criminals are brought to justice. Therefore, one might assume that prosecutors and victims are naturally expected to collaborate. However, this rational scenario does not inevitably occur in practice. At times, the victims cannot adequately cooperate with the prosecutors due to the encountered shock, fear, or mistreatment in the prosecutor’s office. During the mid-70s, the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration financed the initial Victim/Witness Assistance Projects (VWAPs) to enhance cooperation between the prosecutors’ offices and victims (Karmen, 2019). Over time, the VWAPs have evolved into firmly established institutions tasked with the noble mission of supporting crime victims.
Prosecutor offices can aid the victims of violent offenses through various methods. The optimal practices encompass psychological aid in helplines and crisis counseling, shelter, food, transportation, and property recovery (Karmen, 2019). Moreover, most VWAPs provide referrals to local agencies, which furnish the victims with long-term care (Karmen, 2019). Additionally, prosecutor offices extend legal aid through brochures about the adjudication process. Lastly, VWAPs alleviate confusion by informing the victims about indictments, postponements, acquittals, convictions, and other potential developments in the case (Karmen, 2019). Consequently, the contemporary prosecutor offices are well equipped to ensure the victims’ cooperation through legal, psychological, and even financial support.
The San Diego County District Attorney’s Office functions as a specific illustration of a comprehensive victim services initiative. The Victim Assistance Program offers emergency (crisis intervention), legal (court support, orientation in the criminal justice system), and psychological (referral assistance) aid (San Diego County District Attorney, n.d.). Furthermore, victims of violent offenses may obtain special reimbursement for qualified losses from the Victim Compensation Board, which is financed by restitution fines (San Diego County District Attorney, n.d.). These reimbursements encompass such losses as medical expenses, home security enhancements, or outpatient mental therapy, among others. Overall, crime victims in the County of San Diego can depend on respectable support from their District Attorney’s office.
