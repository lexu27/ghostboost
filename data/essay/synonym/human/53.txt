Cryptocurrencies are a contentious subject in society, as their instability puts their long-term legitimacy into question. However, older blockchain coins have failed to provide a scalable and secure currency that will be as decentralized as possible (Hamilton, 2022). Unlike Bitcoin and Etherium, Solana has multiple advantages that render it a valuable investment. For this proposition, I would like to emphasize the advantages of this digital currency to a business university graduate. Solana is not the most recent cryptocurrency, yet it is one with the highest potential. Other blockchains possess a limited capacity for transactions, as their operations per second render them impractical (Locke, 2021). However, this currency transfers more quickly and has significantly low transaction fees (Farrington, 2021). An investment in Solana is a more secure option among cryptocurrencies, yet it has the potential to increase one’s savings. Safety and speed of transactions are the rationales behind the high probabilities for future widespread usage of Solana (Hamilton, 2022). My suggested concept is to take advantage of Solana’s recent success on the market, as this currency surged by 12000% in the past year (Locke, 2021). I believe that this subject merits more attention, as cryptocurrencies offer a unique perspective on financial interactions, yet their current status prevents companies from utilizing them efficiently. Solana has the potential to surmount these obstacles and evolve into a globally accepted currency. In conclusion, Solana is a digital currency that is worth one’s attention, as it has several advantages that make it a superior option for investment than other comparable coins. Its current stable position on the market and strong support from a cryptocurrency community is a perfect indication of future prospects. It might be necessary to evaluate Solana’s carbon footprint to demonstrate its potential for long-term success.
