There are multiple aspects that lie behind the successful execution of the P-O-L-C structure. It is vital to prioritize some of them appropriately if a business encounters severe problems, or when the market signals forthcoming challenges. The downfall of WorldCom in 2002, which triggered one of the largest accounting scandals in the US, offers a good illustration of the absence of proper communication within a corporation. The incapacity of different top executives and accountants to communicate effectively to prevent frauds is always catastrophic.
WorldCom expanded swiftly under Bernard Ebbers who seized the numerous opportunities that the increasing demand for telecom services offered at that time. Nonetheless, the company went insolvent in a few years. Furthermore, Ebbers confronted several accusations, including one allegation of conspiracy, one allegation of securities fraud, and seven allegations of submitting false statements with securities regulators. The reality that the significant portion of Ebberâ€™s wealth was in WorldCom stocks, not to mention several loans and loan guarantees from the company, was also examined.
The top executives of the company confronted numerous accusations and began to give evidence against one another. Additionally, Ebbers and his subordinates alike professed ignorance of the deceitful plots. According to Knecht (2020), up to 80% of workers generally feel that their viewpoints are disregarded. Hence, the primary element that resulted in the collapse of the telecom behemoth was the decreased standard of communication within the company.
The causes of all the misunderstanding and intricate series of discussions among Ebbers, directors, and accountants are entrenched in obstacles to communication that encompass motive distortion and excessive self-absorption. The top executives and experts who were supposed to guide the company tended to prioritize their own concerns and receive solely the segments of information and data that were convenient to them. Consequently, the environment fostered by such an approach ultimately led to the downfall of the corporation, due to the absence of properly organized teamwork.
