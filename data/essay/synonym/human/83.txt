The significance of education is to acquire fresh details about occurrences not previously familiar to me. Simultaneously, learning aids me in examining them and comprehending their adverse and favorable aspects. Consequently, since I have gained and absorbed particular information, I have the chance to put it into practice. If the background knowledge pertains to unfavorable situations, suppression, and bias, education empowers me to avert prior errors and foster an equitable future.

It is crucial to highlight that wisdom and encounters are invaluable, particularly if they pertain to issues that have emerged with relatives. Thus, the invited lecturer established his stance due to his mother’s confrontation with the discrimination of females. At the same time, the mother endeavored to reclaim her forfeited entitlements and standing in society at the highest and interstate echelon, which was not a conventional practice at that time. Despite the fact, there are numerous instances where women have sought assistance from the Supreme Court and the United Nations in acquiring rights that had not been legally reinstated. Consequently, Bill C-31 stemmed from such a battle and personally, for the speaker, signifies a chance for further ingenuity and settlement of Indigenous rights. Therefore, comprehending history and scrutinizing it inspires individuals to champion the reinstatement of their individual rights and concerns.

It is vital to be conscious of the historical account regarding illicit deeds aimed at native populations. Although, as per the data presented by Columbus, before the colonization of the indigenous populace by Europeans, they possessed a facilitated framework for entitlements and liberties and were resistant to prevalent illnesses. However, twenty-five years later, a majority of the populace had been annihilated and subjected to genocide.

In my viewpoint, even the documents issued by the Pope were designed to severely integrate the indigenous populace. Once again, even permitting children to be instructed in residential schools erased genetic remembrance and enforced fresh perceptions regarding ethnicity and history. Significantly, the government likewise enacted the Gradual Civilization Act of 1857 and the Indian Act of 1876. Whereas the former act assimilated the natives and compelled them to forsake their origins, the latter act effectively granted Canada the authority to dispose of lands and resources belonging to the Indigenous people.

It appears apparent that the Europeans were thereby asserting their dominance over the native population. The authorization bestowed upon the General Superintendent of Indian Affairs established remarkable command over Indian status. The repercussions of these statutes were defiance from the natives and a longing to reclaim acquired rights. Although initially, Aboriginal authorities peacefully implored the Canadian government to revoke the discriminatory laws. I believe that the implementation, the prohibitions on Indian self-identification, and the perpetuation of bias contributed to Aboriginal individuals' escalating sense of identity and determination to assert their rights.

Furthermore, given that this legislation significantly diminished the count of individuals with Indian status, they forfeited the privilege to stay on reserves. Consequently, I believe that the alteration of the land, the renaming of communities, and the alteration of Indian designations contributed to the fact that Aboriginal individuals desired their land and were unwilling to embrace the dominance of their territory by Europeans. The repercussions of such governmental actions are still perceptible today because the indigenous people have conveyed these narratives to the succeeding generation as a cautionary tale. I should also note the “Potlatch Law,” In 1884, the federal government proscribed this festivity and other ceremonies. The administration comprehended that these celebrations were crucial cultural and communal rites for the indigenous populace.

As a result of integration, they aimed to eradicate this element and offer clemency to those who would surrender their potlatch possessions, such as valuable masks, attire, and vessels. I believe the government intended to eliminate any avenue for Aboriginal identity and ultimately eradicate the transmission of verbal histories between generations and even sections of the tribe. Although, I consider that such a strategy did not come to fruition because the indigenous populace harbored a profound desire to reinstate violated rights and avert such a scenario in the future.

The repercussions of World War II contributed to the notion of human rights and citizens acknowledging Native people as the most disadvantaged in the nation. In my perspective, this transformation transpired because Aboriginal individuals also engaged in the war, which showcased their unity as a community, despite endeavors to eradicate them spanning several centuries. The outcome of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights led to revising the Indian Act in 1951. That is, indigenous people regained the rights previously revoked from them, they were allowed to vote, partake in rituals and festivities, and women were accorded non-discriminatory consideration. Consequently, it marked the commencement of a substantial battle against bias against Aboriginal women in society; it contributes to the fact that in the democratic realm, it is ultimately plausible to annul the Indian Act.
