Compulsive disorder (OCD) is a persistent and enduring disorder distinguished by uncontrollable, recurring thoughts and actions that an individual feels the necessity to repeat repeatedly. The scenario of Robert, a twenty-three-year-old young man, will be elaborated upon. Robert arrived at a mental health facility to receive treatment for anxiety, but it soon emerged that he instead grappled with OCD because he strongly emitted the scent of disinfectant and mentioned excessive cleaning behaviors. Following contact with surfaces and individuals, Robert felt a compelling urge to cleanse his hands with bleach. He could cleanse his hands up to thirty times a day, which severely harmed his skin. Nevertheless, the dread of germs was much more potent, and he could not tolerate touching something without washing his hands subsequently. The matter of cleanliness had a significant impact on his mental well-being. Amid the pandemic, the indications of OCD escalated considerably. Robert recounted wearing a HAZMAT suit outdoors, fearful of contracting the virus. In his social life, Robert evades making physical contact with individuals and favors maintaining his distance from them. He operates remotely from home, which rather delights him because he does not need to go anywhere and associate with other individuals in a confined area. In general, Robert does not rely on other individuals when it concerns managing his OCD and favors being by himself most of the time. In Robert’s situation, the blend of behavior therapy and pharmacological treatment is feasible. Cognitive-behavioral therapy can be applied to address Robert’s OCD, encompassing exposure and response prevention and cognitive restructuring (Moody, 2017). It is anticipated that Robert will experience alleviation from his indications within several weeks.
