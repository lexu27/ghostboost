The beginnings of bondage in the American territories and why it arose
From 1526 until 1776, intricate pressures influenced the formation of servitude in the United States, and historians have suggested numerous concepts to elucidate how the slave trade developed. Bondage was closely linked to labor demand in European colonies, especially in the Caribbean and South America’s labor-intensive sugar plantation industries of Great Britain, Spain, France, and the Dutch Republic. Slave vessels transported captives from Africa to the West, and indigenous peoples were subjugated in North American colonies on a smaller scale (OpenStax, 2019). Nevertheless, Indian enslavement effectively halted in the late eighteenth century.
How servitude was managed differently in each colonial territory of British North America
Enslaved individuals toiled in various sectors, including breweries, shipyards, plantations, and timber yards. In the areas north of Maryland, bondage would gradually transition to unpaid labor. The slave populace in the North steadily declined throughout the 1760s and 1770s with slaves in Philadelphia decreasing to around 700 in 1775 (OpenStax, 2019). Antislavery activism was widespread in the city, with nationalist writers distributing antislavery brochures to blacks and whites. The presence of antislavery factions facilitated the dissemination of emancipations, thus servitude became less feasible in the North. New York had a high proportion of slaves who acquired valuable trades such as masonry and goldsmithing working alongside artisan masters. All slaves in New York were liberated in 1827 (OpenStax, 2019) despite the liberation sentiment in the North during the Revolutionary clash.
The distinctions between bonded servants and slaves
Indentured service differed from enslavement in that it was a form of debt servitude where an agreed-upon period of unpaid labor often covered the servant’s expenses of immigration to America. Indentured laborers were not provided salaries, though they were sheltered, clothed, and nourished in most cases. Slaves were considered assets and were only granted freedom on rare occasions despite numerous years of arduous toil (Gabor, 2021). Slaves were traded, bartered, bargained for, and even utilized as assets in a will.
