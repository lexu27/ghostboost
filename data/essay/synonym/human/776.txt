The Account of the Business Idea
My business concept is a clothing store, Trophy Curves, for plus-size women. Currently, appearance plays a crucial role, and many women encounter issues concerning their body image. The garments that do not fit can prompt not only short-term dissatisfaction but also harm self-esteem and impact self-love for a prolonged period. Therefore, it is exceedingly crucial to encourage women and showcase their beauty with the aid of the appropriate high-quality garments at reasonable prices. My store is about individuals and individuals who wish to cease worrying about their daily attire selection. The clothes offer the chance not to exert much thought on the matter of choice between comfort and attractiveness since it merges both characteristics. I possess a user-friendly website with three to six days of US delivery that can meet the needs of even the most demanding clients.
It is viable to discover every garment there: from evening gowns to swimsuits. Consequently, it alleviates plus-size women from apparel-related issues in any season and presents a distinctive opportunity to relish life regardless of their size! The most significant competitive edge is the cost-effective price of the items. As the plus-size sector has undergone swift progress only lately, most competitors provide such items at the costs of the luxury or semi-luxury clothing segments. Consequently, numerous regular women cannot afford to purchase the garments explicitly tailored for them and are compelled to shop in mass-market stores. The primary message of my business is to demonstrate that every woman merits wearing beautiful clothes to accentuate all the benefits and conceal the imperfections. To fulfill this mission, the new collection prices in my store are within the range of 20-30 dollars, and the items on sale are even cheaper.
The Issue to Be Resolved
The scarcity of a broad range of garments for plus-size women due to the freshness of the social transformation in terms of tolerance of individuals of various shapes, sizes, etc. There are not many existing specialized stores, which to places the target audience at a disadvantage because of the supply shortages.
Competitive Advantage & Value Proposition
The high quality, complemented by the reasonable prices, is my competitive edge, as other stores of plus-size clothing offer items of identical quality for much higher prices. Moreover, the range of trendy items offered in my store is more extensive: from everyday appearances to special events. Value proposition – serving the distinctiveness of every woman regardless of the size.
The Justification of the Business Existence
To enrich the clothing sector of garments in general and guarantee the availability of a broad selection of fashionable items for plus-size women specifically.
The Operation of the Business
To bridge the gap between women of different sizes and place them in the same position concerning such an essential matter as the selection of clothes to wear daily. It implies equal quality, prices, and correspondence to current trends in mass-market and semi-luxury women’s clothing stores. My prolonged interest in fashion, complemented by my commitment to the body-positive movement, led to the formulation of the concept of a plus-size clothing store, which unites all women in their fashion enthusiasm.
The Area of the Business
With special attention to the COVID-19 pandemic, it appears logical for start-ups to be situated in the virtual environment, particularly at the onset.
The Date of Commencement
As spring nears, the demand for garments tends to rise – hence, now is the perfect time to initiate my business.
Interest in the business
I am fond of fashion, and during the recent fashion weeks, I observed the increasing trend for clothes aimed not only at ‘ideal’ models but at diverse women. I am a suitable match for this endeavor as I have experience designing clothes, including plus-size garments. My university study’s theoretical and practical groundwork equips me with the entrepreneurial skills and knowledge essential for the business launch. Furthermore, several individuals in my circle have instances of successful businesses and can impart their experiences to aid me in evading severe errors.
The Target Market and Niche Market
My target market is plus-size women in the USA. It is indeed a niche market as it encompasses a small market segment, so I am concentrating solely on the individually crafted clothes of 1x, 2x, or 3x sizes for females.
The Marketing Strategy
The marketing strategy encompasses the intensive involvement of social networks, particularly Instagram, as it seems to be the primary promotional platform nowadays due to the continuously growing number of users and influencers. Furthermore, as the body-positive and tolerance are trending, the demand for specialized clothing is even higher. I am contemplating the seasonal sales and promo codes for the initial purchase as well as referral codes of the influencers to attract new customers and build awareness. My marketing budget will be approximately 7% of my potential sales revenue.
The Defining Characteristics of the Brand
The defining characteristics of my brand are vibrancy (whereas minimalism is prevalent everywhere now), a restricted quantity of every item to ensure the uniqueness of the clients, and unique construction for a plus-size format that will spotlight the advantages of such a shape.
The Competition in the Industry
The women’s clothing sector, in general, is highly competitive: NAICS and SIC identify 94569 business establishments in the US. However, as my business engages in the niche market – specialized clothing for plus-size women, the saturation is lower, as only 8% of brands offer such options. The industry is currently in the growth phase as the rates of obesity in the US are steadily increasing. Between 2012 and 2019, the percentage of people in need of plus-size clothing transitioned from 19% to 42%.
The Revenue Stream
The primary revenue stream is sales, as my business is a clothing store. In addition, shipping is also levied (there is an option of free local pick up in St.Petersburg, Florida).
How Much It Will Cost to Commence This Business
My start-up expenses incorporate the materials and the manufacturer. As the store is online, I avoid the rent, etc. I have no staff, and there is no charge for a sales tax permit in Florida. The design and launch of the website and marketing are also on me. Therefore, the total costs of my start-up for the first line (100 items) of clothing are roughly 10$ per unit for manufacturing and 7$ per unit for materials on average, in sum 1700$.
How Much It Will Cost a Customer for the Products
The price of items ranges from 25$ to 45$ (without sales), plus shipping (if needed) – 9$.
How Much It Will Cost an Investor to Become a Partner
It will cost 500$ to become a partner (initially, after establishing the process and an accurate understanding of the turnover, the rate is likely to rise). Thus, a larger share of the business will remain mine as a founder of the start-up.
The Main Strength
Just try it out, and you’ll see the distinction! The new appearance in the plus-size industry is not as on the mass-market items of bigger size but as on individually designed trendy clothes that are on equal terms with the usual ones. Such a perspective enables women to relish their lives in every size and shape as there is no more disparity in quality and price.
