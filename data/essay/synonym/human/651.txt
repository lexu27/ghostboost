The 1929 stock market collapse was a failure of stock values that resulted in the most severe economic downturns in the United States. One of the reasons behind the occurrence was the speculation on the stock market. Entrepreneurs had profits on new technologies and could speculate surplus money, transforming the Stock Exchange from a securities market into a gaming-house (Schlesinger, 1957). In reaction to positive tariff news, stock values rose, and those who invested in the stock market became wealthy (Beaudreau, 2019). From October 23 through October 31, "a total of nearly 70.8 million shares were traded" (Klein, 2001, p. 325). Nevertheless, individuals took too many loans to speculate on stock values, resulting in a financial collapse. Other causes of the stock market collapse were low salaries, a struggling agricultural sector, and an excess of bank mortgages that could not be liquidated.
The Great Wall Street crash contributed to an enormous global financial collapse. Banks lost millions of dollars because depositors withdrew all their money simultaneously. Furthermore, banks foreclosed on personal loans and businesses, and those who depended on investment returns suffered the most. Individuals were compelled to repay their loans even when they had no funds. The Great Depression was another outcome of the stock market collapse, even though it was not the single cause. People lost their employment, and the most fortunate ones had their salaries reduced (The History Room, n.d.). Numerous individuals became homeless and unemployed, leading to the establishment of soup kitchens and bread lines. Several industries, including the automobile industry and building construction, declined because there were no purchasers. Some entrepreneurs took their own lives because their companies went bankrupt, and some of them passed away prematurely as a result of those tragic occurrences (The History Room, n.d.). Salaries were meager and working hours extended, causing individuals to suffer from malnutrition and fatigue.
