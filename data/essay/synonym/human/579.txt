Software infringement qualifies as any action leading to appropriating legally safeguarded software. The action's influence on the individual and community heightens productivity hazards through security vulnerabilities that induce users to encounter glitches and defects. The consequence of the encounter is irritations, wasted time, and lost labor (Parson, n.d.). Secondly, the lack of guarantees with the counterfeit software implies they are vulnerable to heightened security threats with the software harboring viruses and related malicious software that impact computers (Parson, n.d.). Thirdly, the individual or community is exposed to legal liabilities linked to unauthorized software usage when detected. Piracy brings about economic hazards that diminish lawful software transactions for the software enterprise. Law-abiding firms are compelled to illicitly distribute their efforts with others (Parson, n.d.). Moreover, with other firms outside the software sector willing to copy and save funds, software enterprises incur losses totaling billions of dollars annually.

In the U.S., customers seeking illicit material have a selection of widespread platforms allowing them to stream pirated content. As stated on Viaccess.orca, Stout (2021) indicates that 23 million out of 9 million American households utilized a pirated IPTV subscription in 2021. Furthermore, pirated video amenities' worth from accessed non-Pay-TV and Pay-TV consumers was estimated to exceed $67 billion by the conclusion of 2023 (Stout, 2021). To combat this type of piracy, among the most efficient methods is eliminating motivations for users to search for pirated material. The other anti-piracy resolutions are public relations and education, where piracy is emphasized as a violation, and legal and enforcement, where measures are executed to eliminate and disrupt pirated content (Stout, 2021). Notably, the other anti-piracy actions are collaboration, technology and operations, and barrier to entry.
