The traditions of the United States and Lithuania have been molded over numerous years, blending dialects, faith, dining practices, and much more. There are fewer migrants in Lithuania, thus, a greater variety of cultures can be discovered in the US. In the US, the English language is predominantly utilized for interaction, while Lithuanian is used in Lithuania. In both traditions, there are also numerous other distinctions that scholars observed when contrasting.
Americans are more candid, while Lithuanians tend to be reserved and unemotional. Americans uphold that courtesy and inventive responses are among the prevailing factors for effective communication, while in Lithuania it is less crucial (Jakucionyte, 2020). Principles in the US are frequently inherited from forebears to offspring and hinge on the faith the household follows. Some shared elements include selflessness and reciprocal support, along with the aspiration for achievement in the occupation (Smith et al., 2021). In Lithuania, the importance of the household as an essential component of life is conveyed.
