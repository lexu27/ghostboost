The dedication to health theory is a unique model crafted to identify the phases of growth and behavior modifications. This theory presumes the evolution of an internal condition, along with the embrace of the aspiration to promote a wholesome way of living despite any potential limitations a person may face. Additionally, through this theory, the required level is established, signifying a particular phase of human well-being (Kelly, 2014). Furthermore, this theory posits that there are no predetermined variances, like sex, ethnicity, and others, to foster conduct aimed at fostering a healthy lifestyle. In her study, Kelly (2008) applies the principles of the Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change. Primarily, this is executed to illustrate specific phases of the transformation process. Furthermore, the utilized model imposes distinct criteria for health. Therefore, the Dedication to Health Theory incorporates such principles as transformation stages, crucial equilibrium, and self-assurance (Prochaska & Velicer, 1997). Consequently, Kelly integrates fundamental principles of this theory; therefore, they are interconnected.
Regarding advanced nursing practice, this theory can function as an evaluation of certain patient metrics. Hence, this model will aid in defining the objectives essential for the patient to nurture the ambition to lead a healthy lifestyle. Practically, this theory will also support the monitoring of the transformation process and how to interact with the patient (Kelly, 2008). For instance, in the initial phase, the objective is to instill trust, as well as emphasize the significance of the required changes. In the subsequent phase, tactics are already employed to reinforce the patient's inclination to enhance overall health. The third phase is conclusive and should introduce the conduct patterns necessary for sustaining a wholesome lifestyle. Consequently, healthcare providers can employ transformation-specific strategies and motivational therapeutic communication methods by utilizing stages of change classifications and dedication evaluations to personalize therapy.
