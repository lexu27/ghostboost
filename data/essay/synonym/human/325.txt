Preamble
The United States has a past of bias and disparity toward African Americans. Even after President Abraham Lincoln prohibited enslavement and triumphed in the American Civil War in 1965, bias toward black individuals lingered in both the northern and southern cultural establishments of the United States (Jaffa 260). American subconscious prejudices persist over time and saturate organizational environments, social systems, individual neural processes, and inclinations of regular contact. The recent nationwide uprisings against police brutality have led to a significant change in dialogue and attitudes concerning America’s institutional racism. The killings of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Rashard Brooks, and Breonna Taylor, among others, have sparked demands for reform within the law enforcement and judicial system (Clark et al. 150). Many Black parents and Black-led organizations have pushed for these enhancements in communities throughout the country for generations. This essay examines some of the steps parents of color can take to achieve an end to racial bias and aggression in the United States.
Advocating for Systemic Equity
In America, bias is a financial, institutional, and social structure. That structure intentionally sidelines and isolates Black individuals while upholding and expanding evident and convincing advantages for white individuals, leading to increased prospects for employment, education, housing, and disparity within the criminal justice system. To initiate recovery and progress towards true social equity, racial minorities must face not only recent injustices but also wounds rooted in the nation's inception.
Since the founding of the nation, segregation has played a vital role in shaping the United States' educational, healthcare, property, employment systems, and nearly every other facet of society. Elizabeth educates Black children about the wrongs of racism in America's past throughout her story:
These stories acted as an instructive tool for young African-Americans about their physicality and vulnerability. The tales acted as introductions to fear and despair. The narratives laid the fertile groundwork for their anger. These stories educated children that anti-black bias and brutality were always nearby. They observed these transgressions numerous times up close and on their smartphones. (Elizabeth 307)
For example, parents of color have demonstrated the eradication of institutional bias along school and district lines in educational settings. For instance, in Brooklyn, New York, parents from diverse ethnicities united to eliminate gifted monitoring programs favoring standard courses (Smalls 362). Supporters should also advocate for measures that foster equal access to challenging and advanced curriculum for all children in their state governments and local education boards.
Joining Movements against Racist Aggression
Black Lives Matter has consistently prioritized human rights over civil liberties. BLM has advocated for a fundamental restructuring of society in which Black individuals are not subjected to intentional marginalization. However, the revolution's tangible impact on the legal landscape cannot be dismissed. Since 2013, these activists have collectively brought about significant change at local and national levels, including the removal of prominent corrupt officials (Clark et al. 150). In her work, The Trayvon Generation, Elizabeth recounts the racist aggression against George Floyd as follows:
I am once again unable to breathe. A knee applied his full weight on his neck for eight minutes and forty-six seconds. "I'm having difficulty breathing," followed by, "Mother!" George Floyd wept. "Mother… I'm finished!" George Floyd exclaimed. His mother had passed away two years earlier when he called out to her during his lynching. (Elizabeth 307)
In Chicago, groups such as BYP100 and Assata’s Daughters led to Anita Alvarez losing her re-election bid. She unexpectedly chose not to prosecute law enforcement officers linked to 68 fatal shootings (Clark et al. 152). The ongoing efforts of BLM protests against police misconduct contributed to the release of four groundbreaking US Department of Justice reports confirming widespread police misconduct in Baltimore, Chicago, Ferguson, and Cleveland (Clark et al. 159). Moreover, the broader societal significance of the revolution has been immeasurable.
Speaking out against Bias and Providing Support to Fellow Black Parents
Racism is ingrained in the financial, educational, and even commercial sectors. It permeates nearly every aspect of human interaction in societies, negatively affecting black individuals. For instance, African-Americans are underrepresented in leadership roles across commercial sectors, encounter obstacles to affordable housing, are disproportionately present in the criminal justice system, and their medical encounters differ significantly from those of white and non-black residents (Cain 156). Bias and disparity manifest in various forms, from overt exclusionary behaviors to the most covert policies.
Historically, voting regulations and proficiency exams were documented in the United States, which forced individuals to pay for their right to vote and disenfranchised those unable to read. This discriminatory practice disadvantaged residents of low-income neighborhoods. Thus, parents of color could empower black, indigenous, and people-of-color (BIPOC) to establish support networks to share their stories and brainstorm strategies to combat racism (Ali et al. 3). In the case of Darnella, who recorded George Floyd's murder, the incident must have been traumatizing, and thus, platforms like BICOP would assist her in recovering from the aftermath of the event (Elizabeth 310). Elizabeth describes the occurrence as dehumanizing and traumatic in her account:
Darnella Frazier, a 17-year-old Minneapolis young woman who witnessed George Floyd's killing in action on May 25th while on her routine trip to the corner store, filmed it on her smartphone and posted it on her Facebook page at 1:46 a.m. with the caption "They murdered him right in front of cup foods over the south on 38th and Chicago!! (Elizabeth 310)
Furthermore, by offering leadership opportunities to fellow Black community members, they will be providing fair chances for advancement.
Conclusion
In conclusion, ingrained biases in the United States have endured over time and now dominate corporate surroundings, institutional setups, individual neurological functions, and habits of routine interaction. Recent widespread protests against police brutality have brought about a substantial shift in the discourse and attitudes towards America's racial prejudice. The killings of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Rayshard Brooks, and Breonna Taylor, among others, have catalyzed demands for systemic reform within law enforcement agencies and legal proceedings.
Parents of color have eradicated racial disparity in educational environments by overcoming discrimination and racial animosity. For instance, in Brooklyn, New York, parents from diverse ethnic backgrounds united to abolish gifted surveillance programs favoring standard education. Additionally, by aligning with movements like the BLM, they have advocated for a fundamental restructuring of society in which Black individuals are not subjected to intentional marginalization. For example, BYP100 and Assata’s Daughters worked towards defeating Anita Alvarez's re-election bid in Chicago. Consequently, she surprised many by refusing to prosecute police officers involved in 68 fatal shootings. Nonetheless, the efforts of Black parents have had a tangible impact on the administrative and institutional frameworks and are indisputable.
