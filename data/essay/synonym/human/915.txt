I, Tituba is a narrative focusing on the struggles and unfairness of a wrongly accused black enslaved woman who endured cruelty and bias throughout her life. The narrative portrays the Salem witch trials through the eyes of Tituba, a black woman. Her life is marked by various injustices and misfortunes, resulting in her premature death. Condé introduces her audience by stating her intention to present Tituba’s perspective. This statement implies that Condé believed it was necessary to tell Tituba’s story of mistreatment to reveal the truth she was denied because of her race and gender. Her spouse, John Indian, a black enslaved person, experiences some mistreatment inflicted on Tituba despite his individual flaws. The novel I, Tituba, highlights the impacts of male dominance and racial prejudice on individuals of color and, particularly, on women. The story exposes John Indian’s cowardice and selfishness towards Tituba and further underscores her desperate efforts to cope with life's challenges.

In the seventeenth century, women were deprived of equal treatment compared to men. Racism resulted in the depiction of black women as inferior to their white counterparts. Condé included Tituba’s perspective to emphasize the male dominance enforced by men and its consequences on women of color. Tituba embodies a compassionate, strong woman who cannot harbor resentment towards her enemies. While black males faced racial oppression, their gender shielded them from the Salem witch trials. Notably, the white men of Salem, particularly Samuel Parris, wielded authority over the entire community.

Tituba’s life revolved around male supremacy, as illustrated by her conception through rape, false accusation, and execution. From the beginning of the novel, foreshadowing hints at a man’s control over a woman. The author employs this literary technique when he mentions, “Abena, my mother was violated on the deck of the Christ the King by an English sailor one day in the year 16**. I was conceived as a result of this act of violation” (Condé 3). The introductory chapter foreshadows Tituba’s brutal violation at the time of her accusation by four men. Her mother subsequently defends herself against another attempted violation, injuring the white male perpetrator, but she is later hanged. Her mother clearly advises her on precautions to take while forming relationships with men—Tituba’s downfall in the narrative stems from her involvement with men. As a black woman, Tituba is deprived of protection and respect in all circumstances she faces.

Men wielded significant influence over Tituba’s life. Condé’s argument underscores the role of gender and ethnicity in Tituba’s existence. Her life is shaped by the actions of the men around her. She is exploited and at times chooses certain paths due to the men she associates with. Her husband, John Indian, pressures her to admit to practicing witchcraft instead of supporting her in challenging the false accusations (Condé 5). The men in her life fail to view her as an equal individual due to her gender, as seen in John’s decision to sacrifice her to resolve the witchcraft case. Tituba’s selflessness contrasts with John Indian’s selfishness as she refrains from implicating other women allegedly involved in witchcraft. Consequently, Tituba faces sexual abuse and assault by four men, including Parris. Her resilient mindset helps her endure the hardships she faces over the years.

Femininity plays a crucial role throughout Tituba’s life. In reality, men dominated her world. Tituba eventually realizes that she cannot trust anyone, especially men. In prison, a fellow inmate named Hester shares remarks that deeply resonate with her, echoing throughout her life: “Life is too kind to men, regardless of their complexion.” Condé uses this precise language to highlight the injustices in Tituba’s and other black women’s lives. Black men have an advantage as they are only expected to work as laborers, while women of color are forced into labor while enduring sexual and social abuse.

Women's dependency on men is a recurring flaw in Tituba’s life. She defers to men, prioritizing their freedom over her own. Condé’s fictional depiction of Tituba incorporates biblical references to the guidance she received from deceased female relatives. The use of biblical imagery indirectly connects to biblical narratives. While individuals in the Bible are guided by God, Tituba is influenced by influential women in her life. Despite heeding their advice, she often chooses to follow the men in her life, leading to her demise. In the biblical context, Eve disobeys God by consuming the forbidden fruit. Similarly, Tituba disregards the advice of past women in her life, resulting in numerous calamities. “I was the last to be led to the gallows; surrounding me were strange trees laden with peculiar fruit.” Tituba dies realizing that her life has been shaped entirely by men.

In the 1600s, white men significantly impacted Tituba’s life. The dominance of white men in all aspects of life unjustly treated women without acknowledging or caring for them as individuals. The author’s argument suggests that men governed Tituba’s life from birth to adulthood. Condé states, “A white man had violated my mother. She was executed due to an encounter with a white man. My adoptive father committed suicide following an encounter with a white man.” Her skin color plays a pivotal role in the disparity between her and a white woman. Due to her dark complexion, life is more challenging for her, compelling her to live under male authority and control. In contrast, John Indian experiences a less harsh life, leading to his indifference in advocating for the less privileged, especially women.

While sexuality was a significant aspect of Tituba’s life, her skin color set her apart from other women in Salem. Being a black woman subjected her to intense scrutiny, not only from men but also from white women. “They were erasing me from the human grid. I was an amorphous entity. Invisible. More imperceptible than the invisible, who at the very minimum had abilities that everyone dreads.” The author’s argument underscores the racial and gender factors contributing to the injustices in Tituba’s life. Tituba is a product of white people’s imagination; she is exploited and forced to bear the consequences of others, such as John Indian’s cowardly choices.

Previous depictions of the Salem Witch Trials highlighted the unjust nature of accusations made predominantly by female witnesses. Condé sheds light on the truth about Salem’s black witch. Suffering seemed ceaseless for a black female slave in the 17th century. Tituba, the dark witch, utilizes her healing powers for good and refrains from using them for malevolent purposes. Despite her trials, Tituba maintains her composure and upholds her integrity, demonstrating her resolve to aid others despite her own struggles. The novel I, Tituba, brings to light the impacts of patriarchy and racism on individuals of color, particularly women. The work exposes John Indian’s cowardice and selfishness towards Tituba, vices magnified by patriarchy in an effort to dehumanize women. Tituba adopts a pragmatic approach to addressing the challenges in her life.
