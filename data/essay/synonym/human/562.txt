Service advertising is commonly defined as a promotion of an intangible product or a maintenance to a specific segment of the audience. It is distinguished from product advertising by such characteristics as Inseparability, Variation, Intangibility, and Perishability. This article will concentrate on the last characteristic, perishability, which suggests the impossibility of any storage or repeated use of the service. If the service is not utilized, it is most likely to be lost forever (Hole et al., 2018). Instances of such can be a concert or a sports occasion. At times they can be canceled either by a performing party or by a consumer. In this situation, the service does not occur at all. Perishability also highlights a limited time of their use, which is usually specified. For example, a concert of classical music that lasts for two hours. Due to these time constraints, the consumers can justifiably demand more from the services than from the products.
Another consequence of this characteristic from the advertising perspective is the challenges in regulation of supply and demand as it is quite unpredictable. Furthermore, in case of inadequate advertising, economic losses are assured. An instance could be not a fully booked plane or fifty percent of unsold tickets for a concert. Since the service still happens despite these facts, a portion of the income will be lost. Also, the services cannot be returned in case of a consumer’s discontent in comparison to other goods – it is also the feature of perishability. Therefore, it also results in a more discerning consumer as they cannot receive a refund and should be taken into account in an advertising strategy. In conclusion, to combat the issues caused by the perishability of the services, it is imperative to have proper planning, pricing, and flexibility.
