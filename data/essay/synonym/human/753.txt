Wealth disparity has long been considered one of the primary factors that significantly erode the quality of life. Furthermore, financial inequality, which enables a select few to become much wealthier at the expense of millions, is even more troubling. Meanwhile, individuals worldwide are determined to amass riches through entirely different methods, which can even be contentious. Thus, a thorough examination is necessary to fully grasp the significance of affluence and influence in the hierarchy of human principles when inequality levels are exceedingly high. High inequality levels reduce people’s drive to improve their living standards, as a lavish way of life becomes the main objective that nearly always remains a fantasy and is rife with debate.

Disparity can result in tangible hardships and reduced living conditions in many regions globally. Nonetheless, one of the infamous outcomes of extreme inequality is consistently the psychological understanding of the situation. When inequality is substantial and escalating swiftly, opulent lifestyles are challenging to disregard (Frank). Additionally, finances, in numerous instances, can easily be changed into authority in the US, as youngsters are educated to be achievement-oriented from primary education. Numerous relatively impoverished American residents can still manage many things that citizens of numerous other regions seldom even envision. Nevertheless, it is the inner feeling of unfairness and helplessness that intensifies the perception of low income for many.

In the 1920s, the swiftly growing significance of affluence prompted significant transformations in culture and the societal domain in general. For example, an entirely new literary category that focuses on the existence of the affluent became an immediate hit. One of the renowned novels that offer a suitable insight into the ambiance and the rapid alterations in societal norms during that era is The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald. The writer had direct encounters interacting with a broad spectrum of wealthy and influential individuals due to marrying a wealthy woman.

The celebrated author offers valuable perspectives into the numerous psychological problems that trouble the lives of the affluent and render wealth acquisition a contentious objective. F. Scott Fitzgerald asserts that the affluent “destroyed things and creatures and then withdrew back into their money or their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together and allowed other individuals to clean up the chaos they had created.” Moreover, the scenario of the protagonist clearly suggests that the original resolve to amass wealth is, in numerous instances, grounded in traumas and negligence.

The escalating disproportion in the allocation of affluence has various enduring repercussions. Parents’ riches play a crucial part in the accumulation of children’s human capital (Hubmer et al., 2). Consequently, millions of children are deprived of the opportunity to fully embrace meritocracy, which has long been viewed as one of the US foundations. The diminished emphasis on equal opportunities indicates a fundamental issue in contemporary American society. For instance, between 1978 and 2018, the portion of affluence owned by the top 0.1 percent surged from 7 percent to 18 percent (Saez and Zucman, 4). Hence, it is vital to identify the appropriate methods of redistributing wealth in a manner that guarantees the provision of top-notch healthcare services and education to all Americans.

Current inequality levels contribute to the development of an ambiance reminiscent of the 1920s. The majority of the populace begins to admire the lifestyle of the incredibly affluent instead of concentrating on the numerous avenues accessible for enhancing their lives. It is common for a society to have a few Gatsbys who are prepared to seize every opportunity to become wealthy. Nonetheless, a situation where millions of individuals believe they have forfeited all life chances due to the ceaseless extensive media coverage of the opulent lifestyles of entrepreneurs and celebrities is detrimental to any society. The American Dream has not always been perceived by the majority as accumulating extreme wealth. Initially, it revolved around a harmonious society, liberty, and the capacity to engage in any pursuits and ventures.
