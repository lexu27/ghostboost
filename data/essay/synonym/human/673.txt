As the Mongols widened their territory, not only did they become potent, but they also left a trail of suffering to those that opposed their rule. In the narrative of the Abbasid Empire and Section 7: The Emergence of the Mongols, one characteristic linked with the Mongols is that in their strategy and stopped at nothing to attain power. For instance, in the narrative of the Abbasid Empire, the Mongols utilized discussions and directives to compel the Muslims to yield to their rule. However, when the Muslims ignored the plea for military support against the Persians, Hulagu slaughtered the inhabitants in Baghdad and depopulated the city only to repopulate it decades later. In their ascent, Genghis Khan realized the Muslim states were formidable, like his grandson, Hulagu, who attempted to negotiate with Afghanistan and Turkestan instead of confronting them directly. Nevertheless, on denying the appeal, Genghis Khan attacked the Turkestan, annihilating every living being in his path. One distinction between the two reveals to us that in section 7 when Chinson Bayan invaded Southern China, Kublai Khan led the Mongols to permit the Southern China Empress to reside luxuriously inside an extravagant palace. When her spouse, the Song Emperor, learned how they treated his wife, he returned to China only to be captured and decapitated. Conversely, the invasion of the Abbasid Empire witnessed Hulagu lead his cavalry in singling out centers of learning for obliteration. The individuals were slaughtered in large numbers, Abbasid Caliph included. In contrast to Genghis Khan, who poured melted gold down the throat of the sultan, Hulagu instructed his men to wrap the caliph up in a rug and rode their horses over him.
