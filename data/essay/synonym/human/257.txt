Response is typically an evaluation or statement of viewpoint about the service rendered or the task accomplished. This form of communication is prevalent in both interactions between a staff member and a customer, and a staff member and an employer. The significance of such a tool is attributed to the fact that it aids in the prompt adjustment of the staff memberâ€™s actions to ensure optimal goal achievement. Furthermore, through the use of feedback, you can validate the correctness of the individual's actions. It should be noted that there exist both favorable and unfavorable forms of such a connection, which vary in their objectives. Therefore, if a favorable evaluation is designed to motivate the process carried out by a staff member, then an unfavorable one is employed to alter the direction of work. For instance, if a worker is informed that a task was completed successfully, they can proceed to the subsequent phase. In this case, it is evident that the staff member is heading in the correct path, indicating positive feedback. If a review points out the necessity to redo the work, as errors or deficiencies are highlighted, then such an evaluation is considered negative. It is essential to select the appropriate approach to give an evaluation, specifically, to maintain the proper hierarchical structure, professional tone, refrain from insults or jests. This will enable both criticism and commendation to be constructive so that it can be managed without incapacitating the worker. It is also advisable to receive feedback in a balanced, composed, and alert state to regulate reactions and sentiments. Typically, a staff member is unaware in advance of the type of feedback they will receive, and to avoid being caught off guard, readiness is imperative. Furthermore, it is frequently suitable to practice distant feedback to prevent interpersonal disputes. This is executed through corporate email or specialized platforms for submitting evaluations.
