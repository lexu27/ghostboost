Keeping tabs on student records can be a burdensome administrative task that must be eliminated as technology progresses. Among these innovations are database management systems that enable establishing an organized repository of student records, along with the students themselves, faculties, departments, and other crucial entities within the university. The distinct numbering of students can prevent confusion in cases of similar first or last names and facilitate transitions to other courses, maintaining the studentâ€™s primary identifier. Equally important is the capability to explore and acquire quantitative data control statistics for specified keys of both courses, faculties, groups, and students individually, as well as their performance. Now, requests will be accessible to all relevant staff members who may require this information: they will no longer need to submit appropriate requests to the archive and wait for a physical search.

The security concerns of this initiative should be highlighted, involving a potential data breach. This database should contain only information already in the public domain: no more than the given name and family name of each student. Intruders could exploit any additional personal details in a data breach. While this database could serve as a useful instrument for preserving all student details, it should be avoided for security reasons. This endeavor primarily aims for more efficient tracking of student assignments, safeguarded by copyright and should not be accessible through the initiative. The documents themselves should be stored in different secure locations within the university using the identification numbers employed in the database for effortless and swift retrieval. Explicitly limiting information in the initiative's entities will streamline the workload and accurately define the issue.
