Synonymous Summary
Bottega Veneta is a globally renowned label, but its performance may require enhancement due to the company’s recent expansion needs. Bottega’s alternatives encompass product variation and the creation of a new range of products. The label's identity must be revamped by highlighting the importance of excellence in everyday items and reducing the level of opulence linked with its merchandise. Bottega will be able to establish a fresh production line by shaping the brand image in a manner that connects it to the company’s core identity.
Preamble
The shift from a top-tier company to one that markets items for everyday utilization is nearly unattainable. Bottega Veneta, however, will assess if all facets of the corporate communication procedure are in sync (Weingerl and Javoršek, 2018). By assuring clients of comfort in their daily routines while adding a dash of luxury, Bottega will be able to forge an entirely new and highly lucrative brand.
Review of the Brand
Character Sketch and Evaluation of Competitors
Bottega Veneta brands are predominantly aimed at attracting feminine as well as masculine women, as evidenced by the images. The women depicted are intelligent and stylish, residing in the contemporary world, self-assured, and refined. Considering that Bottega’s women's fashion trends are largely irrelevant, the images portray women who have their own viewpoint and discern what is optimal and, more crucially, what attire suits them best. Indeed, these women value comfort above all else and are prepared to invest in high-end Bottega brand products. Bottega’s customers prioritize comfort over innovation, yet not neglecting the latter. Moreover, the target demographic is likely to lead fast-paced lives due to their affinity for digital technologies.

Evaluation of Digital Competitors (POPs and PODs)
PODs will encompass user comfort, as Gucci, Burberry, and Loewe all market opulence in a similar fashion as Bottega, but do not emphasize everyday items and their utility (Achim, 2019). Essentially, the products are distinguished by superior materials and timeless designs, setting them apart from competitors. Bottega’s majority of products are priced at a premium due to their exquisite brands and high-quality textiles (Zhang and Zhao, 2019). High quality and effectiveness are the primary POPs, which Bottega will need to thoroughly scrutinize to ensure that the standards set meet those employed by other enterprises in the sector.

Lineage and History of the Brand
Since 1966, Bottega Veneta has been acknowledged as a luxury goods and designer clothing enterprise. Hailing from Italy, the company has garnered substantial influence in the high-end design sector. By focusing on establishing the brand that will lay the groundwork for a fresh and distinct brand identity, one can effectively capture the luxury daily items market.
Brand Genetic Code
The brand genetic code will enable the enterprise to depict itself as innovative while concentrating on quality and consumer comfort. Consequently, the genetic code will be formulated with the aim of fostering a pleasurable existence. The brand’s mission will be to simplify everyday routines while infusing excitement and contentment. Integrity, customer care, responsibility, and exceptional quality will serve as the foundation for the brand genetic code’s expansion (see Fig. 2). The proposed methodology, based on the Onion Model, will aid in tracing the transition from the current brand to the forthcoming one.
Brand Persona
To expound upon the persona of the brand that will be crafted, the Aaker Model will be indispensable. By leveraging Aaker’s five persona traits, one can deduce that the brand to be formed is sincere, highly proficient, and quite sophisticated (Kakitek, 2018). Furthermore, the incorporation of luxurious elements may inject a hint of excitement. The severity of the products will be minimized to maintain their refinement (see Fig. 3).

Brand Recognition
The brand’s recognition will be forged using Kapferer’s approach. As illustrated in Figure 4, it is imperative to establish an intercultural link between the sender and receiver (Cuofano, n.d.). In Bottega's case, a feedback mechanism will be employed to establish a connection between the consumer and the company. The information gathered through surveys and questionnaires will be utilized to integrate culturally pertinent elements into brand goods and tailor them to the specific needs of individual customers.

Equity in a Brand
To enhance Bottega’s brand equity, especially with its new array of products, one must examine Keller’s Brand Equity Model (see Fig. 5). According to the approach, brand identity should revolve around how consumers and the company interact; commencing with the organization’s fundamental values and the perspective it brings to company-customer interactions. Hence, Bottega’s new range of products’ brand equity should be based on the utilization of high quality, innovative design to infuse moments of luxury into their customers’ daily lives.

Composition of the Brand
Bottega’s contemporary structure can be viewed as a branded residence, where all products are housed under the Bottega primary brand. However, when a new brand is introduced that incorporates daily elements; the necessity to reconsider the current branding strategy may arise. To reach their target audience, the enterprise will need to cultivate a house of brands.
Brand Leverage
Bottega will rely heavily on the strength of its current brand in the initial stages of promoting its new products. Consequently, the new brand must include traits of the existing one, including the name and potentially the typeface. Nonetheless, the company’s corporate ethos, valuing individualism and confidence, may be integrated into the design of the innovative product. Owing to their superior quality and final output, Bottega will endeavor to market their emerging brand as reliable.
Brand Positioning
While the current Bottega brand in the desired corporate setting is largely rooted in luxury, the successor must be grounded in practicality and presented as utilitarian in everyday life. Luxury components, such as distinctive architecture and materials utilized in the new products, will be provided as supplementary features, aiding in heightening brand visibility (Brunetti, Confente, and Kaufmann, 2019). Analogous to Bottega Veneta, the new brand should emphasize craftsmanship and everyday convenience, if not luxury.
Tactic for Branding
AIDA. To generate public interest in the brand, the AIDA model will be essential (Prathapan, et al., 2018). Bottega will strive to educate the community about its new venture, spark curiosity in the new everyday product brand, and motivate target consumers to purchase them. Advertisements and a website will be formulated, where promotions will underscore luxury and comfort to entice buyers with the aid of a customer loyalty program to drive engagement.
RACE. Additionally, the RACE (Reach, Act, Convert, Engage) Model must be employed to market the products and captivate the audience’s attention. Specifically, a new communication channel encompassing ICT and contemporary media will be devised to connect with consumers. To stimulate action (“Act”), the website will incorporate interactive components enabling customers
