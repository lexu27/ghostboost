The sorrowful and remorseful tone of the excerpt of O’Brien’s “Good Form” is established using precise word selections and stylistic techniques. The writer employed indifferent, direct words to portray the scenes and enable the reader to infer and empathize with the protagonist. For instance, the deceased young man was depicted as he appeared, slender and nearly delicate. In this extract, the author utilized repetition several times to underscore the significance of the visual that he perceives, such as “authentic bodies with genuine faces” and “faceless duty and faceless sorrow.”
Amy Tan penned “Fish Cheeks” regarding a memorable Christmas Eve gathering and a cultural clash. The protagonist of the excerpt is humiliated by her family and her own culture in front of visitors. Her shame is revealed through the choice of words used to detail the actions of her relatives, followed by the response of her guests and her own wish to vanish. For instance, the girl contrasts her relatives licking the tips of their chopsticks to her guests patiently awaiting the dish to be handed to them. Terms like plucked, poked, and belched are employed to illustrate her father’s actions, deeming them as repulsive and humiliating.
The excerpt of Yusef Komunyakaa’s “Facing It” delineates the visuals and reflections that cross the mind of a veteran gazing at the names on a memorial. Reading some of the names triggers horrifying scenes of those individuals perishing before the protagonist’s eyes. The rapid flashes occupy a single line of the poem, symbolizing how swiftly they emerge. For instance, by caressing the name of Andre Johnson, the veteran imparts a vision of the booby trap’s white flare to the reader, signifying the demise of his comrade. Consequently, the reader is capable of undergoing the same contemplations and visuals as the veteran, as though they endured the same atrocities and horrors of war.
