Regrettably, I have not been able to participate in any function or concert with a cultural dance presentation. Nonetheless, I recall vividly the television show, a segment of which was devoted to the indigenous people of New Zealand and their distinct culture. The occasion was recorded in New Zealand and was named the customary Poi dance; the exact date of the event is unknown to me, but I viewed the show in December 2021. It was not the initial occasion I witnessed cultural dance displays, but it was one of the most remarkable.

Poi dance is executed by large groups of Maori men and women who execute synchronized dance gestures. The motions are quite straightforward and mainly consist of stepping from one foot to the other and dynamic movements of the arms and hands. Furthermore, women frequently twirl around their axis and also walk consecutively in lines. Specific activities also involve engagement with special balls, rods, and sticks by each woman as supplementary items, as well as singing. The subject of this dance is the traditional culture of the Maori people, particularly the expression of joy and appreciation.

The primary movement concept in this dance is the engagement with various items such as balls, rods, and sticks. Each of the women initiates the dance with small fluffy balls, then progresses to brief white rods, and then they are substituted by sticks. The tempo is established throughout the dance by clapping and singing, and the interaction with these items is the focal point of the performance and dictates the movement. For instance, women actively shifted by stepping from foot to foot and moving their arms with balls in their hands, whereas with rods, they mostly sat in a circle. Furthermore, rods and sticks were utilized to establish the rhythm when they were struck on the ground or against each other.

The cultural importance of this dance rests in the conservation and display of the customs of the Maori people. In particular, through such collective dances, they demonstrate the identity of their people and engage with one another. I believe it was the unity and collective nature that impressed me the most. When I observed this dance, I was amazed by how effectively a group of individuals consisting of 30-40 people dances, sings, and interacts with items concurrently. I experienced joy and astonishment, alongside a feeling of admiration for this enjoyable and striking tradition.

The Maori utilized traditional attire, cosmetics, and continuous rhythmic singing to enhance the movements of the dance. It is notable that the music was performed solely by the singing of the dancers, which produced an incredible effect of genuineness and immersion. Additionally, all participants in the dance employed highly expressive facial expressions, which notably could be utilized to comprehend the theme of the song and the dance overall. Hence, it was more akin to a demonstration of songs, dances, and the utilization of various items that the Maori showcased. In addition to the aforementioned dance preceding the commencement of the event itself, men and women in the same traditional clothing carried out a customary war dance, which consisted of yelling and clapping. Formerly, various rituals customary to the local culture and holding spiritual significance were conducted. The occasion was followed by a feast with customary Maori cuisine. Largely fish dishes and local fruits were served, the names of which were not disclosed.

When I beheld this performance, I was overwhelmed with reverence and a feeling of camaraderie. I desired to replicate the movements and hum the melodies that the Maori sang. I do not believe I have ever been so moved by dance previously because the vitality of this presentation truly gave me goosebumps. This collective nature and harmony of the dance astonished me, and the artistry of the performers allowed me to immerse myself in the ambiance of Maori culture. This encounter was much more gratifying for me than I anticipated because I have never been a enthusiast of traditional dances. Nevertheless, this dance is a genuine presentation that captivates and astounds.
