It is typical for businesses to expand and develop in different ways, so there is a wide variety of ways that companies may progress. It usually relies on the management, industry, goals, and specific leadership perspective. These organizational forms have their own benefits, limitations, and obstacles. For instance, many firms encounter challenges while assigning work and then synchronizing diverse efforts after dividing responsibilities among groups of employees. The former process is known as specialization, and the latter is recognized as consolidation, and both play a crucial role in organizational structure.

To start with, specialization is a procedure of segregating a business into key elements like units or departments. This separation is particularly prevalent in major corporations because the larger a firm expands, the more difficult it becomes for a single leader to manage all its operations. Therefore, highly specialized companies grant independence to their departments and units, facilitating the organization of productive and efficient work in all elements. Notably, the corporate atmosphere and culture may differ significantly in various units, which at times introduces additional challenges. Amazon and Apple are illustrations of companies that effectively specialize their operations and have many different units.

Moreover, when firms implement specialization, they still need to efficiently execute their various tasks, which is why the process of consolidation is also important. Overall, consolidation is the precise coordination of specialized responsibilities and the work of all components. In other words, an organization that is highly consolidated can have numerous diverse departments that are still closely interconnected and lack much independence and autonomy. For example, McDonald’s is a tightly controlled company, and most crucial decisions are made by its small administrative group. Both consolidation and specialization are extremely crucial and should be fundamental structures in organizations to function effectively and outperform their rivals.

Regarding consolidation, it is crucial that firms choose carefully between the two available options. Overall, their decisions should be based on the company’s sector, level of specialization and its efficiency, qualifications of managers, and other vital factors. Organizations can synchronize group and individual efforts in two ways: vertically and horizontally. The former is stricter, while the latter is more relaxed, informal, flexible, and straightforward.

Vertical consolidation pertains to the system in which a firm’s higher levels use regulations and policy, authority, and control and planning methods to synchronize the work of the staff. For instance, authorized leaders must ensure that actions align with the goals and strategy of the firm. They make decisions, resolve problems and conflicts, assess performance, and reward or discipline employees. They also establish regulations, policies, and planning and control systems so that the staff understands the work conditions and adheres to the standardized procedures. As mentioned earlier, all operations and decisions of McDonald’s are managed by a small group of authorities, which is why it can be said that this company adopts the vertical form of coordination.

Furthermore, horizontal consolidation utilizes task forces, meetings, gatherings, coordinating roles, matrix structures, and networks to manage the efforts of the different units. Coordinating groups convene to negotiate and help align the efforts and tasks of various departments. Spontaneous informal meetings enable workers from different divisions to discuss certain issues. Additionally, task forces enable the collaboration of diverse specialists when a prompt solution to a problem is needed. The animation studio Pixar is an example of a company that incorporates lateral coordination and does so exceptionally effectively: the informal interaction among the employees and the three primary groups enables them to generate more ideas and resolve issues swiftly.
