In under two decades, Amazon has altered the way consumers perceive internet shopping. Prior to the introduction of Prime in 2005, two-day shipping was practically unheard of. Nevertheless, these days, millions of people are subscribers to this service. Initially, complimentary two-day shipping was Prime’s primary selling point. However, as Amazon grew, the commitment to free two-day shipping came with several restrictions. For instance, the corporation does not deliver small items, like blades or hair bands, individually. Instead, customers must buy $25 worth of products before Amazon dispatches those items. As for the customers, they are dissatisfied with such terms. Del Valle (2019) contends that the Prime service resembles a trick that provides shoppers with a false sense of security until they proceed to the checkout and notice a delivery date much later than anticipated. Consequently, this approach is advantageous for the company, as it lowers the delivery expenses.
To comprehend its intentions, it is crucial to discern Amazon’s warehousing. With the expansion of the pandemic, consumers have become more inclined to resort to online shopping. Waddell and Singh (2021) observe that between 2015 and 2019, Amazon inaugurated an average of around 75 new warehouses annually, spanning from extensive warehouses and fulfillment centers to more compact delivery stations. Subsequently, in 2020, Amazon unveiled nearly 300 new facilities, enabling users to truncate the waiting time for a product.
Apart from the quantitative facet, it is imperative to contemplate the qualitative aspect. According to Organized chaos: Behind the scenes of Amazon’s inventory management system, Amazon has devised a meticulously planned warehouse ecosystem that also expedites delivery. Consequently, goods received at the warehouse are arranged not by category, as is habitual in most systems, but by the presence of unoccupied space. For instance, an individual tube of toothpaste can be stored adjacent to an automobile battery. Bowersox (2019) asserts that firstly, it hastens the product placement process and the order-picking process. Secondly, such storage permits a judicious utilization of space in the warehouse. Additionally, automation is employed in warehouses, which also accelerates the process.
Consumer Reports conducted an inquiry into Amazon’s warehousing, from which the following deductions can be drawn. According to Waddell and Singh (2021), firstly, Amazon launches most of its warehouses in regions with relatively substantial populations of individuals of color. Nationally, 69% of Amazon warehouses have a greater concentration of people of color residing within a one-mile radius compared to the mean area in their urban localities. Second, 57% of Amazon’s warehouses are situated in regions with sizable numbers of low-income residents. Consequently, Amazon is erecting numerous warehouses in areas where land is inexpensive, which aids in saving funds, establishing more outlets, and catering to the demand of more consumers. Therefore, concerning the financial aspect of the matter, the company reaps substantial advantages.
Nonetheless, several other issues stem from such a warehouse management strategy. Waddell and Singh (2021) affirm that individuals of color and low-income residents endure the repercussions of Amazon warehouses. This is evident in heightened air pollution from trucks and vans, more hazardous streets for children, and other quality-of-life concerns such as traffic congestion and nearly incessant noise. Amazon is taking advantage of a national heritage of discriminatory policies that have segregated cities throughout the nation for generations and have disproportionately affected the well-being and environment of communities of color. Consequently, the vast warehouses that are emerging in numerous communities exacerbate existing problems, from noise to localized air pollution.
