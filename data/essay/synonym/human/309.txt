Introduction
The thorough examination of clinical cases is a crucial requirement for a healthcare system interested in enhancing the quality of life of the populace and improving public health. It should be acknowledged, however, that regarding the patient, their diagnosis is not always apparent, as it is frequently linked to subjective encounters of their own declining health, feelings of stigma, and any chance of inaccurate clinical examinations. It is accurate that laboratory examinations are a scientifically rational practice to refine the diagnosis as much as feasible, but the potential of human or instrumental error is never dismissed. Hence, a comprehensive strategy to elucidating the diagnosis, utilizing a synthesis of scientifically grounded and subjective facets of the disease's progression. This article consistently evaluates an illustration of such a thorough approach, depicting a case study of HIV infection.
Background Information
Though it is not a societal concern, particularly in light of COVID-19, humanity is subjected to numerous pandemics regularly. One of these pandemics is HIV, as a vast number of individuals are exposed to this ailment: according to statistical investigations, the quantity of HIV-positive patients will surpass 37.7 million globally by 2020 (UNAIDS, 2021). People from every continent are subjected to the ailment, granting it pandemic status. HIV itself is an infection triggered by the human immunodeficiency virus – during this ailment, a pathogen from the retroviruses class impacts the patient’s immune T and B lymphocytes, leading to reduced immunity. It is factual that HIV has never been the reason for an individual's demise, but alternatively, death arises due to critical immune suppression and the emergence of opportunistic diseases.
Purpose
The aim of this research is to ascertain a comprehensive approach to diagnosing HIV in a hypothetical patient.
Question
Can HIV infection in a suspected patient genuinely be identified comprehensively?
Hypotheses
 1. HIV infection can be identified by solely acquiring laboratory tests.
 2. The utilization of the comprehensive technique boosts the credibility of the diagnostic outcomes.
Procedure
Equipment Utilized
  * Medical history questionnaire.
  * Fast ELISA test kit.
  * PCR test kit.
  * Sanitary kit for physiological and clinical examination.
Procedures
 1. A hypothetical patient consults a general practitioner and discusses his or her concerns. The doctor (after signing informed consent and approval for medical services) poses a series of elucidating questions to narrow down diagnostic choices. The objective is to establish a potential (yet not precise) diagnosis and referral to subsequent diagnostic stages.
 2. The laboratory technician sterilizes the blood sample site, administers an injection, and extracts a few milliliters of blood for analysis. The puncture site is disinfected.
 3. The blood sample obtained in the second step is employed for PCR analysis. Additionally, the individual provides a semen sample for PCR examination.
Results
This laboratory investigation explores three varieties of HIV testing. The initial phase involves a patient questionnaire, an instance of which is depicted in Figure 1 below. It is an extensive questionnaire completed by a general practitioner to clarify the diagnosis. Moreover, the outcomes of the ELISA test are presented; Figure 2 demonstrates that the HIV diagnosis via ELISA is visually implemented with a control indicating the absence of HIV. Finally, Figure 3 exhibits the outcomes of the PCR examination for HIV and illustrates that the acquired value significantly exceeds the standard level.

Discussion
Support the Hypothesis
This laboratory study explored the feasibility of diagnosing HIV infection in a hypothetical patient. The diagnosis was explored using three variations of the test, a questionnaire, and discussion with the therapist, ELISA testing, and PCR analysis. A summary of these findings affirms both hypotheses, as indeed, HIV was identified using two distinct tests. In the preceding paper, the results of these three processes were provided; for two of them, it was demonstrated that HIV infection was diagnosed.
