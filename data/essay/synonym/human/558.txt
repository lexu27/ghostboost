Recently, the autonomous driving technologies have been greatly advanced by the researchers. Many firms view self-driving vehicles as the future of logistics growth. Generally, autonomous technologies can cut the costs on providing the goods. Such technologies offer more swift delivery opportunities. With the widespread adoption of such technologies, the entire transportation system will be altered. Despite the positive aspects of these innovations, autonomous vehicles raise specific ethical concerns.

Autonomous technologies can significantly enhance the progress of the transportation sector. The global supply data storage can be effectively transformed into AI-based vehicles. Consequently, the trucking sector and logistics will be more efficient and operationally focused. Thanks to these technologies, many costs for transportation will be diminished. This will be accomplished by phasing out the driver profession as autonomous technologies require almost no human labor. Another beneficial effect of autonomous technologies is improved customer services and faster delivery. Consequently, the overall revenue of various companies will increase. Transporting goods using autonomous vehicles also fosters more robustness in deliveries. Some researchers believe that the automation of logistics will promote deeper collaboration among firms (Kota, 2018). The expanded opportunities for collaboration will bolster partnership through expedited deliveries.

The most perilous negative impact of autonomous technologies is global job displacement. This is a crucial ethically and socially significant issue that should be tackled prior to deploying technologies. Presently, the driver is one of the most prevalent and rapidly growing professions. Individuals worldwide are employed in the transportation sectors to ensure the effective delivery of goods. However, with the introduction of autonomous technologies, all these individuals will lose their jobs. It is imperative to establish specialized training programs for drivers to transition to a new field.
