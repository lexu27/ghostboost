The impact of social networks is growing, moving traditional media to the second position. Specifically, the Twitter platform has evolved into a powerful tool for acquiring current information and even engaging in discussions on diverse subjects. Nonetheless, tweets can vary and might or might not affect society. This article scrutinizes the Australian politician Bill Shorten’s tweet regarding the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS). Although the politician narrates a happy incident in his post, he also voices remorse about the current policy, constraining the NDIS operations. This tweet aims to be both enlightening and lamentable. Concurrently, the writer reveals that the girl received aid due to NDIS financing but laments that this occurred solely after public awareness of the circumstance. Consequently, Shorten bemoans the present policy of the Australian government, resulting in the NDIS having a restricted ability to assist individuals. While his tweet conveys both adverse and favorable messages simultaneously, it can have a positive effect. Criticism from an influential politician can bring focus to the issue and urge society and the government to address it. Numerous indications suggest the impact of the analyzed tweet. As per Casero-Ripollés (2020), activity, prominence, and authority are the principal indicators of influence. This post garnered 209 reposts, 50 replies, and 858 likes – such engagement for a less-discussed subject demonstrates a rather substantial influence. Nonetheless, the prominence of the matter is low, and relative to the Australian population, these metrics are minor. Evaluating authority, one can argue that Shorten as a legislator is knowledgeable and troubled about the subject and possesses the expertise and understanding to articulate an authoritative viewpoint. Consequently, the tweet might be impactful in discussing the operations of NDIS but not on a nationwide level.
