The advent of new contagious illnesses such as the Ebola virus has consistently exerted pressure on the healthcare systems, leading to elevated mortality rates. This ailment is infectious, and its transmission relies on the interaction between the human host and an agent (CDC, 2021). This virus belongs to the filioviridae family and is accountable for dismantling the blood clotting cells and compromising the immune system upon infection. Ebola was a communicable epidemic that impacted various countries, including the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Sierra Leone, Gabon, and Italy (CDC, 2021). As a result, an elaborate discussion is presented on Ebola’s pathophysiology, its adverse effects on the community, and the remedial measures.

Evaluation of the Ebola Virus Disease
Ebola is a lethal illness that manifests symptoms like fever, body pains, diarrhea, external and internal hemorrhaging. The contagion can spread through direct interaction with body fluids such as saliva, sweat, and blood. The virus was discovered in the Ebola River in DRC after locals consumed the African fruit bat, identified as a reservoir for the virus (CDC, 2021). Given the contagious nature of the disease, it swiftly extended to other nations in that period, like England and subsequently to Cote D’Ivoire, Senegal, Mali, and Nigeria. This data suggests that this outbreak constituted a global pandemic that strained the healthcare system.

Several epidemiological and risk factors played a role in the dissemination of this virus. Among these factors was an absence of readiness to counter an emergency and public health knowledge concerning the optimal preventive measures. When Ebola struck the DRC, the country was underdeveloped and lacked the specialized equipment and infrastructure to contain the infection spread (CDC, 2021). For instance, the conventional prevention method such as holistic care was practiced, rendering the tracing process unfeasible. For example, during the initial outbreak of the virus, nurses at one of the hospitals named Yambuku mission hospital reused needles as the number of infected individuals continued to rise due to insufficient equipment to contain its spread (CDC, 2021). Furthermore, the treatment, management, and evidence-based interventions for ensuring safety were unknown.

Public health knowledge also posed a significant challenge as citizens were unaware of the transmission pathways and were excessively exposed to the transmitters. For instance, even after the mortality rate surged, people still engaged in hunting for wild meat for consumption and observed cultural ceremonies and rituals (CDC, 2021). This contact continued to expose them to the infection, leading to more fatalities and infections. Moreover, cultural customs such as burials exposed individuals to the virus since many bathed their deceased relatives by hand and dressed them for burial without wearing protective garments (CDC, 2021). International health organizations promptly discouraged such practices, but the new measures were not adhered to.

The transmission route of the Ebola virus disease was the African fruit bat, which carried the host, and when ingested, it caused the infection. Another mode of transmission was the carcass of a dead infected animal, which exposed individuals to the virus upon contact with secretions, body fluids, and organs (CDC, 2021). Humans also transmitted the disease through direct contact with the blood, saliva, and mucous membrane of infected persons.

The repercussions of this infection on the community were severe, as it compromised the social, economic, and psychological well-being of the people. When the infection rate spiraled out of control, many businesses shuttered, and inflation became the new normal. Additionally, most families struggled to sustain themselves, given that a large proportion of them lived below the poverty threshold (CDC, 2021). These factors contributed to a surge in hunting for game meat for survival, exacerbating the situation. Another factor was the stigma attached to survivors who returned to society post-recovery, as they faced isolation and discrimination for being perceived as transmitters.

This negative stereotype affected mental well-being as many individuals experienced depression due to being ostracized by the community. Furthermore, the spike in infection rates strained the healthcare system, with many healthcare workers grappling with burnout and apprehension for their well-being, considering that numerous hospital staff also contracted the virus (CDC, 2021). The aftermath of this infection resulted in long-lasting consequences before the country could recover from the adverse impact. Fortunately, specific interventions could aid in curbing the disease spread, including employing the Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR), enhancing public health literacy, and advocating for better health practices.

One effective reporting system is the IDSR, which empowers health departments and concerned individuals to report any outbreaks of infectious diseases. The system guarantees anonymity and is actively functional, signifying its accessibility to all. Other preventive strategies encompass public health literacy campaigns to educate locals on the transmission routes, symptoms, signs, and potential interventions to encourage seeking assistance at the early stages of infection (CDC, 2021). Additionally, promoting improved health practices like abstaining from consuming game meat, practicing regular hand hygiene, avoiding contact with infected individuals and places can aid in reducing future outbreaks (CDC, 2021). Governments should also invest in personal protective equipment to safeguard healthcare workers from infections during such pandemics. These measures will ensure that individuals are well-informed on basic safety practices to mitigate the spread during an outbreak.
