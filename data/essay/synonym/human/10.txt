The main origin for this research is the general medical periodical The Lancet. It releases the survey information and offers figures and a comparative examination of the gathered quantitative data. The Economist can be viewed as a second source that portrays research with reduced digital content. The research illustrates a decline in the HIV infection rate of girls in school by stabilizing their families’ financial challenges.
The World Bank sponsored the research to display the worth of money in lessening the dissemination of HIV among young, impoverished girls. The research was composed by Berk Özler, Lead Economist and Poverty Research Manager. The medical periodical The Lancet exhibited statistics founded on a survey in the Zomba district of Malawi (G.C. 2). The Economist later condensed the research with the most pivotal discoveries from the analysis.
Therefore, 1,300 unwed girls aged 13 to 22 participated in the research. This is an adequate number of subjects to analyze the prevalence of HIV in underprivileged regions. The sampling occurred with the aid of a computer, so the girls were allocated into distinct experimental groups randomly. Consequently, a group emerged in which girls and their families were provided with minor amounts of money each month, girls were compensated to attend school, and girls were abandoned without financial aid.
According to the research, it can be inferred that the subjects who received the money in both groups displayed a notable decrease in the transmission of the virus. However, test subjects lacking funds were compelled to seek a sugar daddy. Consequently, in this array of concerns, the statistics of the dissemination of HIV remained constant. Thus, the medication named money is adequate and influences the spread of STDs. The inference is that the global community necessitates financing to halt the distribution of HIV. Nonetheless, investigation and additional support to young girls have various constraints. Initially, it is challenging to ascertain how much money each individual requires to cease seeking sugar daddies and proceed with their lives. Furthermore, the research was executed over 18 months, thus it is impracticable to evaluate how it will function in the long run.
