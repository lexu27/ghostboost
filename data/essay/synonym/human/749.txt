Introduction
The piece for visual examination was crafted by Cindy Sherman, and the photograph is from one of the collections dedicated to the portrayal of female movie characters. Its choice was based on the informativeness of the image regarding the uncertainty of black-and-white portraits in general, as well as the potential to uncover the cause behind this phenomenon (Public Delivery, 2021). This reasoning is backed by the fact that the captivating force of the image is ensured by the contemplation about the individuals and their lives it conjures. Thus, the reason why it is deserving of analysis is the chance to explore the cultural aspects of cinema by concentrating on a single picture about the gaze (“COMS3410 week three,” n.d.).
The image utilized for this goal is recognized as “Untitled Film Still #21,” created in 1978, using gelatin silver print, and it is presently accessible in the online collection of MoMA Learning (Sherman, n.d.). Therefore, the scrutiny of this piece is plausible from the perspective of demonstrating the significance of the sociological basis of cultural products and the way visual techniques are employed for transmitting the message.
Visual Description
The black-and-white picture seems quite simplistic at first glance; nevertheless, a closer examination confirms the presence of a more intricate motivation of its creator. Initially, a viewer focuses on the woman, gazing to the left with a sorrowful expression on her face (Sherman, n.d.). This attribute, which is avoiding the camera, is one of the primary characteristics of Sherman’s collection as a whole, and it is evident in the image (Public Delivery, 2021). In the backdrop, there are several structures, and the setting, likely a city center, appears deliberate (see Appendix A). It conveys about countless other individuals, resembling the depicted woman, who face similar challenges. Although it is uncertain what kind of difficulty it might be without alluding to the past, one can readily infer that it is linked to the status of female citizens in society (Public Delivery, 2021). Hence, the chosen piece is enlightening from the viewpoint of historical trends as well as their typical depiction.
The described visual attributes and specifics of the photograph are complemented by the technical aspect, compositional solutions, and social practices, which play a substantial role in comprehending the examined work. According to Gillian Rose’s framework, technology is crucial for analysis, and, in this scenario, it is presented by the simplicity of technique, intentionally accentuated to mirror the spirit of the age (“COMS3410 week two,” n.d.; Sherman, n.d.). In turn, the selection of colors supports this viewpoint, and the spatial arrangement and, more specifically, the distance between the woman and the buildings, validates the alleged lack of understanding between her and the world. The societal component of this work is depicted by the relationships between individuals based on gender bias and, consequently, isolation of the individual (Public Delivery, 2021). Here, “the separation between her and the audience” is complemented by “the shine of sweat, humidity, and fear,” thereby indicating the existence of global issues (Public Delivery, 2021). In this manner, the selected piece can be characterized by a simple medium in combination with the complexity of issues typical for the female population of the previous century.
Compositional Analysis
Compositional Modality
In the evaluation of the image, compositional modality is one of the most crucial parameters that should be considered to uphold the significance of its parts for the entire message. Thus, as per Rose’s framework, the genre is pivotal, and in this instance, it is black-and-white photography as a means of showcasing the situations in the past (“COMS3410 week two,” n.d.; Sherman, n.d.). It is more appropriate for this purpose since relying on modern techniques would be detrimental to the overall perception of the piece by the audience (“COMS3410 week 4,” n.d.). Meanwhile, the composition remains relatively stable regarding remaining unchanged when examining it closer and serving as confirmation of a prejudiced attitude toward women’s portrayal (Public Delivery, 2021). The sole viewing position offered to individuals is that of an outsider, and it underlines the societal issues alluded to by the creator.
Overall, the composition and its specifics serve as confirmation of proper organization and elimination of distractions while revealing the photographer’s concerns. In this instance, the image as it is currently presented can convey the general challenge of the perception of the female population as attractive regardless of personal circumstances (Public Delivery, 2021). This approach was prevalent in the twentieth century, and the fact that it is utilized in this picture affirms its historical accuracy (Sherman, n.d.). Furthermore, the possibility of siting it in a different context is improbable to alter the message unless other details are incorporated.
Gaze and Tishman’s Approach: Significance for Interpretation
Another factor that should be taken into consideration in the present analysis is the significance of the male gaze for interpreting the image. The focus on this perspective is contingent on the fact that Hollywood movies are frequently viewed through this lens, and female characters are portrayed as “highly sexualized objects of male desire” (“COMS3410 week three,” n.d.). The woman in the picture resembles other photographs in the genre and, thus, can be perceived as belonging to this category (Sherman, n.d.). This perspective is substantiated by other works in the collection as the mentioned feature is attributed to all of them (Public Delivery, 2021). The connection between the identity of individuals and their femininity is proven by the attention to makeup as a means for asserting one’s place in the world (Public Delivery, 2021). Thus, the scrutinized picture wholly corresponds to the described standards while being intended for depicting them in the right light or, in other words, criticizing societal trends of the past.
Moreover, the specifics of the piece contribute to the overall perception of this work as one belonging to the past. As per Tishman’s framework, the colors, lines, and shapes, which are crucial for observation, are arranged in such a way that a viewer has no doubts regarding the historical focus of the creator (“COMS3410 week two,” n.d.). The black-and-white objects and simple and clear contours are, therefore, crucial for interpretation, while the distance between the woman and the world behind her conveys the general message of isolation (“COMS3410 week two,” n.d.). Additionally, the contrast between these two parts of the photographs reminds the audience of this fact while also being vital for supporting the importance of characteristics discussed in previous sections.
Connection to Visual Themes and Larger Ideas
The composition of “Untitled Film Still #21,” examined above, is explicitly linked to larger ideas, which are visually portrayed by the photographer. Thus, the connection is seen in the correlation between the woman’s face in the foreground and the importance of makeup for asserting a position in society (Public Delivery, n.d.). In other words, the sociological motives incorporated in the art become apparent after observing this picture (“COMS3410 week 5,” n.d.). The image also conveys the alleged public crisis concerned with “conventional rules of how women or people, for that matter, should behave” (Public Delivery, n.d.; “COMS3410 week 6,” n.d.). From
