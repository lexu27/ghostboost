The exceedingly detrimental impact that imperialism has inflicted on native populations who have endured subjugation and the arrival of Caucasian settlers cannot conceivably be welcomed. In Chinua Achebe’s “Things Fall Apart,” the disintegration of the local community as a direct consequence of the imperialist authority is presented freely and forcefully. By imposing their convictions, principles, outlooks, and other aspects of the white culture on local inhabitants, colonizers have nearly obliterated the Ibo culture, leading to its members enduring significant cultural trauma.
Indeed, the essence of the colonizers’ sway over the Ibo people and their culture is highlighted in the very title of the novel. By evoking a mental picture of the entire setting crumbling and eventually collapsing, the author illustrates the ruinous nature of the imperialist authority. Specifically, the societal divide resulting from the “partition of Africa into at least fifty nation-states” is depicted powerfully in Achebe’s creation (“Things Fall Apart”). Furthermore, being compelled to educate their offspring on the fundamental principles of the alien culture, the Ibo people cultivate a feeling of cultural deprivation and, ultimately, extensive community trauma (“Things Fall Apart: Plot Summary”). Hence, the anguish that the Ibo people undergo as they sense the catastrophic loss of their culture is especially poignant in the novel.
By regarding the Caucasian, western culture as the sole logical and valid mindset to adopt, Caucasian settlers have nearly decimated the Ibo culture, as Achebe’s “Things Fall Apart” demonstrates. The novel illustrates how the colonizers imposed their culture on the Ibo people, compelling its members not only to embrace the new principles, philosophies, and even religion, but also to instill the specified cultural norms in their offspring. Consequently, deprived of their culture and identity, the Ibo community commenced disintegrating, as the novel vividly narrates.
