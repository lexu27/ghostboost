A tort alludes to neglect or deed that leads to harm/injury to another individual and constitutes a wrongdoing where a person who was harmed may obtain damages (US Legal Inc., n.d.). In this instance, the tort that Tom suffered was being struck by a baseball that rendered him unconscious. He was subsequently transported to the hospital due to the impact. Another tort was the reality that he misplaced his belongings when another spectator pilfered his cellphone and wallet. Lastly, the final tort is food poisoning, but only if Tom can substantiate that it is due to the food poisoning that he had to remain home for two weeks without working.
For the initial harm the stadium is accountable because we are not informed that they have a disclaimer on the tickets that absolve the management from such injuries caused by flying balls (All Law, 2015). Secondly, the theft of his mobile phone and wallet cannot be connected with the stadium, hence, the stadium is not accountable for the theft of his possessions, and the individual who stole is responsible. Finally, if Tom can validate that he remained home for two weeks because of food poisoning, then, the stadium is accountable. Nonetheless, in the event of the concussion liability will not lie with the stadium.
Lastly, concerning Tomâ€™s situation with food poisoning, it does not matter if he obtained a ticket or not. By him purchasing a beer and a hot dog directly from the vendor, he legally acquired it from the stadium and the transaction was separate from the ticket. However, any other occurrence such as an incident or illness as a consequence of purchases should be lawfully valid and the stadium still accountable.
