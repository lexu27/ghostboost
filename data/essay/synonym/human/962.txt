Digital forensic tools are vastly popular among digital examiners, as they enable easy execution of the essential technical analyses. One of the most renowned software applications for digital forensics is Autopsy, a kit that scrutinizes the images existing on a device’s hard disk. Competent in interacting with personal computers and smartphones, Autopsy is exceedingly adaptable and encompasses numerous features for thoroughly scrutinizing the image files existing on the storage unit ( Autopsy , n.d.). Specifically, Autopsy permits viewing visual data stored on the device, exploring the repository for specific items, or extracting the data ( Autopsy , n.d.). Despite this software being distributed freely, it remains an exceptional tool for forensic examination and is consistently updated to keep pace with technological advancements.
Some digital forensics software is exceptionally precise, devised to examine a particular system. Consequently, Arsenal Recon is a tool formulated to explore the Windows operating system and its registry, thereby accessing information about the device’s configuration specifics. Given that a Windows registry accommodates an extensive amount of information about the applications installed and data processed, Arsenal Recon can be exceedingly valuable when carrying out a digital forensic investigation ( Arsenal Recon , n.d.). Nonetheless, this software is commercially produced, it is not available free of charge, and $65 monthly or $756 annually must be paid to acquire access.
Lastly, distinct programs are essential when operating with a smartphone system. Cellebrite UFED is one of the techniques utilized to recover data from various kinds of mobile devices, predominantly contemporary smartphones that have unique operating systems ( Cellebrite UFED , n.d.). In view of this proof, Cellebrite UFED possesses an array of functions to bypass the phone’s security measures, and retrieve the information stored in the internal storage or on external cards ( Cellebrite UFED , n.d.). Nonetheless, the software can solely be bought for specific intents, with prices commencing at $2499.
