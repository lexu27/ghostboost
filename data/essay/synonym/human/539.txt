The article "What's fresh in the Caribbean for 2022" penned by Suri (2020) illustrates the rejuvenation of the Caribbean islands post the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, the writer notes that the infrastructure in the area is undergoing significant refurbishments and progressions to entice a larger number of tourists once the situation stabilizes. In 2020, the Caribbean tourism sector faced a distressing decline, but in 2021, a notable portion of international travelers selected the region as their destination. The author specifies that Americans are not an exemption; the reasons being the proximity of the islands and their relatively effective campaign against the pandemic. To delve further into the scenario regarding the tourism advancements of the Caribbean, Suri presents specific data. According to the author, many visitors, predominantly individuals from the U.S., were compelled to visit the Caribbean as a pandemic travel spot due to its accessibility and fairly successful reputation in handling Covid-19 (Suri, 2021). Although inbound visitations were severely affected in 2020, the number of foreign tourists in 2021 was considerably larger, at least for a choice of islands (Suri, 2021). 14 of the 26 Caribbean Tourism Organization participating nations documented a significant surge in international travelers in 2021. Contemplating the aforementioned, the region aims to convert new visitors into regulars to combat the quarantine-related economic slump promptly. This necessitates a maximal refurbishment of the resorts to ensure they stay adequately competitive. Hence, the most favored and influential islands are investing remarkably large amounts in their development. This entails not only constructing and refurbishing tourist spots like hotels or beaches, but also vital enhancements in other domains. Among these is energy, where the Caribbean islands strive to achieve complete self-sufficiency, transportation, the provision of drinkable water, and others. To fulfill its objective, the region must significantly enhance its capacity, signifying the capability to accommodate more individuals than currently feasible. This entails additional residences, air seats, and attractions to captivate the guests. Furthermore, the existing visa regulations necessitate reassessment to permit visitors to enjoy extended vacations in the region devoid of concerns about bureaucratic matters. Furthermore, certain islands are contemplating allowing foreigners to work without any specific paperwork, which might contribute to their eagerness to reside in the region. Certain communities are devising innovative solutions to draw in as many individuals as possible, one of which is a voyage to Bermuda with no ties to other islands. To present factual details and shed light on ongoing alterations, Suri cites instances of developers like John Alexander. He plans to construct more lodgings and will unveil the region's premiere glamping site, Little Bay Eco Resort, on 54 acres, with tented rooms akin to another lavish glamping retreat, Paws Up Montana (Suri, 2021). Another instance is illustrated through St. Lucia's approach, in 2021 gained 20,000 additional flight seats from the U.S., and the creation of new amenities was already in progress (Suri, 2021). According to the island's leader, Evelyn Wever-Croes, Aruba's quantity of tourists began to rebound in July 2021 (Suri, 2021). The region now plans to allocate around $153 million in 2022 and $264 million in 2023 to enhance accommodations.
