The “Eye of the Storm” clip is an intriguing instance of how ethnicity can be socially built in the school environment. Jane Elliott established a differentiation between blue-eyed and brown-eyed kids, instructing the youthful participants that their peers with brown eyes were superior (Bloom). Even though this comparison lacks any intrinsic significance and is simply an illustration of one’s level of melanin in the body, it became meaningful for the kids. Consequently, Elliott socially constructed ethnicity by proposing that one set of kids is superior to the other, with the eye colors acting as symbols to highlight ethnicity and group affiliation.
Due to such differentiation, variations in the students’ actions and performance became noticeable. Elliott noted that the kids in the brown-eyed category became more self-assured, and they started to act more condescendingly toward their blue-eyed classmates. Conversely, the latter students have been documented to become more reserved and meek, ostensibly daunted by the pressure from the opposite group (Bloom). Blue-eyed kids felt less secure, with their academic achievement decreasing significantly and their interactions with their former brown-eyed peers deteriorating (Bloom). By the culmination of the exercise, a significant contrast between the two groups was strikingly apparent, and altercations among the learners could be observed frequently. Consequently, each group was adversely affected by the innovative racial social framework.
What struck me the most in this experiment was how rapidly the alterations in the children’s behavior became visible. Although the classmates seemed to have tight bonds before the differentiation was established, these ties were suddenly severed after Elliott formed the two factions. The fresh behavioral trends emerged very swiftly, demonstrating how effortlessly kids can assimilate the new regulations into their everyday routines. From this viewpoint, educators and grown-ups should be exceedingly cautious when instructing children on various subjects, as the consequences of such education can be catastrophic.
