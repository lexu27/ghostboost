Authority might corrupt those who wield it, and the quest for dominance is often detrimental. Individuals whose life goal is to acquire authority over others are doomed to fail since human ambition frequently leads to sinful behaviors, which are inevitably penalized. While The administration is the structure that formulates laws and guarantees that they are obeyed, it is the individual who wields authority who is responsible for the fairness and impartiality of its implementation.
Catastrophes are at the core of Shakespeare’s innovative inheritance. They embody the vigor of his brilliant intellect as well as the core of his era, which is the reason why, if following periods sought to Shakespeare for analogy, they first comprehended their struggles through him. Shakespeare’s tragedies have been impacted by a growing array of new interpretations. Macbeth, one of Shakespeare’s most famous tragedies, portrays characters who have been harmed by their ambition and exposes the destructive nature of the longing for authority for the sake of power. Shakespeare’s Macbeth is the most detailed depiction of the individualist as a person who actively and consistently prioritizes what mirrors her concerns over the concerns of others. Macbeth, impelled by ambition, is eager to free his mind from ethical principles and domestic norms, viewing them as obstacles and meaningless preconceptions.
Individuals, like the drama’s primary protagonists, who are consumed by the notion of seizing the throne, are frequently tainted by authority and ultimately ruin their own lives and the lives of others. Macbeth is a tragedy of overpowering ambition; hence, it’s no shock that its recurring theme is the protagonist’s words: “I dare everything a man dares,” which are directed to death itself in the end: “I desire to experience the last.” Macbeth is a tragedy about a colossal personality who had the same opportunities for triumph as death, but courage without wisdom impelled it to complete isolation from humanity and its essence.
Macbeth is willing to slay and deceive even intimate acquaintances to gain the crown and the realm. With a dagger, the hero murders the slumbering monarch. He also commands the Banquo and Macduff families to be executed. Macbeth does not perceive individuals; instead, he perceives obstacles on his path to the throne. Upon realizing that he might inherit the throne, Macbeth, a brave and potent warrior and devoted servant of the king, metamorphoses into a covetous and brutal assassin.
Lady Macbeth seems to be a more ambitious woman than her spouse Macbeth., so Macbeth is far from the only individual whose life has been tainted by authority. This woman convinces her spouse that Duncan should be assassinated if he visits their abode. “Look like an innocent flower, but be a serpent behind it,” she communicates to her spouse. Lady Macbeth, who aspires to be queen, goads her spouse to perpetrate crimes, hence determining their destiny. Without his wife’s convictions, Macbeth would not have executed all of these atrocious deeds.
The drama’s ending, which depicts Lady Macbeth’s madness and Macbeth’s demise, is the primary disclosure showing the corrupting impact of authority. When Lady Macbeth observes blood on her hands, Macbeth, who believed he was invulnerable, is assassinated. This couple forfeits something more vital: intellect and humanity due to their ambition for the throne. Therefore, the administration often not only reveals a person’s underlying undesirable inclinations but also leads to a fatal outcome.
Conversely, authority does not invariably lead to corruption for individuals who strive to enhance the lives of others. It also leaves behind those who are uninterested in acquiring it. Nevertheless, there are few such individuals: authority is generally granted to those who pursue it. The throne, for instance, was intended to belong to Duncan in Macbeth and subsequently to his progeny, who may also be a splendid king. Macbeth, however, attains the authority because he went to such lengths to secure it. Although authority does not always corrupt, it does devastate individuals in the majority of circumstances because it is acquired by those who are inclined to annihilate.
Authority corrupts those who possess it, and the pursuit of authority tends to lead to hardship. Macbeth showcases individuals who have endured due to their aspirations, unveiling the fatal nature of the longing for authority for its own sake. The drama’s culmination, which recounts Lady Macbeth’s insanity and Macbeth’s demise, thus, becomes a pivotal revelation that illustrates how authority corrupts. In Macbeth, the writer demonstrates the corrupting sway of authority: the protagonist’s and his wife’s lives spent pursuing the throne culminated tragically. Macbeth slays innocent individuals, including children, in his pursuit of authority. The wife’s aspiration becomes the impetus behind everything that unfolds: the semblance of the crown becomes more crucial than anything else in her life. The drama’s finale implies that individuals should not seek authority solely for the sake of authority. This production instructs individuals that authority and those in positions of power are not fundamental components of their life.
