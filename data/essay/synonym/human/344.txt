Imbalances and Surpluses
H2O
The quantity of food consumed was advisable on the initial day, but the nutrients were not evenly spread among the kinds of foods selected. According to the guidelines of water should be consumed regularly at least eight glasses a day. Water aids in eliminating harmful substances in the body, keeping our bodies hydrated, and aiding in weight loss (Knight 1). Water is also crucial as it assists in digestion and constitutes part of all the body fluids. Not even a goblet of water was included among all the diets chosen for the three days.
Proteins
The foods containing proteins ingested on the first day are well distributed although they have high calories. The foods containing proteins on the first day consisted of cheeseburgers, eggs, and yogurt. The sources on the second day, milk and chicken breasts, are also protein sources, but they also contain calories. The protein source on the third day has the highest calorie content, which is perilous. Proteins are essential in the diet as they are the building blocks of life; each cell in the human body comprises protein. The fundamental structure of protein is a chain of amino acids. One requires protein to assist their bodies in repairing cells and generating new ones.
Sources of proteins should not contain substantial calorie amounts as they are detrimental to health. Human bodies accumulate excess fats when we consume more calories than we expend. If this pattern becomes frequent, one may gain more weight. Weight gain may lead to obesity, which is a precursor to other health conditions that are detrimental to the body. Excessive calories are unhealthy, so the daily diet should contain minimal calories or engage in more physical exercises to burn them. Nutritional guidelines suggest that to maintain a stable weight, the energy input into people’s bodies must be equivalent to the one utilized during physical activities and bodily functions (Villegas 30). There are also minimal foods consumed over the two days that are protein sources like chicken and yogurt.
Potassium
Potassium is a mineral required by all the body’s cells. Since it possesses a slight electric charge that triggers frequent cell and neuron activities, it is also known as an alkali. Potassium is a natural mineral that can be found in various meals and taken as a supplement. Its primary function in the blood is to help maintain stable fluid balance in our cells. Sodium maintains fluid levels stable outside of cells. Potassium also aids in muscle contraction and supports regular heart rhythms.
Vitamins A and E
Vitamins are scarce in the diet as their main sources are fruits and vegetables, which are sparingly included in the diet. Another sparsely supplied nutrient in the three da diet is minimal. Vitamins are crucial as they are preventive foods. They shield our bodies from illness by bolstering the immune system. Fruits should be part of the diet consumed fifteen minutes before the meal. Eating them before meals ensures that the appetite is enhanced.
Iron
The sole meal in the diet that furnishes iron is the cereals consumed on the second day. Iron is vital for blood formation. About 70% of the body’s Iron is contained in blood, including in blood cells and deoxygenated blood found in cardiac tissues. Red blood cells are essential for delivering oxygen and nutrients to the muscles in your blood. Myoglobin accepts, stores, transports, and releases muscle fibers into the atmosphere. About 6% of the body’s Iron is found in proteins necessary for respiration and carbohydrate metabolism, as well as enzymes linked to the production of keratin and transmitters. Iron is also indispensable for healthy immune function. All the foods containing calories are energy sources, so energy-providing foods were well provided throughout the three days.
Calories
Calories were provided in surplus, and it is recommended that the individual increase daily physical activities to ensure they are expended. All the unhealthy foods contain a high calorie content. Calories are crucial for the body as they are the primary energy sources, but they should be consumed in controlled amounts. Hence, to carry out the basic life operations, the person’s body needs calories.
Zinc
Zinc is a crucial nutrient in the body, and the body does not naturally produce it, so supplementary foods are advised. It is a nutrient present in the body and aids the body’s immune systems and metabolic rate. Zinc is also vital for healing wounds and enhancing the sense of taste and smell. Through diverse nutrition, the body obtains sufficient zinc. Zinc can be obtained from various foods such as chicken, red meat, fortified breakfast, and cereals.
Proper Diet Recommendations
The nutritional principles dictate that people should avoid canned foods because they are unsuitable for their health. Packaged meals are highly detrimental to your health as they contain a variety of harmful components. People may opt to fuel their bodies with wholesome nutritious grains and fresh foods while shunning empty carbohydrates and hydrogenated oils. Consume 100 percent whole grains meals such as whole wheat tortillas, whole grain bread, and brown rice to provide the system with more sustained energy.
Breakfast is the pivotal meal of each day, so it is imperative to have it! Taking the mornings to consume a well-balanced meal will be exceedingly beneficial to your health. A well-balanced breakfast revs up your metabolism and kick starts your day on the right note. A poached egg, a cup of milk, whole wheat bread, fresh produce, and a cup of coffee are all excellent choices. One feels satiated and invigorated throughout the morning, and you will not reach for unhealthy snacks like crackers.
The nutritional principles will guide in planning the other meal. A good breakfast should encompass the following whole grains, such as waffles or cold grain whole cereals—lean proteins that include eggs, lean meat, legumes, and groundnuts. Fruits should also be part of the morning meals. Cereal is a smart choice as studies reveal that individuals who have cereal for breakfast ingest fewer carbohydrates and are much less likely to become obese than those who have other breakfast meals. However, cereals are not evenly distributed. The remainder of the lighter meals are requisite when the breakfast is substantial. Supplementary foods rich in calcium, potassium, Iron, and vitamins should be consumed.
Sources of Iron include; liver, but it is not recommended for expectant mothers, beans like red kidney beans and chickpeas, groundnuts, dehydrated fruits like apricots, red meat, and finally soybeans flour. Anemia, a condition characterized by low blood in the body, occurs when our diet lacks Iron. Girls who shed a substantial amount of blood during their monthly cycle (heavy menstruation) are more prone to developing anemia and may need to replenish with Iron. Calcium accounts for approximately 2% of the typical individual’s physique. Most of this is found in the teeth and bones; the rest is stored in the muscles or plasma. Calcium is essential for a robust skeletal system. It is also crucial for the health and operation of other physiological mechanisms, such as neurons and muscle access. Dairy products like cream, yogurt, butter, and calcium-fortified products like various plant-based milks (for example, nondairy milk and rice milk) and morning cereal are sources of vitamins and minerals like calcium.
Different life stages necessitate varying amounts of calcium: young children, adolescents, and elderly women all require more than the average intake. Although potassium and sodium are closely linked
