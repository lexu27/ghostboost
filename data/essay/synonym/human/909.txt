Rucol General Merchandise is choosing to deploy an enterprise resources planning (ERP) system that necessitates an excellent storage solution. The corporation has multiple branches with staff permitted to work remotely two days a week. A proficient storage solution for Rucol General Merchandise must fulfill certain criteria. Such qualifications consist of accessibility from various points, top-quality data security, cost-effectiveness, and reliability. As mentioned previously, Rucol’s employees telecommute at least two days a week. The corporation functions six days a week and manages more than fifty operational branches.

Possible storage options for Rucol comprise cloud storage, solid-state drives (SSD), and hard disk drives (HDD). Each of these choices presents benefits and drawbacks in the corporation’s scenario. SSDs and HDDs, for instance, offer more economical storage alternatives for Rucol. These two alternatives are readily accessible and do not necessitate a continuous internet connection for entry. Additionally, SSDs and HDDs supply outstanding offline data storage and backup solutions for organizations carrying out sensitive operations like Rucol. Shortliffe and Cimino (2021) remark that data storage solutions that can be isolated from the internet provide some of the finest data management options for confidential data. The assertion makes SSDs and HDDs suitable for the corporation.

HDDs arrive with ample space at a comparably reduced price compared to SSDs, rendering the former choice more fitting for Rucol’s scenario. Consequently, the company will employ HDDs for data backup in a high-performance computer without internet connectivity. Nevertheless, the optimal data storage choice for Rucol is the cloud storage platform. Selecting Google Drive will enable the corporation to obtain roughly thirty terabytes for $300 monthly. This decision will ensure data security, enhanced accessibility, and dependability (Weiland et al., 2019). Integrating the cloud alternative for data management during regular operations and an HDD system for backups assures the organization a superior solution for the data management predicament.
