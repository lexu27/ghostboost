Press liberty is a crucial component of the entitlement that societies experience in the contemporary world. It grants individuals the capacity to comprehend the perspectives of the government and other significant undertakings occurring within the nation. Freedom of media through platforms like electronics and social media fosters openness in the government’s actions and also encourages scrutiny of the functions it performs in ensuring it serves citizens appropriately. Despite the benefits of having journalists, some countries have regulations and constitutions that restrict what they are expected to cover and report. If the media contravenes the rules, their liberty is revoked, and the respective individual is brought before the court of law. In the United Arab Emirates (UAE), the freedom to publish and express is connected to certain constraints that render it delicate. To be able to reveal the truth on important issues, journalistic freedom should be expressed without restraint.
In the UAE, the freedom of opinion expression and other means of communications are subject to the law, making it difficult for the media to disseminate certain information that the regulation prohibits. The nation prohibits any type of media from criticizing the government and other allied nations. This limitation complicates the journalists' ability to report on critical matters the nation is addressing or expose illegal practices in operation. This leads the government to implement restrictive measures to safeguard its interests as outlined by the laws.
Federal law No. 15 of 1980 prohibits any individual from publishing and sharing anything without first obtaining authorization from the appropriate body. Article 14 of the law concerning publication prohibits print media from publishing any content for any party without UAE nationality (Younies & Na, 2020). It is compulsory to obtain approval from the relevant authorities to produce the materials. Moreover, the authorities determine the type of publication that can be distributed for sale in the country. Similarly, the law forbids anyone from distributing newspapers and other publications in public areas or along main roads without the necessary permission.
The law empowers the authorities to edit the published materials by removing or covering the sensitive parts that are not permitted for publication. Prior to distributing the materials to the public, both at the national and international levels, printing houses must submit a sample of the publications to the authorities for review (Shishkina & Issaev, 2018). If a media house produces a publication containing content that is prohibited from being printed, authorization will be withheld, or immediate censorship will be carried out to eliminate the offending section.
While the UAE constitution permits freedom of expression, it links it with the country’s legislation, which does not authorize the freedom of communication. Media outlets can publish any material but must adhere to the stipulated requirements (“UAE’s Constitution of 1971 with Amendments through 2004”, 2017). In the UAE, the only publications that print houses and journalists are allowed to share are those that support the government's views. Anything contrary to the authorities requires approval and potential editing before broadcasting or sharing on social platforms.
In 2012, the UAE enacted a law to combat cybercrime in the country. In line with the Federal Decree No.5 of 2012, the legislature has utilized this regulation to strengthen its restrictive measures on media freedom (Younies & Na, 2020). This regulation restricts the freedom of expression and publication of materials that go against religion, the ruling authority, and other sensitive aspects protected by the government. Consequently, this decree negatively impacts the country's printing houses and journalism practices. Disseminating information and images that are perceived to jeopardize security and disrupt public order can result in severe penalties for the respective journalist.
Numerous news reporters in the country have been detained and prosecuted for violating the penal codes established by the UAE authorities. This practice deprives journalists of their rights and freedoms in the country (Zayadin, 2021). Both local and international correspondents who contravene the requirements can be arrested and sentenced to imprisonment for breaching the regulations. The oppression faced by the media makes it challenging to exercise their freedom of the press, leading to the dissemination of distorted information for public consumption.
In the country, journalists are prohibited from publishing information about private individuals. According to federal law No. 3, the media is only permitted to print information with the consent of the individuals concerned. This regulation aims to prevent harm to the reputation of individuals in the country (“Supervision Policy,” 2022). Consequently, it becomes arduous for the press to freely express their opinions about respected individuals within the nation.
In the modern technological era, individuals can easily publish and access information through online platforms. This ease of access can result in the spread of false information that may disrupt public order or harm targeted individuals. With the existing restrictive measures, harmful news is prevented from interfering with the security system and the well-being of the populace. The penalties in place deter individuals from misusing technology to tarnish the image and reputation of the government and others.
This practice is crucial in curbing cybercrime activities that can mentally and financially harm victims. The advancement of technology exposes citizens to various risks from individuals seeking to exploit innocent citizens of their rights. Monitoring activities on media platforms would mitigate potential exploitation, such as blackmail through the unauthorized access to individuals' images and sensitive information. Therefore, government intervention plays a pivotal role in mitigating threats to ensure public privacy.
In conclusion, the UAE constitution has not firmly established the rights and freedoms of journalists. The lack of clarity makes it challenging for printing houses to operate and provide their services effectively in the country. Restricting press freedom limits access to crucial information and shields the government's secrecy from public scrutiny. Federal laws like Federal Decree No. 5 of 2012 restrict media freedom in publishing materials about individuals without their consent. Similarly, the constitution guarantees the freedom to communicate through any media form but subjects this liberty to legal provisions. The country's authorities are empowered to censor published materials before their dissemination to the public. Breaching penal regulations may result in severe penalties for journalists and media outlets. In this technological age, repressive measures are essential to safeguard citizens from the adverse effects of cybercrime activities that could damage reputations.
