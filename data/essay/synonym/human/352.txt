The matter of tribal autonomy has been examined over the years, the handling of tribes varying from supportive actions and efforts of integration into the wider community to outright persecution. In this context, the legislation concerning tribal gambling can be viewed as a favorable stride towards acknowledgment of tribes’ distinct way of life and self-governance. This article examines the query “how tribal gambling legislation can contribute to the autonomy of tribes?”

Under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, tribes were granted the authority to decide which gambling activities they wished to partake in, and typically, the authorization was given by the state. Gambling activities could encompass tribal ceremonies or games of luck, depending on the desires of the tribes and had to be approved by the state (Light and Rand). Since frequently tribal games are unique and hold a profound significance for the tribe, it would be accurate to state that granting tribes the privilege to conduct their own games is essential. This action helps to preserve their culture and assert autonomy over a very crucial aspect of life, which is recreation. Additionally, gambling aids in maintaining traditions and practices through ceremonies that have been shaped over the centuries.

Concerning autonomy, gambling helps to establish the domains of life that are entirely within the tribes’ authority. Hence, for instance, some tribe members blend with the general society, securing jobs or assimilating themselves into the urban life. Nonetheless, gambling, especially traditional tribal gambling, functions as a commemoration of one’s origins, advocates freedom of decision, and autonomy as it is the one thing that is nearly entirely within the tribes’ jurisdiction.
