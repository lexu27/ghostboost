The 1999 film Girl, Interrupted depicted life in a mental institution from the viewpoint of its inmates. The primary persona is Susanna Kaysen, a young woman who has completed high school, opted against attending university, and tried to end her life. The final event led to her confinement in a psychiatric facility, where she received a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder. The portrayal of Susanna in the film utilizing illumination, melodies, external and internal elements, themes, and interactions with others depicted her as an adolescent with a severe yet not incurable mental condition.

The leading lady is an attractive slender woman with cropped hair, fair complexion, and a distinct fashion sense. As the narrative unfolds, Susanna is skilled in writing, painting, and music. Nonetheless, this representation was crafted in the film to illustrate that even individuals like Susanna may grapple with numerous emotional challenges, including poor self-worth, defiance of societal norms, and unease. Nevertheless, some aspects of this character's appearance hint that the woman is sorrowful and tense. Particularly, her eyes seldom convey joy, particularly at the movie's onset.

Lighting also played a crucial role in Girl, Interrupted, but it was not employed to accentuate one character. Instead, whether at night or during the day, the light was cast on those engaged in a specific dialogue or quiet sequence rather than on a single character. This approach likely aimed to demonstrate that although the tale primarily revolved around Susanna, she was a minor part of a realm where individuals self-injure, deprive themselves of food, deceive others, and engage in aggression.

The music in Girl, Interrupted is chiefly melancholic to expose the protagonist's frame of mind. Susanna's discussions with therapists consistently coincided with the ticking of a clock, typically indicating that the character was in peril. In this instance, the woman is tormented by her own thoughts, potentially only months or weeks away from harming herself again. While most of Susanna's dialogues lack musical accompaniment, dramatic melodies emerge when she makes significant declarations and choices regarding her future.

The film's editing was designed to mirror Susanna's disquiet about her recollections and musings. The chronology of the narrative is not straightforward but instead regresses to unveil the woman's retrospections of challenging instances in her life. Furthermore, the film commences with one of the concluding and pivotal scenarios where the protagonist sits in darkness among fellow patients. It transitions to the scene where medical practitioners endeavor to rescue her following her suicide attempt when she insists her bones have vanished. This shift aimed to indicate that Susanna was uncertain about her sanity.

The movie producers employed external and internal elements to shape the character. For example, despite Susanna, an unconventional and theatrical name, being attractive, her demeanor, outlook, and conduct imply that this young woman may be grappling with emotional issues. Indeed, she appears uneasy in the presence of others and seeks to blend into the background by applying more powder to her complexion to make it paler and donning garments that conceal her physique to the fullest extent. Susanna's inner world revolves solely around sketching and chronicling random scenarios without a specific objective. Nonetheless, her interactions with Lisa disclose that the central figure is disoriented, yet she opposes brutality. Despite her initial aggression and impoliteness towards Lisa, Susanna eventually comprehends that she does not intend to remain institutionalized indefinitely. Consequently, her ultimate message conveyed her desire to integrate into the ordinary world despite its uncertainties, setting her on the path to recuperation.

To sum up, Girl, Interrupted is not merely a film about mental health patients but also the tale of an adolescent who wrestled with finding her niche in society. Susanna was an attractive and gifted yet anxious young lady. Her portrayal, engagements with other personas, and the film's editing were executed in a manner that indicated the protagonist's acknowledgment of her psychological challenges. Nonetheless, only genuine acknowledgment of these issues paved the way for her healing.
