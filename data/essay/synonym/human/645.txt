The four objectives of anti-prejudice education are shaping identity, advocating diversity, instructing justice, and encouraging activism. Identity development assumes that every child perceives themselves as an individual who identifies with a particular family unit. Diversity involves understanding and appreciating distinctions among individuals and cultures. Instructing justice entails guiding children to recognize where injustices occur and to treat all individuals with respect (Derman-Sparks & Edwards, 2019). Activism involves teaching children to be self-assured and unafraid to advocate for themselves. These objectives are significant as they enable us to educate individuals who will value others, be accountable for their behaviors, and be prepared to address injustices.

The obstacles of anti-prejudice education are fostering respectful behavior in children even towards individuals they may not favor, conquering timidity in class, and educating them to discern between right and wrong. During my childhood, I was extremely timid and it was a struggle for me to assert myself. What assisted me in managing was the welcoming environment fostered in class and the appreciation for diversities instilled in us by our educator.

Occasionally educators can also display bias and be unaware of it. Some teachers might give higher grades to students they favor and lower grades to those they do not. Some teachers assume that reserved students remain silent because they lack knowledge. It is crucial to acknowledge and alleviate these biases as they frequently restrict educational opportunities for children. To counteract biases one must empathize with others, view the world from their perspective, and consider all feasible alternatives. The entire society gains from addressing biases as individuals become more accepting of each other.
