Funding initiatives are considered welfare and net initiatives that the government takes to assist low-income families and individuals affected by poverty. These initiatives offset the fundamental needs of the citizens from health, food, housing, and education. Such an endeavor aims to allow people access to quality services and save some money for their personal growth. The topic of whether the funding of essentials causes an incentive or de-incentive to seek employment is a debatable one.
An example of a funded program is the supported housing, House Vouchers, and Public Housing programs. This scheme was initiated specifically for the poor and the disabled. Through the plan, citizens from economically low backgrounds and those physically impaired could afford to live in private and government-owned rental houses. Generally, it can be argued that the programs have a great potential of incentivizing recipients to seek employment. For instance, most job opportunities are found in urban centers. Having an initiative that makes life affordable in the towns and provides cheap residential houses encourages people to seek jobs in the cities. The fact that people can save some money from their salary motivates most people as it allows them to grow economically.
Following the COVID-19 pandemic, I perceive funded programs as essential for individual growth and the country’s economic growth. The pandemic, for instance, caused significant disruptions to international trade, the economies of most countries were destroyed, and most people were subjected to extreme poverty. Besides helping the poor afford a comfortable life, subsidies will enable the investors to re-establish their businesses and profit margins, therefore, rebuilding the country’s economy. In conclusion, funding initiatives are of paramount essence in a country as they support citizens with low-income levels and promote investment schemes that aid in economic development.
