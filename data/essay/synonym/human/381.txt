Defining a historical context of adolescent misconduct studies can offer valuable insights about society's advancements concerning adolescent misconduct regarding parental responsibility. Comparing the behaviors that were recognized as adolescent misconduct in ancient times and contemporary society can determine if current policies effectively deter young individuals from misbehavior. This essay will contrast how adolescent misconduct was perceived in Ancient Greece with how present-day society deals with adolescent transgressors.
Initially, investigating the historical origins of the adolescent misconduct notion could swiftly become perplexing because, historically, such a notion only emerged at the onset of the modern era. While there is no substantial data on youth misbehavior in ancient times, some accessible sources propose that misbehavior was endorsed among young men (Bates & Swan, 2021). Particularly, since masculinity and physical strength were highly valued in Ancient Greece, one could infer that the society was encouraging male youth toward violent conduct.
Exposing the youth to violent conduct and narratives from a young age contributed to the disorderly conduct of youth in Ancient Greece. According to Regoli et al. (2020), many narratives from Ancient Greek culture focus on intricate parental relationships with their offspring that culminate in the offspring's demise. Hence, the author proposed that adolescent misconduct stemmed from one's relationships with parents. While other sources suggest that in punitive actions, youth were treated as grown-ups, according to Bates and Swan (2021), the problem of adolescent misconduct could not arise at that time due to close family ties. Moreover, as physical penalties were prevalent in households during that period, the state did not need to stipulate particular penalties for youth misbehavior. The only regulation regarding adolescent misconduct present in ancient Greece was the decree that prohibited the youth in ancient Greece from assaulting their parents. Consequently, for instance, in instances where a young man committed misbehavior, he was chiefly answerable to his parents, and they determined the punitive actions, primarily entailing physical punishment.
Exploration of the historical setting of adolescent misconduct in the ancient epoch helps identify one notable contrast in parental involvement in contemporary society. In ancient Greece, the state promoted parental accountability for the child's misbehavior, and parents could opt for the punitive actions themselves. Conversely, parental involvement in adolescent misconduct is restricted in present-day society. Additionally, parents, educational institutions, society, and media are recognized as liable for the delinquent conduct of adolescent offenders.
Moreover, considering the punitive actions, the physical punishment commonly utilized in ancient times proved ineffective in the long term. According to Finkelhor et al. (2019), physical punishment can lead to adverse developmental consequences, such as psychological issues and subsequent hostility. In the past fifty years, the proportion of children subjected to physical punishment significantly dropped (Finkelhor et al., 2019). In contemporary times, prevalent penalties for adolescent offenders encompass therapy and counseling, fines, or obligatory community service hours. For instance, in cases where a young man committed misbehavior, he is answerable to the authorities and will be assessed based on the seriousness of his deeds. Lastly, the punitive actions for adolescent misconduct in contemporary society will never involve physical techniques.
In conclusion, this essay scrutinized the historical context of adolescent misconduct and juxtaposed how the state handled adolescent misconduct in ancient and contemporary times. The essay delineated that young Greeks were exposed to violent conduct from an early age in ancient Greece, and many had turbulent relationships with their parents. Furthermore, as the state held parents responsible for the children's misbehavior, parents were the individuals who selected the punitive actions, often resorting to physical punishment. In modern times, the state prohibits physical punishments due to their inefficacy and curtails parental involvement in adolescent misconduct, and transgressors are judged based on the gravity of their actions.
