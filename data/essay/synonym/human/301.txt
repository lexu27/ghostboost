Health advocates are a trained workforce whose primary aim is to enhance health through a variety of activities conducted by health promotion organizations. Individual empowerment, societal responsibility for health, and establishing a facilitating environment for developing personal skills and enhancing community action are among their top objectives (Nutbeam, 2019). In the realm of health promotion, experts from various multidisciplinary health workers have concurred on the characteristics of effective cooperation and an interdisciplinary approach.
Interdisciplinary teams’ most crucial goal is to bring together a variety of diverse perspectives on caring and to utilize the talents and knowledge of many different individuals and sectors. Intersectional cooperation between different health professionals and the public and commercial sectors is crucial for effective health promotion (US Department of Health and Human Services, 2018). The variety of these components shows that one’s health is not solely reliant on medical services or nurses and physicians (Nutbeam, 2019). The broad range of activities that constitute health promotion necessitates a diverse set of skills from numerous health professionals and industries.
Incorporating multidisciplinary experts within the health promotion team, such as Nurse Practitioners (NPs), Social Workers (SWs), and Registered Nurses (RNs), will be beneficial in both the long and short term. Nurse practitioners are nurses who receive additional education and training and are capable of treating a wide array of illnesses as well as providing preventative care and health education (Pun, 2018). Social workers have specialized training in aiding individuals and groups in developing skills and resolving challenges. Whether the problems are personal, interpersonal, or societal in nature, social workers can assist in guiding and addressing many of today’s challenges (Nutbeam, 2019). Registered nurses assess and evaluate healthcare requirements to determine the optimal service or treatment, the best healthcare provider, and the best equipment for delivering patient care (Pun, 2018). Hence, their expertise and approach will be crucial to the success of an interdisciplinary team assigned with health promotion.
