Rousseau’s discussion about the concept of self-love in its two forms is an attractive and enlightening one. The thinker distinguishes between amour de soi-même (self-love) and amour-propre (vanity), unique in their moral goodness. Indeed, on one side, self-love as a mere innate feeling of affection towards oneself is contrary to vanity. It could be described as “a natural emotion that drives every creature to be cautious in its preservation and that, guided in humans by logic and softened by compassion, creates kindness and virtue” (Rousseau, 106). Vanity, or egotism, on the other hand, is an opposing emotion, one that arises artificially in society due to the interaction of individuals with others. Specifically, the philosopher argues that it “compels each person to prioritize themselves over others, leading to all the harm people cause each other, and which is the genuine origin of esteem’ (Rousseau, 106). The two concepts differ in the nature of longing, which is inherent in the case of self-love, and contrived in the case of vanity.
The innate form of self-love lacks comparisons to others and exists in the natural world as a mere feature of an individual's necessity to strive and endure. This kind of self-love suggests that an individual does not require anyone else to validate their existence. Indeed, “each specific individual views themselves as the sole observer who watches them, as the sole entity in the cosmos that cares about them, as the sole arbiter of their own worth” (Rousseau, 106). Such affection is positive as it leads to human well-being, fostering self-reliance. Conversely, vanity or egotism is a negative form of self-love as it encourages competition with others in a community, ultimately resulting in atrocities. Because of vanity, individuals assess others in comparison to themselves and view them as inferior, ultimately committing wrongdoings.
According to the philosopher, the root of inequalities in various aspects of societal life lies in the adherence to the negative form of self-love. Initially, all humans were part of a natural world where all species were equal until a physical alteration in their makeup occurred. This led to variations in their physical and mental conditions. In particular, “improved or deteriorated and gained various positive or negative characteristics that were not inherent in their nature, while others remained longer in their original state” (Rousseau, 33). As time passed, with social connections, a moral or mental inequality arose due to variances in possessions and riches. The affluent gained more authority and freedom than the impoverished, resulting in social, financial, and political inequality.
In his novel 1984, Orwell reveals the fundamental characteristics of a totalitarian society. A totalitarian political system is a structure of state statutes and behavior that presupposes single-party governance focused on a singular idea, typically pursued through forceful and oppressive methods. To compel the populace to adhere to the totalitarian regulations, the rulers eradicate any prospect of individual achievement and enforce control to homogenize people as average members of a compliant society.
The political system in Oceania is built on the model of panopticism. It is a method of surveillance organized to situate a panopticon as a central controlling hub atop society with one center overseeing all individuals in the state. This approach is evident in the slogans that “a Big Brother is watching you,” in the hierarchical structure of the ministries, and the meticulous monitoring of each citizen's actions (Orwell, 4). This use of panopticism aims to divide individuals into vulnerable segments of society for easier control.
Indeed, a core feature of a totalitarian political system is the strategy of divide and conquer. This strategy involves breaking down social groups based on individuals’ personal accountability for their compliance or disobedience to the totalitarian state's rules. Throughout the narrative, it illustrates how “Big Brother is watching” each individual, isolating every citizen from a collective and scrutinizing their conduct (Orwell, 4). Winston, the protagonist of the story, is employed at the Ministry of Truth, where historical events are altered to align with the Party's ideologies based on each individual's accounts. In this manner, when a disobedient (previously divided and conquered) individual is removed, the historical records concerning that person may be altered.
A potent method of controlling the masses in the narrative is the utilization of a specially crafted language known as Newspeak. It is an official language derived from standard English aimed at reducing opportunities for critical thinking among the populace. Newspeak “was created not to extend but to diminish the scope of thought, and this objective was indirectly aided by reducing the word choices to a minimum” (Orwell, 287). Language is a medium through which individuals express their thought process. The simpler and more rudimentary the language, the easier it is to control the thought process of individuals, who become more susceptible to oppression and manipulation as mere components of a political and economic apparatus. For instance, the use of doublethink, a term denoting belief in contradictory statements as truth, is a method through which Newspeak shapes citizens’ perception of reality and distorts their memories, thereby serving the Party's interests at the level of human consciousness.
