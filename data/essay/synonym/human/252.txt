The document comprises a plethora of expressions by nineteenth and early twentieth-century artists where they communicated their feelings rather than the reality of their art. Expressionism is conveyed through intense emotions in artworks created by paintings or sculptures. That era was marked by cherishing emotionalism in artworks, like the romanticism period, which featured drawings representing the personal aspects of human beings (Arnason & Mansfield, 2012). The proliferation of secularism was extensive in the regions of Germany and Austria.
Numerous artworks in the chapter assist the reader in comprehending how artists expressed emotions. For instance, The Lion Hunt by Delacroix illustrates the violence and strength in society as depicted in the art (Arnason & Mansfield, 2012). Furthermore, Munch’s The Scream showcases expressionism as the artist conveys the theme of despair and isolation in society. Moreover, intense expressionism gained popularity due to the portrayal of women’s sensuality, such as Nude Girl by Lovis Corinth in 1886, as depicted in Figure 1 (Arnason & Mansfield, 2012). Thus, the chapter enables readers to acquire knowledge and interpretation of expressionism in the arts.
There was a revolution in art in the early twentieth century, where young painters took a new direction in art. Painting groups formed what was referred to as Die Brucke or ‘The Bridge’ association that aimed to connect all evolving elements in art (Arnason & Mansfield, 2012). Some painters in the association, like Ludwing Kirchner, expressed other fundamentals of expressionism, such as compassion and the transition of the new world. As shown in Figure 2 below, Kirchner sketched Girl Franzi, who later became a model in the Brucke group.
In Germany and Austria, artists then started creating sculptures that depicted the industrial revolution worldwide and the spiritual practices of communities. For instance, Vasily Kandinsky created Composition VII, which portrayed boats in turbulent waters, symbolizing the biblical flood as seen in Figure 3 below (Arnason & Mansfield, 2012). The style began to spread widely, allowing religion to be embodied in art. Other artists, like Gabriele Munter, began painting to capture modern relationships in society. Additionally, as Figure 4 illustrates, August Macke painted the Great Zoological Garden, showcasing the shift from the ancient era to modern society (Arnason & Mansfield, 2012). The art reveals the interconnectedness of the world through the environment and social divisions visible in various parts of the globe.
Sculptures interpreted various elements into the world, primarily during the romanticism period. For example, the Kneeling Woman by Wilhelm Lehmbruck in 1911 expresses the sorrow and despair women face in relationships with men (Arnason & Mansfield, 2012). The sculpture depicted the trauma and sorrow that Lehmbruck experienced during World War I, leading to his eventual suicide. Self-reflection was also a prevalent theme in Austria, as depicted in the Portrait of Paris von Guterslah by Egon Schiele in the 1890s (Arnason & Mansfield, 2012). The art portrays a disgruntled man who seems dangerous, reflecting the inhumanity prevalent in society, especially towards those lacking power or understanding of issues. From chapter 6, readers comprehend that artwork was defined by shifting values in both Germany and Austria.
