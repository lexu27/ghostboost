It is crucial to mention that cerebral matter is among the most intricate and elaborate structures of the human body, which has a highly restricted capacity for healing and regeneration. The subject of the suggested investigation is to evaluate how neural progenitor cells substitute and specialize into neurons and other cells of the brain to utilize them for therapeutic intentions. Neural progenitor cells must be utilized as a therapeutic intervention to decelerate or cease the aging process owing to their rejuvenation and specialization capabilities.

Review of Literature
Part 1
The initial research indicates that there is a complicated system of regulatory stages that involve GABA signaling. There is a variety of signaling molecules engaged in the ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ) neurogenesis, such as Sonic hedgehog, fibroblast growth factor 2, glutamate, and others. The subgranular zone (SGZ) is another crucial germinal region of the adult human brain, and the mechanisms of regulations are relatively distinct between V-SVZ and SGZ.
Part 2
For instance, a primary origin of the proposal states that “V-SVZ NSCs are regulated by local signals from their immediate neighbors, as well as by neurotransmitters and factors that are secreted by distant neurons, the choroid plexus, and vasculature” (Obernier & Alvarez-Buylla, 2019, p. 1). In other words, distantly situated cells secrete a broad array of signaling molecules to regulate the neural progenitor cell generation, specialization, and regeneration processes.
