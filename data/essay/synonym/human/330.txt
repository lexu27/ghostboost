Preamble
Storage drive malfunction is widespread among computers and leads to significant harm. The malfunction stems from various factors, including human mistake, computer hardware breakdown, malware corruption, media harm, and exposure to heat or water. Substituting the hard disk drive before it deteriorates entirely is wise to safeguard other hardware and software components (Fernández-Fuentes et al., 2022). While technology enthusiasts easily swap the HDD, individuals with limited familiarity with computer hardware struggle to replace it. These individuals with limited knowledge consist of first-time computer users and those who seldom engage with computer hardware. Novice computer users can adhere to this instruction manual to efficiently switch HDD without causing any harm to the computer hardware and software components.

These guidelines will enable the audience to switch the HDD from a defective computer gradually and power on the computer to test the new HDD. Although the process of replacing the HDD appears straightforward following this instruction manual, the computer user should possess fundamental computer knowledge. Help should be requested if users are handling computer hardware for the first time. Suitable helpers include computer specialists and authorized computer hardware vendors at the HDD purchase location.

General Procedures
HDD can be enhanced in a fully operational computer or a faulty notebook. To commence, the readers must verify that their essential data is duplicated on a secondary device such as flash drives or cloud-based storage like Google Drive. The computer must be turned off by adhering to the appropriate booting method. Subsequently, the power source should be disconnected to prevent any chance of electrical shock. Accurate guidelines, as specified in the HDD instruction booklet, should be pursued. Users should evade situating the new HDD near heat or magnetic fields that disrupt the storage mechanism. Prior to inserting the new HDD, remove the existing HDD cautiously. The computer should be allowed to start up after replacing the HDD. The process requires approximately fifteen to twenty minutes and should be conducted in a well-ventilated area at standard room temperatures.

List of Equipment and Tools Needed
Before initiating the process of replacing the HDD, several tools and materials are necessary. The tools will aid in averting static electricity, dust, electric shock, and other unsafe conditions for the computer and the user. Consequently, the user must procure a list of protective tools before commencing the process. The subsequent list of tools is essential when swapping the HDD in a computer.
  * Anti-static mat to shield the users and computer equipment from static electricity discharge
  * Anti-static vacuum cleaner to induce suction to eliminate dirt from the computer equipment
  * Anti-static wristband to be worn on the writs to prevent static electricity build-up.
  * 
  * Philips-head screwdriver to secure and expel screws
The readers should also ascertain that suitable materials are accessible before commencing the process. The subsequent list of materials is required to initiate the process.
  * A can of compressed air
  * 
  * A can of refrigerant-based propellant cleaner
  * A new hard drive disk
Sequence of Steps
The ensuing steps should be adhered to when changing HDD, and the readers should recall to disconnect the power supply and meticulously peruse the HDD’s manufacturers’ instructions.
Backup data on the existing HDD
Duplication of data should be executed if the existing HDD is still functioning. An external USB or online platforms like OneDrive or Google Drive can be utilized.
Acquire a complete, bootable Operating system copy
This step should be taken if you substitute a primary HDD and are not utilizing a cloning tool. The software can be procured on a DVD or downloaded on a flash drive by creating recovery media.
You should opt between an HDD or an SDD (Solid State Drive)
Despite SDDs being speedier and more robust than HDD, they are more costly. Nevertheless, the two function similarly, and you can select either based on your budget.
Select the appropriate driver for your computer
Diverse kinds of computers necessitate distinct types of HDDs with varying dimensions. If you are exchanging a laptop’s HDD, you require a 2.5-inch HDD, and if you are replacing a desktop’s HDD, you need a 3.5-inch HDD.
Turn off your computer by adhering to the correct procedure
Adhering to the suitable computer booting process aids in safeguarding the data and preventing damage to the prevailing hardware. Unplug the computer from the power supply after shutting it down.
Ground yourself before accessing your computer’s system unit
Utilize the anti-static wrist band while standing on the anti-static mat to avoid improper handling of the electronic components. The tools aid in preventing damage to the computer caused by electrostatic discharge.
Unlock the system unit case
This step varies depending on the computer being worked on: desktop or laptop. If you are working on a desktop, you need to unscrew the screws using the Philips-head screwdriver. Meanwhile, laptops either have special cases with unique doors for easy insertion and removal of HDD or require unscrewing of various components and removal of the battery.
Locate HDD in the system unit
HDDs are frequently fastened within a cage in the computer’s system unit. Upon identifying the HDD, identify power and data connectors and detach them from the HDD.
Ensure you have detached all the screws and disconnected the HDD
Utilize the Philips-head screwdriver to detach all the screws connecting the HDD to the system unit. If the computer case does not support the drive, you can utilize your hand to uphold the HDD. Subsequently, cautiously slide the HDD out of the cage and system unit.
Configure jumpers on an IDE drive if not utilizing a SATA drive
HDDs have diagrams illustrating the location of the jumpers and can configure the jumpers. Jumper setting establishes the drive as Master, Slave, or Select based on your preference and the original drive settings.
Insert the new HDD into position
The insertion should correspond to the original positioning of the old HDD. Afterward, cautiously fasten the HDD, reconnect the power and data cables, and close the system unit.
Boot the computer up with the recovery media inserted
This step can be omitted if you utilize cloning software, but the DVD tray should be ejected first if the recovery media is on a DVD. In the case of a USB, insert the USB before switching on the computer. The computer automatically powers up into the Operating System (OS) installer to boot up from USB or DVD drives.
Adhere to on-screen prompts to reinstall the OS
Upon reinstalling the OS, the computer automatically re-registers the OS. With a fully operative computer, you can reinstate the backed-up data. The computer is prepared for use and can be subjected to a diagnostic test to detect any malfunctions. Remember to store the old HDD securely in case you require it for future utilization.
