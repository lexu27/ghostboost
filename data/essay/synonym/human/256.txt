Outline
This document records Farcargo’s data system implementation strategy. It is split into different sections, which consist of a summary of the information system, a depiction of the key duties carried out during execution, and a roster of the assets needed (such as staff, equipment, software, and other items and facilities). This paper has been created continuously since the system design stage. It was subsequently revised in the development stage, and the final duplicate was produced during the testing and integration phase. This document will serve as a manual during the execution of Farcargo’s data system.
Intent
The primary aim of this document is to provide a framework of occurrences and steps that the project team will adhere to during Farcargo’s system execution. It also outlines significant duties and how each should be conducted to achieve the best results. An execution strategy sets the deadlines for the completion of various duties and functions as a communication and training strategy.
System Synopsis
As an internet-based organization, Farcargo necessitates a system that functions as its virtual office. Farcargo is a virtually based logistics firm that has expanded its operations globally. The firm’s system should feature a virtual aide who serves as the receptionist, a billing department, a data storage and retrieval division, operations and surveillance, and senior management. Farcargo aspires to have an information system that enables users to engage with them as in a real physical office.
System Explanation
The Farcargo information system can be categorized into three main parts, the user interface, application, and database. At the user interface, the system should enable the customer to create an account with the firm where they can access their data. The system stores the customers’ data into a database where only authorized personnel can access it. The customer can then access the company’s services and inquire about various products offered. Once content, the customer can reserve logistic service and the system automatically produces their bill. The customer is required to make a payment through the platform using a unique code generated during billing. The system then issues the customer with a receipt and their reservation is automatically scheduled on the system. The staff in charge of the delivery and the customer can view the scheduled date and is sent a reminder by the system two days prior to the actual date.
After our staff has received the goods to be delivered, the employee must alter the status of the schedule on the system to 'in transit'. The system detects this modification and sends a notification to the customer. The customer and the management can monitor the goods in transit by utilizing GPS technology and cameras inserted in the company’s transportation equipment. The employee transporting the goods can communicate with the management and customer if necessary. Upon the arrival of goods at their destination, the employee updates the status of the contract to "delivered" and uploads a few images as evidence. The customer should confirm the delivery and then change the status to "completed". The firm requests customers to provide feedback about the services offered to ensure they are provided with the best.
System Arrangement
The Farcargo system framework comprises hardware, software, and databases. Each user requires the hardware components to access the system. They consist of computers, mobile phones or tablets, and peripheral devices.

Explanation of Execution
The Farcargo information system shall require the construction of a website, a desktop application, and an android application. The three systems shall merge into one system to effectively support all the users' requirements. The website will serve as a foundation for all interactions whereby the users will conduct their interactions. The desktop and mobile applications will enhance quicker and simpler access to the system. These applications will enable the users to access their company accounts from a wide array of devices.
The system shall be launched in the new office facility that Farcargo is planning to move to in a few weeks. The system’s server shall be managed by Farcargo’s information management staff from the facility. The monitoring and control of various operational activities shall be carried out from the central server to be installed in the Seattle office. The desktop and mobile applications shall be developed and provided to various users for download through secure and verified vendors such as the Apple store and Google Play store.
The Farcargo information system shall be executed using the agile approach whereby the process shall be divided into smaller manageable tasks. Each small task shall be assigned to a specific team that shall develop it independently. This model allows for innovation and flexibility from the development team (Gramatikova, 2020). It shall also provide room for corrections and enhancements within the tasks. Upon completion of each sub-task, the team shall merge it to form one major system.
