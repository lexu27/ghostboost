Style and attire are components of a structure that nurtures social parity within the range of individualism. Lushch (2018) discusses the intricate method and occurrence through a summary of the modifications. The writer contends that "there is a duality across each person expressed through originality, and any inadequacy results in dissatisfaction with life" (Lushch, 2018). The primary aim of fashion involves integrating a dynamic and unique innovation among the different social categories. The investigator specifies that while it is essential to utilize originality, it is a concept that leads to the optimal marginalization of individuals from various sections associated with financial assets (Lushch, 2018). Trends in attire and design foster the ultimate stage for identification within the broad community while ascertaining the eloquence in preference. Thus, it is a custom that segregates the varied societies based on the subjective view of affluence.
The vital sociological pairs in fashion enshrine imitation and dissimilarity through the spectral understanding of diversity. In this instance, Whyte (2018) posits that the replication is a display of inexpensive products due to establishing the environment and anticipated quality within the market. Therefore, it is crucial to address the central problem underlying the influence of imitations on society to promote harmony. On one hand, it is an endeavor that encourages the connection across the global community. On the other hand, it is an illusion that creates the divide between the dynamic classes within a region. Whyte (2018) offers a profound insight based on the paramount aspect of eradicating mimicry and enhancing authenticity for alliances and actualization.
The other component of the sociological pair in fashion is the dissimilarity based on the significance of promoting authenticity and originality. According to Whyte (2018), the optimal value in design and style encompasses the importance of establishing a new trend for the elite social category that surpasses the previous levels. Thus, the distinction relies on the developers' level of inventiveness, thereby fostering the divide across the demographic populace. There is an interaction between diversity and imitation due to the impact on the quality of life and the shaping of the social identity. The optimal approach that enhances the unity across the global community is the establishment of common variables in vogue.
Dualism arises from the interplay of the sociological pair due to the concept of inheritance and variance. Whyte (2018) indicates that the conflict between collectivism and individualism establishes the core of involving individuals in the ever-changing society. It is crucial to determine the fundamental framework of ensuring optimal utilization of solutions during evolution to harmonize the diversity. The marginal anomalies of balance and performance in engagements identify the duality. In this scenario, people engage in various relationships based on integrating the ambivalence with the appropriate attributes in the fashion industry.
