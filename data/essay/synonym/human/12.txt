Horror flicks have turned into one of the core categories of cinema, the appeal of which is not inferior to the other genres. The cause for it is the particular reaction of the intended audience, specifically a potent emotional impulse. Furthermore, it serves as a psychological relief for some individuals, which aids in diverting attention from one’s issues. Horror movies are not the contemporary interpretation of public lynching; they establish a method for individuals to acquire a powerful emotional reaction through fear.
Fear is a primary human sentiment, which displays itself as an instinct for self-preservation, particularly a response to a potential threat. It might appear peculiar to someone that individuals pay money to experience such an unpleasant sentiment while viewing horror films. Nonetheless, in the essay Why We Crave Horror Movies, Stephen King contended that individuals strive to restore their feelings of crucial normality (King, 1). In simpler terms, someone endeavors to reset their usual sentiments for numerous reasons. Some are distracting from dilemmas in this manner, others receive a shot of adrenaline, and occasionally horror flicks transform into a method to release their sentiments in a movie theater and not onto other individuals.
Any art should elicit emotion and encourage the person undergoing moral pleasure. Watching horror movies appears to have no connection with the moral facet. However, the achievement of horror films, to a greater degree than other genres, relies on the audience’s reaction (Glasby, 7). The intense reaction sets horror movies apart in relation to the standards for evaluating art. Indeed, few individuals can remain entirely indifferent when witnessing frightening scenes. Additionally, the potent emotional reaction renders horror films so prevalent and thriving nowadays.
In conclusion, it was determined that horror films do not establish a type of contemporary public lynching. They are one’s approach to receiving the vivid, emotive reaction. There are various reasons for it, commencing from attaining psychological release and culminating in diverting from reality and one’s pressing issues. The audience’s reaction is the crucial aspect in assessing the success of horror films and why they are viewed as art.
