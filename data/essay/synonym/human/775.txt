Prelude
Although each era is believed to have left its own mark on society, the 1960s are enshrined in the recollections of many, even if they were not yet alive at that time. A decade brimming with affectionate hippies, The Beatles captivating the hearts of Americans from overseas and the surging popularity of the civil rights movement. With activism on the rise and an aura of hope and transformation in the atmosphere, it is simple to overlook the adverse aspects of the 60s, which were all too genuine. The Vietnam War, the urban riots, and assassinations played a pivotal role in molding the decade and acting as a pivotal moment in American politics and society. In 1968, the US transitioned into the Sixth Party System, with the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968 serving as a defining moment in American politics and society.
Context
American Politics Pre-1960s
Throughout the years in modern United States history, there have been numerous variations of the party systems and political frameworks in the efforts to address the distinctions between Democrats and Conservatives. The preceding party system, the Fifth, was instituted in 1932 during Franklin D. Roosevelt's presidency. Under such an arrangement, the opposing factions, New Deal Coalition and Conservative Coalition, comprised members from each of the original parties, namely Democrats and Conservatives. Nevertheless, the intra-party ideological factions did not persist for long, and following the occurrences of the 1960s, including the Civil Rights movement and Cold War, the decade ushered in the Sixth Party System. Consequently, Republicans and conservative principles gained more prominence in the US political landscape, overshadowing the Democrats for years to follow.
Crucial Occurrences of the 1960s
As previously mentioned, the 60s are renowned for their profound impact on the events of that time and the subsequent decades. The key incidents leading up to the political transformations in 1968 regarding the party system encompassed both domestic and international affairs. The decade was marked by the Cold War and the Vietnam War, the Civil Rights movement, the killings of Martin Luther King Jr. and John F. Kennedy, the Cuban Missile Crisis, and the lunar landing. While these events may appear disparate, collectively, they instigated societal and political changes that facilitated the reduction in government intervention in the economy and laissez-faire capitalism. Additionally, the ascent of Christianity in the US facilitated the widespread appeal of conservative principles. Americans were no longer willing to compromise their beliefs, amalgamating the conflicting viewpoints, which led to the divergence of conservatism from the democratic ideology and the establishment of two distinct parties.
The episodes of the 1960s underscored to American society the necessity for restricting governmental authority in decisions made on behalf of the populace. Millions protested against military actions and the apathy of the American people, as evidenced in the Port Huron Statement by the Students for a Democratic Society, 1962 (“The American Yawp Reader,” 2022). This bold declaration put forth by young activists underscores the urgency for action to rescue American society from ruin caused by excessive militarism and cultural alienation.
Not only were the activist movements of the era vociferous and disruptive, but they were frequently acknowledged by authorities and even alluded to, such as in Lyndon Johnson’s address on Voting Rights in 1965 (“The American Yawp Reader,” 2022). By employing the rhetoric of the activists and the commitments made to Americans in prior years, he conferred legitimacy and validation to the societal shifts. Concurrently, Americans were striving for the preservation of their identity and personal freedoms. It is unsurprising that, consequently, government interference in the economy waned, and the prevailing public ideology reverted to traditional values, especially after the liberal years that preceded it.
Aftermath
Who Emerged Victorious?
As a consequence of the aforementioned political changes, the Republican party emerged triumphant. In contrast to previous decades, the parties were no longer blended in their composition, and instead, the majority of the power resided solely with the conservatives. While the Democrat party maintained its influence over certain states, the majority of the populace became or remained aligned with the Republicans. This novel era was initially known as the Raegan era and has since withstood various events and occasions.
Conclusion
As previously stated, the parties diverged once more, with the conservatives and the democrats securing their own positions at the table. Initially, the alterations led to a surge in the favorability of conservatives; however, in recent years, the Democrats have started to regain their popularity. The disparities in ideologies persist as pronounced as ever, and the extreme opposition between the two parties inhibits effective collaboration. Nonetheless, it is plausible that a new party system will be established soon, whatever form it may take. What is evident is that history demonstrates how societal changes propel political and structural transformations and vice versa.
