Introduction
In every healthcare environment, the requirement to achieve optimal patient care necessitates nurses to uphold ethical practices and adhere to the specified principles effectively. The connection between the sick individual, relative, and practitioner is crucial for ensuring improved services to the ailing person. Often, nurses encounter complex situations that demand them to make rational decisions while considering the well-being of the client and family members (Bratz & Sandoval-Ramirez, 2018).
Such demanding moments require the caregivers to critically apply the principles of beneficence, non-maleficence, autonomy, and justice to ensure they adequately attend to the clients appropriately. Ethics enable nurses to identify ethical dilemmas in the work environment and make prudent judgments and practical decisions based on their values and beliefs while upholding their behavior within the regulations that govern their profession.
Based on Mr. Newcomb's current health status, I would authorize the request to meet his lover. Firstly, Mr. Newcomb is at a critical stage of pancreatic cancer, and considering all the suffering he is enduring, it would be fitting to acknowledge his desire. Presently, he is under hospice care, where the primary focus is to ensure he receives quality time and comfort before his passing. At this juncture, anything that brings joy to Mr. Newcomb holds utmost significance for his existence. He requires something that can bring him joy to prolong his days.
Declining the request would erode the trust Mr. Newcomb has in me, and he might begin to withdraw his attention from my services, which would be catastrophic for his well-being. Hence, to sustain the connection and ensure he receives quality care, I would ensure his wishes are fulfilled. This action would be beneficial for the patient's health, but it may appear disloyal to his wife. As a nurse, I will keep it confidential after inquiring about the relationship between Mr. Newcomb and the lover from him. Once I ascertain that the relationship is healthy, I will devise a way to facilitate the patient to meet his companion.
Principle of Beneficence
In healthcare, the principle of beneficence mandates a nurse to be compassionate and act in a manner that benefits the patient. Caregivers are expected to advocate for the welfare of sick individuals by preventing any harm while upholding ethical standards (Giles et al., 2018). In Mr. Newcomb's case, he expressed the desire to meet his lover, and this action would bring him joy and happiness that, in turn, enhanced his health condition. Permitting interaction between the patient and the visitor aligns with the principle of beneficence. Simultaneously, keeping it confidential from his wife safeguards him from guilt and fear that could negatively impact his well-being, potentially reducing his lifespan.
Principle of Non-Maleficence
The principle of non-maleficence prohibits nurse practitioners from engaging in any action deliberately that could cause harm to the patient. Considering Mr. Newcomb's situation, refusing his request would subject him to stress and anguish given the sensitivity of the wish. Therefore, finding a way to grant him the opportunity to meet the lover would be highly beneficial to his care. I was already aware that denying permission would lead to more distress for the patient; thus, intentionally declining would contradict the principle of non-maleficence (Ilkafah et al., 2021). Upon weighing the consequences of denying versus granting the request, accepting it offers more advantages for Mr. Newcomb's well-being, which is crucial for his hospice care management.
Principle of Autonomy
The principle of autonomy empowers patients to make independent decisions regarding their needs. In Mr. Newcomb's scenario, he possessed the right to autonomous practice. Therefore, it was ethical to enable him to exercise his self-governing capacity. Upon hearing the patient's request, I had to evaluate his ability to proceed with the wish. If he was capable, then the principle applied, allowing the individual to explore his self-determination. By permitting Mr. Newcomb to meet his lover based on his decision, I adhered to the principle of autonomy to enhance patient care services.
Principle of Justice
In nursing, the principle of justice necessitates nurses to exhibit fairness, impartiality, and equality for all patients. The principle advocates for acknowledging a sick individual's dignity regardless of their status (Silva & Oliveira, 2020). In Mr. Newcomb's case, I would uphold the standard by enabling him to meet his lover. This action would align with the requirement of justice, which is to be equitable to the patient. Demonstrating justice would signify care for the individual, thereby bolstering his emotional resilience towards the services he is receiving in the facility.
Beliefs and Values
Generally, personal beliefs and values exert a significant influence on ethical conduct in the work environment. Education, past encounters, and culture are pivotal factors that substantially determine how an individual manifests moral behaviors (Sari et al., 2018). I uphold the notion of providing care for individuals in need, and this concept has been instrumental in resolving dilemmas. In Mr. Newcomb's scenario, my decision was largely guided by the value of compassion, compelling me to take necessary steps to alleviate his constant suffering. Drawing from my nursing experience, depriving patients of their desires can lead to despondency and loss of trust in the caregiver. Therefore, besides the ethical principles, my beliefs and values would influence the decisions I make concerning a patient's well-being.
Strategies for Promoting Self-Care
Generally, nurses partake in various initiatives to ensure patients receive optimal care within the facility. It is their duty to ensure the well-being of sick individuals is achieved. Their responsibility demands unwavering focus and dedication to ensure they provide excellent care to patients. They, therefore, require effective strategies to enable them to enhance patients' self-care to improve the quality and safety of their health (Wang et al., 2019). This practice enables patients to maintain good physical and mental health while undergoing treatment to help them combat the stress and pain of the illness. Some approaches, such as regular physical activity, nurturing relationships, and adopting healthy dietary habits, foster self-care among patients.
Practicing Healthy Dietary Habits
The type of meals patients consume has implications on their health. Nurses should ensure that sick individuals have a balanced diet to fortify their immune system. They should also ensure that sugary foods are avoided due to their adverse effects. Embracing healthy eating practices would equip patients with the necessary energy for physical well-being. Caregivers should promote the intake of foods that facilitate better nourishment.
Engaging in Regular Exercise
Incorporating routine physical exercise is pivotal for a patient's health. Nurses should counsel sick individuals to establish a structured regimen for engaging in physical activities. This practice would aid patients in alleviating anxiety, depression, and trauma associated with the ailment. Furthermore, physical activities would imbue patients with a sense of engagement, thereby enhancing their focus and happiness. Implementing simple workout routines would maintain their physical fitness to endure the ordeal of the illness.
Nurturing Relationships
Sick individuals require a strong sense of belonging to foster feelings of love, thus mitigating stigmatization. Nurses should encourage patients to interact frequently with their loved ones to ensure they feel a sense of inclusion irrespective of their health status. Moreover, fostering close connections would reduce stress
