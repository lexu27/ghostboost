The antiquated historical documents on Minoans published by Halsall reflect certain truths about their history discovered much later than these records had been compiled. Specifically, Plutarch’s tale about Theseus illustrates the concept of the absence of defensive structures in Crete. As per this manuscript, Theseus attacked the island’s harbor and seized it swiftly as its inhabitants confused his fleet for their own. This aspect could emphasize the reality: Minoans were traders and did not establish extensive protections. Furthermore, Herodotos’ manuscript portrays the annihilation of Cretans, which aligns with the archaeological evidence, albeit they cite the eruption as the primary cause for the downfall of Minoans.

British Institute at Ankara’s video about Helen of Troy is quite enlightening concerning the portrayal of women in ancient eras. Accordingly, Helen was viewed as the most splendid and feminine individual for many centuries in Athens as well as Sparta. Additionally, it is acknowledged that she was worshipped as a deity in Laconia. Greeks frequently represented Helen using the most valuable materials, symbolizing the significance of this figure. This lady was conventionally seen as a temptress and even the source of grief in Ancient Greek society. Moreover, the depiction of Helen of Troy has transcended time and is still utilized as a synonym for beauty.

Evelyn-White’s rendition of Hesiod’s Theogony offers valuable insights into the Greek religion. Hesiod delineates the deities as anthropomorphic entities who simultaneously possess natural authority or embody facets of the universe themselves. For instance, the Earth and the Heaven are partners that give rise to other gods, often linked to sentiments or natural occurrences. The narrative of Heaven (Uranus) being emasculated by his rebellious offspring, Chronos, is notably intriguing. The conflict between generations and the toppling of the elder by the younger is also evident in Mesopotamian, Scandinavian, and other mythologies. Hesiod’s poem elucidates the Greek understanding of deities: the primal entity and their progeny wielding boundless authority in the world, yet beings with human feelings and intentions.

Women by Semonides of Amorgos, issued by Temperance, portrays male Greeks’ anticipations for their women. The writer lists the categories of women shaped by Zeus and essentially function as an everlasting retribution for mankind. Semonides characterizes females who are unattractive in a satirical manner, while he disapproves of women who prioritize their appearance and cleanliness. Furthermore, he laments about women who overly concern themselves with their household, as well as those who maintain it inadequately; vexation shown by wives also dissatisfies him. In Semonides' view, an ideal spouse should be akin to a bee: toiling joyfully and tending to her family. Additionally, she should be a competent homemaker and refrain from revelries with her companions.

Sappho’s Hymn to Aphrodite is a captivating poem for various reasons. Initially, it suggests that mortals and deities can communicate; individuals can implore the aid of the divinities and anticipate it to be granted. This notion implies that gods can be both kind and harsh, and the destiny of humans is perpetually subject to their discretion. Furthermore, this verse signifies that Aphrodite is a goddess of love who influences human relationships by exerting her authority. Thus, by entreating Aphrodite to cease the conflict and join the fray, Sappho invokes the favor of the goddess for a person who has disheartened her romantic endeavors.
