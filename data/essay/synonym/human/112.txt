Boeing is the largest airplane manufacturer of all time, with success stories running throughout U.S business history. The company is well-known for its commercial jets and contribution in space and security. William E. Boeing founded the company in 1916 in Seattle before relocating to Chicago (O’Connell, 2020). Boeing commenced manufacturing by converting a building plant designed for wooden boats. The company earned its first revenue from the United States military and subcontracted it to develop airplanes. Due to the impact the firm had in the market, the owner concentrated on ensuring that he gathered input and suggestions from all staff members.
Boeing also designed airplanes specifically made to deliver mail to distant cities and towns in the country. The airplanes offered a quicker way for people to exchange information despite facing distance barriers. This compelled the company to modify its business model to include airplane manufacturing and flights. In 1931, Boing converted other airlines into a single one to establish United Airlines (UAL) and also acquired other airplane manufacturing companies to broaden its operations (O’Connell, 2020). Later, the firm altered its name to Boeing Airline Company and played a significant role in developing military aircraft used during World War II.
After the war ended, Boeing shifted back to producing commercial aircraft for single trips across the country. This implied that the company had to phase out airplanes that used propellers and adopt turbojets. Boeing started receiving substantial orders from the United States air force, which led to the introduction of the 707, frequently used by Pan American Airlines. This airplane model was the public’s preferred choice as it enabled them to travel from one city to another within a few hours. Becoming the public’s favored aircraft allowed Boeing to handle large orders for the airplane model. The high volume of orders for the 707 prompted Boeing to develop the 737 and 747, which impacted the production process, nearly resulting in the company declaring insolvency.
As Boeing contemplated the production of the 747 models, the industry was struck by a recession that served as a barrier to domestic carriers acquiring new aircraft. The production of the 747 was also affected when the company commenced building the 2707 model, whose production had been suspended due to the high costs involved. Nonetheless, the 747 became the highest-selling aircraft as they were larger and had swifter engines (Hayward, 2020). Boeing never relinquished the airplane model, which proved successful. The company has witnessed an increase in revenue stemming from its diverse product line and a high number of orders from customers. Over time, the company has established multiple subsidiaries to manage various operations. Despite being a behemoth in the aircraft manufacturing sector, Boeing still faces numerous competitors vying to surpass its position.
Boeing initiated the expansion of its operations to facilitate the production of helicopters. Boeing’s assembly lines also integrated the manufacture of missiles for the military, with the first missile being launched in 1962. Boeing also broadened its processes to allow air and land craft construction, with NASA being the primary client. This enabled the company to fabricate rockets to transport human beings to the moon and back. The firm also crafted vehicles tailored for the space shuttle mission organized by NASA until the project was terminated. Boeing subsequently produced the 757 and 767 airplane models, which were more advantageous since they were utilized in flying and training exercises. This helped reduce costs required to procure aircraft designed for the two processes differ. Boeing was also engaged in overseeing a housing project aimed at developing various initiatives to enhance housing in the country.
The 777 models from the company utilized a design and manufacturing software that was computer-aided. Boeing managed to save time and resources when constructing the aircraft by skipping the creation of a physical frame initially. The firm later transitioned to the production of the 787 Dreamliner, which encountered significant production issues. The airplane repeatedly failed stress tests and encountered production defects, which hampered the manufacturing process. The airplane model was subsequently grounded as they exhibited a high risk of batteries catching fire. Nonetheless, the 787 became the fastest and most fuel-efficient commercial aircraft in the industry. The diverse airplane models produced by Boeing have enabled the firm to emerge as a top manufacturer globally.
Boeing has hired over 140,000 individuals in various countries. Being situated in different parts of the world has allowed the company to acquire one of the most diverse and skilled workforces (Boeing, 2017). The company also focuses on providing its customers with service solutions for the wide array of products available in the market. Boeing offers customer support that is active to ensure that aircraft function with high efficiency and enhance mission assurance. Boeing also operates a capital corporation that offers its customers a wide range of financing solutions. This helps ensure that they have adequate funds to purchase different aircraft products, thereby minimizing challenges likely to be faced due to insufficient funds.
