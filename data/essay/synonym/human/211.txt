Ensuring Effective Budget Control
A sturdy organizational framework is necessary for budgetary efficiency. Permanent specific matters, like a finance committee and a budget supervisor, should be set up. To prevent obstructions, budget preparation must be thoroughly integrated. Budgets for individuals should be synchronized with one another. Budgets must be assessed regularly to prevent them from deteriorating into a permit to expend the entire authorized sum even when it is unnecessary. As per Dauda (2019), “business organizations of all kinds must partake in financial planning at any level to guarantee prudent deployment of resources for accomplishing organizational objectives.” Employees should be suitably rewarded for performance in line with the budget. In contrast, careless staff should not be criticized.
Psychological Aspects of Budget Control
Budgetary control is a vital tool for evaluating performance. However, results require time to materialize. Those responsible for financial oversight should possess extensive knowledge and expertise in the field. Employees are adjusting their work practices, routines, and even their connections based on finances. Consequently, employees may display hesitancy towards change. This necessitates crafting each budget with the endorsement of top management. Every staff member's needs are thoroughly delineated and disseminated in a formal structure. In this scenario, they will understand their authority and duties, which will be beneficial for budget management. The efficiency of a financial management scheme relies on the organization's specified objectives. Therefore, when setting goals, management should proceed cautiously. Moreover, the objectives are well-defined.
