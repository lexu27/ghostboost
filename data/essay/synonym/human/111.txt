Wage
Pointers, perks, and overtime pay are not encompassed in the wage when working as a BCBA. In the USA, the mean BCBA salary is about $62,000 per annum and the lowest ten percent earn $47,000 per annum, whereas the top ten percent receive $97,000 per annum, excluding perks (Epstein, 2020). BCBA workers at the starting level gain around $57,000 per annum, with yearly salaries increasing in the subsequent sequence: Modest beginnings: $60,000, immediate post: $65,000, and late-career obtain about $75,000 to $68,000 for a seasoned BCBA and $71,000 in final years (Dounavi et al., 2019). As an individual cultivates proficiency as a BCBA, you can expect your earnings to escalate.
Similarly, an individual’s workplace can have a considerable impact on the remuneration. A BCBA who is employed in the private sector, for instance, generally receives more pay than a BCBA who works for a state agency or educational institution. BCaBAs earn an average of $44,000 each year, with the highest earners receiving over $70,000 after rewards (Lotfizadeh et al., 2020). Nonetheless, the yearly pay for BCBAs frequently tends to increase with time.

For an individual to become certified, all BCBAs must fulfill rigorous requirements, albeit some BCBAs are in fiercer competition than others due to added skills. BCBAs with proficiency in clinical administration, ABA, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Structural Analysis, and developing processes and standards are sought after by employers. BCBAs with functional analytic skills, for instance, experienced a salary increase of 5%, while clinical supervision skills can enhance your pay by approximately 2% or more (Lotfizadeh et al., 2020). Despite the current high demand for BCBAs, possessing extra skills can provide you with assurance and generate more income.
The BCBAs are recognized for their robust and efficient communication and a desire to educate and aid others. They are adept at interpreting individuals’ moods and body language. BCBAs must assess a patient’s behavioral problems and devise the suitable treatment plan for that individual (Lotfizadeh et al., 2020). The patient’s condition frequently dictates their approach; for instance, someone with autism will react differently than someone with a personality disorder.

Expertise
A professional who has achieved certification in applied behavior analysis is a Board-Certified Behavior Analyst. The Behavior Analyst Credential Board grants the certification to BCBAs (Epstein, 2020). For those aspiring to practice, BCBAs must have obtained a master’s degree and be board-certified before commencing work independently, and they typically require approximately six years to complete their education and gain experience.
Behavior analysts need to demonstrate that they have undergone the necessary level of training in one of three ways. Practicum, which entails a minimum of 1000 hours of practical experience under strict supervision, independent monitored research work requiring at least 1,500 hours of practical experience under the guidance of a qualified behavior analyst. An Intensive practicum that necessitates no less than 750 hours of practical experience under the most rigorous supervision is mandatory (Epstein, 2020). BCBAs often undergo on-the-job training to comprehend the organization’s systems and procedures after securing employment.

The expansion of the market for BCBAs results from an increase in public awareness of autism and the utilization of applied behavior analysis as a therapeutic approach. Individuals also acknowledge the value that a qualified BCBA can bring to other sectors (Dounavi et al., 2019). The following professions are heading towards a surge in demand for behavior analysts: treatment for substance abuse, conduct gerontology, sports behavior psychology, sustained environmental stability, and pediatric psychiatry. There has been a significant expanding market for BCBAs due to a recent broadening of the applications of behavioral analysis and therapy for patients.
