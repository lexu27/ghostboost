Despite engaging with numerous deities along his route, the goddess Athena remains notably significant due to her role as the champion of the hero. Athena has consistently shielded the hero from peril, ensuring his triumphant journey.

In this manner, Poseidon sought to impede the hero’s journey, showcasing one of the numerous instances of the deity’s critical role in Odysseus’ expedition. Ultimately, Polyphemus endeavored to harm the hero and his comrades; nevertheless, Odysseus manages to outsmart the cyclops.

Therefore, the encounter with Polyphemus illustrates Odysseus’ cunning and marks a pivotal moment in The Odyssey.
