Swot Analysis
Strengths
Diversicare Primary care has a strong reputation for delivering high-quality services to its clients. Additionally, medical care secures the enduring loyalty of both Staff and clients. There is a skilled and competent bi-cultural team bilingual and, in addition, responsive Staff eager to enhance their expertise. However, the Ethnic Society Council Queensland’s (ECCQ) Public Compassionate Institute (PBI) Co-payment Gift Recipient (DGR) aims to improve corporate practices and essential amenities.
Weaknesses
One of Diversicare's shortcomings is a deficiency in technical skills and competencies among its Staff. The aging workforce of the company is also a hindrance to growth. Furthermore, a portion of experienced colleagues are nearing retirement. Two government-funded programs contribute to 85 percent of the organization's total revenue (Diversicare, 2021). Consequently, Diversicare healthcare encounters another obstacle due to the absence of a long-term strategy for board members and senior executives. As an ECCQ division, this organization lacks legal standing, posing a risk to the establishment. Subsequently, Diversicare's structure has too many implementers for the current level of activity/business, which is a concern for healthcare.
Opportunities
The demand for Aged Care CALD Sector has risen, especially for high-level care services like EACH, EACH-D, and Transition Care. Additionally, existing User Pay Services are expanding, along with the utilization of advanced technologies to ensure service quality, particularly with their in-home facilities. There are also strategies to extend geographical coverage to the Gold Coast and major cities and CALD regions in Queensland (Stapleton et al., 2018). Demographic trends indicate a growing number of CALD working-age individuals relocating to Queensland. Existing HACC and CACPS operations can be expanded, and proposals for capital and economic expansion funding can be formulated for submission to the government.
Threats
One of the hazards to Diversicare healthcare is the conflict issues in the federal political environment. Significant competition from domestic and international for-profit and non-profit organizations is also a potential threat now and in the future. Another risk is sector consolidation through mergers, amalgamations, and acquisitions. Ongoing public scrutiny on the ECCQ – the industry's peak body – investigating the reasons for providing aged care and public support services is also a potential risk to healthcare. Ultimately, the technical skills, training, and knowledge required to deliver future aged care services pose a significant risk.
Financial Analysis and Budget
Diversicare has indeed been competent in providing post-acute and benefactor care globally. However, their patient volume has increased even further, necessitating them to put patients on a waiting list until space becomes available. Following financial scrutiny, additional beds are proposed to be opened to accommodate more patients. This healthcare aims to offer nursing, home healthcare, and interpersonal services to patients and residents.
Moreover, the company's nursing centers provide an array of services, including nutritional support services and comprehensive rehabilitation services.
Diversicare corporation owns over 75 healthcare and assisted-living facilities, totaling approximately 8,500 beds (Ginthotavidana & Waidyasekara, 2021). The medical Center plans to enlarge the bed count to cater to more patients. Diversicare, which focuses on rural areas, provides various healthcare services, such as residential care, recreational therapy, welfare care, and clinical, cardiovascular, rehabilitative, and other tailored ancillary services. Table 1 presents the basic budget for the strategic initiative.

The anticipated profit and loss statement of Diversicare has been formulated. The overall net income of the proposed hospital is $356210. Based on the expected balance sheet, the hospital will incur $1500000 in debt and $500000 in equity to finance current assets and procure the land and equipment for the hospital construction. Table 2 illustrates the asset and liability ratio, considering the adopted strategy. It should be noted that the current revenue current ratio will be close to one, indicating the potential for growth in the company's liquidity and relevance.

Strategy
Strategic planning aids in evaluating an organization by capturing its mission, vision, and values to achieve long-term objectives and utilize appropriate strategies to attain them. A sound corporate strategy is vital to a firm's advancement and profitability as it provides a fresh perspective on how to respond to various strengths and threats encountered by employees and management. It offers a sense of the endeavors to be undertaken and the paths to be pursued by focusing on the goals and priorities. Scrutinizing the strategic plan uncovers the strengths and the areas necessitating improvement.
Numerous specific objectives must be set to acquire more beds. One goal is to schedule the expansion or construction of a new facility with an additional 78 beds to accommodate more patients. Cash flow needs to be examined for the resources required to achieve the hospital goals in a reasonable timeframe. Once the budgetary allocations are approved, a suitable location near the agency or university needs to be identified to construct the expanded facility. Another objective will be to recruit more healthcare professionals to cater to the extended facility. Diversicare will be a step closer to serving more service users once all objectives are met. With these additional beds, Diversicare will reduce their waitlist and treat more patients.
This significant expansion will create more job opportunities for healthcare professionals in the city and
