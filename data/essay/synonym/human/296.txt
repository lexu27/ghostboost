Gustave Moreau is a celebrated Symbolist who evoked the themes of ancient myths in his creations. An instance of such an artwork is Jupiter and Semele, which he crafted in 1985 in France (Smith par. 1). The narrative depicted on the canvas originated from Ancient Greece, subsequently assimilated and summoned by Romans. Specifically, Jupiter, the supreme deity of the Roman pantheon, fell in love with Semele, a mortal woman, whom he impregnated. His enraged wife, Juno, deceived Semele into pleading with Jupiter to reveal his true appearance to her. This desire was granted, yet the divine essence of Jupiter’s manifestation exceeded the boundaries of what a human can perceive and endure, so Semele perished, and her offspring was extracted from her body. Moreau’s creation illustrates this tragic storyline and signifies the theme of the disparity between humans and the divine by portraying Jupiter and Semele on the edge of heaven and the underworld.

The mentioned piece of art may appear somewhat baroque due to the extravagant lavish details. The central figure in the artwork is colossal Jupiter with radiant thunders encircling his head. He is seated on a throne, embellished with Eastern-style figurines and gem-like flora, and cradles frightened Semele, who bleeds and resembles a marble figurine. Above the deity, massive columns pierce the sky; below, various deities and fantastical creatures dwell. Adjacent to Jupiter’s throne, Moreau positioned an eagle, two struggling females, and a fawn, which would be identified later in the composition. Despite the evident symmetrical arrangement of the painting, its numerous components make it challenging to discern the predominant images.

Indeed, the central detail could be deemed Jupiter’s colossal body and countenance. He adorns myriad ornaments and jewels, as well as symbolic items from diverse cultures: for instance, Indian lotus and Egyptian scarab. These relics might symbolize the despotic nature of the heavens’ ruler, akin to that of the Eastern monarchs and Egyptian pharaohs. Furthermore, the stern and penetrating gaze, directed at the observer of the painting, showcases the determined nature of the deity. Thus, in Jupiter, Moreau portrayed the saturated divine essence, which is omnipotent and looming over humans.

Subsequently, Semele is accentuated by the pallid hue of her skin and attire; she is also a prominent detail. Her appearance contrasts with that of Jupiter: she is nearly unclothed, with only some fabric draping her leg. This portrayal symbolizes the vulnerability of humans before the deity, likely the Christian God, although Moreau employs symbols unrelated to Christianity. The infant Dionysus, who is delivered from Semele already, as indicated by the blood from her body, is frequently likened to Jesus. Hence, Semele’s direct encounter with the deity illustrates the incapacity of humans to grasp the divine due to the profound disparities between them.

Moreover, three figures capture the viewer’s attention: the two seated women and a half-man near Jupiter. From the left, the first woman is Death clutching a speared sword stained with blood and either concealing her face in shame or wiping tears with a fragment of her attire (Smith). Beside her, Pan with the hoofed legs dwells; he is another Greco-Roman deity and a symbol of dread. Lastly, the woman garbed in medieval attire and sporting a crown of thorns is Pain or Sorrow (Smith). These characters exemplify the enduring accompanying conditions of human existence. Thus, once again, the mortality, anguish, and distress of individuals are juxtaposed with the realm of God.

Finally, it is essential to delineate the significance of the depiction of the celestial realm and the infernal domain. The divine segment, enveloping Jupiter’s throne, is imbued with picturesque architecture, vegetation, and angelic figures inhabit it. Conversely, the lower part of the painting portrays, for instance, Hecate, who was a divine guardian of witches and sorcerers. Other winged or haloed deities and creatures are also present. This likely represents the human realm, replete with malevolence and enigmatic perils. This realm and the heavens intersect, signifying a connection between the divine and mortal.

Another theme portrayed in the piece and linked to the contrast between human and divine could be regeneration. Specifically, the demise of Semele followed by the birth of Dionysus symbolizes the perpetual cycle of life. Furthermore, Dionysus is also regarded as a deity, indicating that despite the vast disparities between the two realms, they remain connected and intertwined. Hence, regardless of how harsh and unsympathetic God may seem, he still influences the lives of people.

In conclusion, Gustave Moreau’s Jupiter and Semele is a intricate composition with a meaning that is not explicitly defined. However, this paper demonstrates that the predominant symbols and elements of the painting all contribute to highlighting the contrast between human and divine nature. Thus, Moreau’s interpretation of the ancient myth offers a completely new perspective from the original narrative, somewhat influenced by Christianity, albeit depicted with Eastern aesthetics.
