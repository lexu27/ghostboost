An indigenous person is an individual characterized as a descendant of native inhabitants of Australia. Before the arrival of Europeans, the native people of Australia occupied most of the land, which they shielded and fertilized to support cultivation. The indigenous people mainly practiced hunting and gathering as their source of livelihood before embracing agricultural practices. The native people arrived in Australia from Asia via Southeast Asia and have dwelled in the land between 45000 and 50000 years ago. After the arrival of European colonizers, the native people encountered many challenges such as economic, political, and disruption of their tradition. The indigenous people lost their culture, land, and family without considering the extermination of European imperialism policies; they became enslaved by the Europeans. During the colonial period, the native people faced a high rate of discrimination, resulting in displacement since the colonial powers occupied a large part of the fertile lands, resulting in many deaths of indigenous communities. For example, over 200 languages the indigenous people spoke lost value since the European colonizers did not acknowledge their culture. Many families were coerced out of their land, thus dispersing to other parts of Australia.
The offspring of the indigenous people should be acknowledged as one person since they share the bloodline, customs, and beliefs with their forebears, who lived over 50000 years ago in the land. Besides sharing cultural norms, the descendants can be classified as one people because they have a similar palace of origin: the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia, East Timor, Singapore, and Indonesia situated in the Southeast of Asia. Therefore, they deserve equal rights like any other community, enabling them to protect their culture and heritage as one person.
