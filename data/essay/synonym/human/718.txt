In order to comprehend the higher occurrence of diabetes within the county, it is crucial to observe both national and local patterns of the sickness. According to the CDC (2022), while new instances of diabetes have consistently decreased over the decades, the frequency of the illness among people aged below twenty has not. Similarly, the prevention and handling of diabetes among older adults is predominantly unsatisfactory and could be significantly enhanced. Several socio-cultural factors also impact the frequency of diabetes. For example, individuals with Hispanic backgrounds are more susceptible to have the condition. Other factors such as age, smoking, physical inactivity, and obesity among residents could also be affecting the visibility of diabetes.
Within the context of the county, it is probable that age, elevated hypertension, and Hispanic backgrounds are the primary risk factors for residents. While age and increased blood pressure are more usual risks for type 2 diabetes, the Hispanic background element may be a more recent development that is influenced by various social factors (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, n.d.).
While Hispanic individuals have a mild genetic predisposition to diabetes that may be impacted by traditional foods that are abundant in carbohydrates, absence of access to healthcare is the most notable risk factor. A study has discovered that health insurance disparities, low income, and lacking awareness of the condition among Hispanic individuals have contributed to an increase in instances of diabetes (Bauer, 2017). Therefore, the accumulated information implies that many individuals presently lack education and knowledge concerning preventive measures for diabetes. This would necessitate the establishment of suitable information regarding diabetes prevention and handling.
