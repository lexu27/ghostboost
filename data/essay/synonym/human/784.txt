The triumph of Phineas Taylor Barnum can be mainly credited to his skill as a advertising expert and the sensationalist essence of his products and services. In order to comprehend how his presentation could be executed in the contemporary era, it is crucial to evaluate the attractiveness of such an involvement and the primary components that enabled Barnum to effectively market it as a commodity to interested clients. From his gallery of oddities to his circus, Barnum would frequently incite curiosity among his audience. Consequently, a modern rendition of such an involvement would necessitate assertive advertising that is somewhat less straightforward, thereby generating mystery and curiosity among viewers (Foster, 2017). Likewise, Barnum prioritized a variety of characteristics within his advertising, including promoting to a vast demographic, enormous PR stunts, persistent advertising, and furnishing engaging stories.
Presuming this, a contemporary promotion of Barnum's establishments would incorporate distinct and continuous advertising through social media platforms. Due to the visually rich and experience-focused elements of his venture, video, audio, and visual content would also assist in promoting the involvement. Since Barnum had faith in reaching a broad demographic, it is probable that not only the advertising but the involvement itself could be presented digitally. In order to more effectively execute a successful plan, it can be advantageous to observe the methods in which modern circuses or experience-based businesses function. While numerous circuses persist in operating with a live audience, specific programs and businesses have discovered success in integrating live broadcast characteristics. This would be particularly advantageous for Barnum as he favors reaching a substantial customer base.
Although the capability to witness a presentation live through a television is not new, the availability of streaming platforms is a superior option for businesses. This is because an event-focused broadcast has no time limitations and has the freedom to insert advertising in desired time slots (Nichols, 2021). Essentially, this approach allows company executives to have full creative authority within their presentation of the involvement with the only limitation being the regulations of the streaming platform. Furthermore, the continuous flow of a live broadcast enables the narrative component that Barnum introduced in his previous advertising strategies.
In the present day, virtual exhibitions have become more widespread, often hosted through conference or other communication-centered software. This has been observed with sports education, magic shows, and a variety of other activities (Haslam, 2022). As such, Barnum's business blueprint could also profit from such an approach. It varies from a live broadcast by affording clients a closer and more intimate look at the performers and even potential interactive characteristics. Modern web design enables websites and advertising campaigns to have much greater interactivity and client involvement than before. This is an aspect that would probably be employed by Barnum due to his conviction that clients should be left with a sense that they had made a beneficial purchase.
Both approaches offer a variety of advantages and disadvantages. While a live broadcast provides content for a broad audience, it compromises on interaction with the audience. Conversely, a virtual show is likely to be more expensive and have a smaller customer base but provides a distinctive involvement that is likely to leave the audience content. It would even be plausible for Barnum to execute both approaches at different price levels. In conclusion, performative and experience-based services have potential within the realm of digital advertising.
