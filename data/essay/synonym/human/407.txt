This bag is ideal for mothers with adolescent children who are constantly on the move but desire to appear fashionable while running errands and engaging in family activities. It is upscale yet sturdy and keeps the owner’s personal items organized in a portable and secure manner, facilitating quick outdoor excursions.

Merchandise Selection
Per the survey data, among the target demographic, the most favored labels are Channel, Pucci, and Kate Shade. Consequently, the audience is conflicted between items where the excellence aligns with the cost and lavish products with exorbitant prices. To validate the premium cost, utilizing superior leather material and furnishing the purse with extra compartments for orderly storage could be beneficial, as most extravagant purses lack this attribute. Given that the survey outcomes indicate that the target demographic predominantly favors shoulder bags or totes, including an extra shoulder strap will present a more substantial rationale for the cost. The majority of survey respondents possess three to five purses, indicating a preference for a single bag suitable for all occasions, encompassing daily use, as opposed to a broad array of varied bags in diverse styles. Merging the accumulated findings points to the black bag choice in dimensions 9×11 crafted from leather with a production cost of 36$.

Pricing
The survey findings propose that most of the target demographic can manage prices ranging from 300$ to 700$, and a majority prefer online shopping for purses. Considering the audience’s earnings, it is probable that a purse with a high mid-range price will be more favored as its cost can be rationalized, unlike extravagant purse prices. The nearest substitute in the mid-range cost from All Tote Bags On Shelves research is Ralph Lauren Carlyle Mini Leather Zip Tote Bag with a pricing of 195$. Thus, setting the forthcoming product’s cost at approximately 250$ will result in a reasonable price for the customers for the quality of the products. The cost will also generate additional income for Buhi that the corporation can allocate to supplementary accessories and product packaging to establish a more deluxe ambiance.
