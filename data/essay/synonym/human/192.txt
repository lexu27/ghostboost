Preface
Descartes' philosophy is termed dualistic, indicating the parity of the material and the ideal but permitting the separate existence of these two phenomena. In one of his primary theses focused on exploring the interaction between the mind and body, the philosopher, while contrasting bodily and spiritual substances, discusses their opposition (Thibaut, 2018). Descartes examines what is veritable in the contents of the mind, in essence, in representations: ideas, emotions, and decisions. He discusses the absolute distinction between the mind and body, suggesting that the body is divisible and the mind is not because the operations of the latter cannot be accounted for by mechanical principles (Dika, 2020). In his elucidations, Descartes proposes a suitable resolution to the mind-body issue. The assertion that the link between the body and mind is an empirical reality evident to an individual in daily encounters is rational, and their disparity is distinctly established during philosophical contemplation.
The Issue and Resolution
In resolving the mind-body predicament, Descartes organizes the content of consciousness for lucidity and precision. Within the mind of a cogitative entity, aside from the concept of oneself, there exist notions about lifeless bodies, other living creatures, humans, and God. As per Dika (2020), self-perception is distinct and clear and, hence, authentic. Notions about other living beings can be derived from available encounters. Descartes assures the validity of the fundamental principle as clear and distinct knowledge by the existence of God, who has instilled the natural light of reason in humans (Dika, 2020). Self-awareness in Descartes is not self-contained but is open to God, functioning as a fount of the objective import of human thought.
This validation, which can be denoted as epistemic, is conclusive for the complete structure of the philosopher. As Urban (2018) posits, according to Descartes, the mind is a reflective entity, unextended, indivisible, capable of comprehending the truth and striving for it, and also endowed with complete free will. Conversely, the body is an extended and non-reflective entity; furthermore, it operates automatically (Urban, 2018). Consequently, Descartes contends that the human is truly distinct from the body and can exist autonomously from it. Theoretically, there can be no linkage between these two substances, but in actuality, a person is their inseparable amalgamation.
Cogito is Descartes' initial dependable judgment and, concurrently, the primary object directly presented to the mind â€“ a cogitative entity. It is accessible to individuals directly, while the existence of the other substance, material, is indirectly revealed (Urban, 2018). Descartes perceives a substance as an entity that necessitates nothing but itself to subsist. Scrutinizing this standpoint gives rise to the notion that only God can be denominated a substance. Amidst created entities, the philosopher conventionally labels substances only those that necessitate divine aid for their existence. The reflective entity as an attribute is unextended and, hence, indivisible. The entity of the body possesses an extension in length, width, and depth; hence, it is divisible into segments, has a form, motion, and a specific arrangement of parts. Solely these attributes are genuinely inherent in bodily substance, and all the rest, including hue, flavor, scent, warmth, and others, Descartes deems secondary. Such attributes derive their existence from the influence of primary qualities on the body.
Notions intrinsic in the reflective entity from the outset and not acquired through experience are innate. These encompass the notion of God as a wholly perfect being, the notions of quantities and shapes, as well as some universal concepts, or axioms (Macbeth, 2017). These everlasting truths embody the innate light of the mind. Consequently, Descartes delineates a clear demarcation between the notions of mind and body and advocates for distinct variances in their operations, which stands as a primary foundation of his theory of transcendental idealism. The notion of substantial or Cartesian dualism posited by him laid the groundwork for the philosopher's treatises, who substantiated his notions empirically.
Criticism Against Cartesian Substance Dualism and Descartes' Rebuttals
Despite his justification for dualism in the theory of body and mind, Descartes encountered objections from some other philosophers who rebuffed his notion. For instance, as quoted in Dong (2020), Thomas Hobbes contended that the essence of the identity between thought and thinking did not permit applying a similar interpretation algorithm to other occurrences or conditions. According to him, Descartes equates the subject and its capabilities, and solely a material subject is competent of thinking since thinking itself cannot think because this constitutes an endless paradox (Dong, 2020). To this, Descartes retorts that he perceives thinking precisely as a substance and not as an action, but this substance is spiritual and by no means material (Bardin, 2019).
Ultimately, as Dong (2020) observes, a substance is not apprehended directly but solely through its attribute, and if two substances possess distinct attributes, they should be segregated. A spiritual substance encompasses attributes such as cognition, desire, imagination, and some others, amalgamated under the label of thinking, while material substance comprises magnitude, form, and motion, united under the label of extension.
This is how Descartes responds to Hobbes' objection: if the attributes of two substances are entirely different, it is impracticable to blend these substances in thought. Otherwise, an individual contradicts the principle of clarity and precision in thought. Such a comprehension of the thinking substance allows room for liberty; as cited in Dong (2019), individuals grasp their mind independently from the body, which implies that consciousness and body are distinct. Furthermore, individuals grasp their volition as the aptitude of the soul to act and think freely, which implies that the will is truly autonomous. Moreover, solely the soul as a finite substance can possess free will since liberty exists where there is a choice, and a choice is present where there is something else outside the subject.
One of the most poignant contentions against Descartes' theory was articulated by Gilbert Ryle. He disputed the dualistic notion of the body and mind, asserting that it was founded on a categorical fallacy (Nnaemeka & Chukwunenye, 2018). Furthermore, as quoted in Christofidou (2018), in Ryle's perspective, behaviorism was a much more precise approach reflecting the motives of actions. The primary assertion was that, from a scientific perspective, physical action necessitated a physical cause.
Nonetheless, since, according to Descartes, the mind and body are entirely distinct entities, their interaction becomes implausible. For the progenitor of the dualism theory, there was no alternative rational method to counter these objections than to resort to the principle of divine intervention (Nnaemeka & Chukwunenye, 2018). Nonetheless, the concept of dualism did not garner full acknowledgment among all philosophers without exception, albeit Descartes' notions laid the groundwork for many cause-and-effect theories.
