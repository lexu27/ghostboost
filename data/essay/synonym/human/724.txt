Female with a Parasol – Madame Monet and Her Son is a artwork by the French artist Claude Monet, a pioneer and one of the most exceptional representatives of impressionism. Crafted in 1875, this painting became one of Monet’s most famous and influential pieces (Brodskaïa and Kalitina). The two individuals in the artwork are Monet’s spouse Camille and his child Jean.
The lower third of the painting displays a grassy area, and the other two-thirds encompass the figures of a lady and a young boy behind her. Monet’s spouse and child are the central points of the composition. The lower perspective enables observing the blue sky with white clouds behind the figures, which generates a distinctive lighting effect (Daily Dose of Art). Positioned at a distance from the woman, the boy’s figure also adds depth to the artwork; this compositional method directs the eye of the viewer diagonally downward, which was typical for several other works by Monet.
The utilization of colors and light in this artwork is truly remarkable. The sun is beaming on the figures from the background, casting a shadow. The brushstrokes are warm, vivid, and lively, blended with the subdued grays of the woman’s attire. It mirrors a whole array of colors around her: the blues of the sky, the yellow of the blossoms, and light, complementary strokes of purple (Joy of Museums Virtual Tours). Monet employs these colors and casual brush strokes to convey an ambiance of a windy summer day.
Female with a Parasol is a genre painting, which is a form of art that illustrates regular individuals and their daily activities. Hence, the painting gives the notion that the mother and son were disturbed during their everyday stroll in the meadow. It can be implied that the woman’s attire, veil, and parasol represent her status, and the grassy incline signifies the rural area that Monet favored over the urban centers and industry. All in all, the painting establishes a unique atmosphere of a transient memory captured in the moment.
