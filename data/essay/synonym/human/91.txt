Numerous issues regarding the recent modifications to the bail program have sparked intense discussions. The initial assertions suggested that the new stance would enable more compassionate and fair methods. Nonetheless, setting free various categories of defendants without any bail has resulted in a rise in the number of individuals who are rearrested on felony charges while still on release. Thus, a thorough examination is necessary to comprehend all the factors contributing to such significant outcomes. Furthermore, it is imperative to devise and establish the most effective framework for freeing individuals without bail. 

The bail adjustment is part of a sequence of criminal justice reforms that have been implemented in recent years. Under the new regulations, judges are prohibited from imposing financial bail. Additionally, judges were not afforded the chance to assess the potential danger that a defendant could present to a community. Simultaneously, according to Gold and Wright (2020), pretrial incarceration has substantial consequences and can jeopardize employment and housing. Therefore, the original rationale behind the initiation of the bail modification revolved around the inequity issues and discrepancies that permitted the affluent to purchase their liberty and go back home.

Currently, numerous individuals who have not yet been convicted of an offense are detained and awaiting trial. The overwhelming majority of them are from low-income neighborhoods and are unable to afford the required amount to spend time with their family, earn income, and adequately prepare for a trial. The destructive cycle engendered by such an approach enabled numerous activists and politicians to suggest an amendment intended to ameliorate the situation and combat bias. Koepke and Robinson (2018) argue that the current pretrial risk evaluation tools do not genuinely align with reformist objectives of reducing incarceration. Consequently, the evidence indicates that the new strategy, despite its positive impacts, empowered perpetrators to evade punishment and perpetuate disruptions to the usual rhythm of life in their communities.

Determining the appropriate resolution concerning the bail matter is challenging, as there are scarce alternative methods that can ensure a defendant's appearance in court to face allegations. Nevertheless, it has become evident that the bail adjustment unquestionably requires review. According to Baughman (2019), when executed correctly, bail prevents hazardous individuals from roaming freely; when handled poorly, it detains those with limited financial resources for longer periods. Given the recent economic ramifications, American society cannot tolerate the hazards associated with the outright abolition of the bail system. It is not advisable to release nearly every defendant at this juncture, considering the escalating involvement in criminal activities. There is a pressing need for alternatives to detention programs, but allowing social workers to conduct all the supervision instead of judges and enabling most offenders to return to the streets is not the optimal approach.

The security of society should remain a paramount concern for courts and law enforcement. Hence, it is vital to empower judges, not social workers, to determine whether an individual can be released. Introducing a consistent set of criteria that considers a person's prior history would be a crucial step forward. Furthermore, it is essential to differentiate between initial convictions and repeat offenses. Accordingly, I am optimistic about the future of bail reform. I trust that in this decade, the entire system will ensure that more compassionate conditions and methods will aid in liberating innocent defendants and rehabilitating criminals without the need to release the majority of defendants.
