Ethical relativism asserts that ethics is not founded on any absolute criterion. As per ethical relativism, moral truth is more likely to arise from circumstances, societies, and perceptions. The origin of ethical universalism is deemed to be human nature, specifically the vulnerability of an individual, the capacity to sympathize, and the ensuing necessity for debate for persuasion. The two ethical principles are in conflict, but ethical universalism appears to be more accurate.
Multiple arguments can be formulated regarding ethical relativism that mirror a uncertain nature. Initially, while many of the arguments that advocate for supporting relativism may appear convincing, they all possess a rational inconsistency in that they all lead back to the proper ethical framework that all individuals should adhere to, which constitutes ethical universalism. Secondly, relativists may contend that different cultures uphold different principles and that ethics are relative to various individuals. Nonetheless, these arguments elucidate people's behaviors in relation to definitive criteria, thus circling back to ethical universalism.
Ethical universalism assumes the presence of a moral structure that effectively governs the conduct of members of any society, irrespective of culture, race, gender, faith, nationality, sexual orientation, or any other distinct attributes. The most straightforward validation for this perspective is the evident observation that in all recognized moral doctrines that have demonstrated their effectiveness, there exists a shared essence: reverence for life, well-being, possessions, and personal honor. Ethical universalism appears to be the more credible hypothesis. Initially, ethical relativism is based on exemptions, not on general principles. All individuals approach ethics through human nature, which accounts for almost identical moral and ethical standards across all nations and peoples. Moral standards are deemed fundamental universally, such as the prohibition of homicide. Secondly, if each person possessed their distinct moral code and ethics, as ethical relativism implies, it would be impracticable to regulate human interactions.
