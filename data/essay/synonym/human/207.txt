Geographical distribution and position
Banana is a well-liked fruit crop that thrives worldwide and offers various health benefits. Bananas are especially important in numerous low-income, food-insecure, underdeveloped countries, where they can aid in both household food security and income generation as a cash crop. The crop is a crucial export product for several agricultural countries, and it is the most substantial fruit crop in Africa's, Asia's, and Latin America's production and trade (MacKinnon & Cumbers, 2019). Bananas from Central and South America, as well as the Philippines, make up more than 90% of all exports (MacKinnon & Cumbers, 2019). The EU, the USA, China, Russia, and Japan are the leading importers (MacKinnon & Cumbers, 2019). Global banana production is estimated to be 130 million tons annually (MacKinnon & Cumbers, 2019). About 87 percent of bananas produced worldwide are either consumed by farmers or vended in local markets. Nearly a third of it is cultivated in Sub-Saharan Africa, where it fulfills over 25% of the nutritional energy needs of more than 100 million people (MacKinnon & Cumbers, 2019). East Africa is the primary producer and consumer of bananas in Africa.
Spatial Dispersion
Significant supply growth in primary exporting countries Ecuador and the Philippines, along with substantial increases in import demand, particularly from China and the European Union, are fundamental drivers of trade (MacKinnon & Cumbers, 2019). Prominent retail chains from key importing countries are now directly involved in the global banana value chain. These networks purchase bananas straight from producers and suppliers rather than through traditional fruit companies (MacKinnon & Cumbers, 2019). The complex network of interactions entailed in the production, distribution, and trade of any specific commodity could lead to real conflicts of interest among groups of people regarding who gains the most from a product. Low-cost bananas are often handed down to small farmers and plantation workers along the supply chain, resulting in reduced wages and labor conditions (MacKinnon & Cumbers, 2019). Presently, the primary concern regarding spatial distribution is that extensive banana cultivation might have adverse effects on the environment, worker well-being, and local communities. This is due to the frequently stringent methods used to control irrigation and plant ailments.
