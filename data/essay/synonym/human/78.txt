It is crucial to observe that it is highly typical for one culture not to be able to comprehend the condition, internal conflicts, and complexities of a different culture. The provided concept is known as ethnocentrism, where one’s standpoint and opinions are focused around his or her own culture. For instance, the book mentions: “individuals in America don’t understand, but when an American franchise opens in a third-world country, individuals go wild” (Noah 188). As an individual residing in Canada, I embody Canadian culture, where most individuals from developing nations might not completely grasp that a simple fast-food restaurant chain is not such an exciting event for regular consumers. The book also mentions that “Westerners are taken aback and puzzled by that, but it’s a situation of the West reaping what it has sown. The colonial powers carved Africa, employed the black man, and did not properly educate him” (Noah 194). Likewise, many presume that Canadian individuals are overly courteous as part of the culture, but I would like others to understand that it is not the situation.
One of the most fascinating facets of the book is how certain despots are not recognized as such in other locations due to the absence of their significance, which is why it holds true for current leaders in Canada as well. The text mentions: “so in Europe and America, yes, Hitler is the Greatest Madman in History, In Africa, he’s just another strongman from history books” (Noah 196). Although Canada did not have such despots, many individuals outside Canada perceive that our leaders are flawless and emblematic of true democracy. However, it is not always accurate because they also encounter struggles for power and do not always act in the nation’s best interests, which are becoming more visible in recent occurrences.
