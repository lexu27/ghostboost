The ten captivating occurrences in my community are church building, establishment of radio stations, intra families soccer contests, building, and establishment of healthcare facilities, and events like burials and weddings. The other two crucial happenings are church christening actions and wrestling contests among young boys between 10 to 17 years old. Out of the six topics, I am unfamiliar with intra families soccer contests, but I consider it as the most thrilling occurrence.
Intra families' contest is the most fascinating happening in my community. Seven families unite to create a team of seven players. This contest is usually arranged by the community authorities with the aim of nurturing talents and also forging a brighter future for the young individuals. The contest only involves youths from 18 to 30 years old. One of the authorities explained that this initiative is solely for the youths who are in search of self-discovery. These contests are conducted during the school breaks between December and January.
Regarding this captivating and significant happening, I had already learned a few things. I am aware that this contest initiative is sponsored by The Association for Talent Development. Similarly, this initiative offers job opportunities for young people; three of my relatives are currently employed by the American Federation of Women. On the other hand, one thing I may wish to understand is how the pandemic impacted event plans and the challenges they encountered during the pandemic.
Talent recognition and job creation render this happening captivating as it aids in combating unemployment among the youth. In a conversation with Mr. Bowers, the head of the grand community event, Mr. Bowers elucidated that the COVID-19 pandemic regulations enforced by the state disrupted the event arrangements. These COVID-19 pandemic regulations comprised lockdowns, curfews, and social distancing. Lockdowns hindered the events, financiers, and sponsors from participating in soccer practice, while curfews reduced soccer training durations. Conversely, social distancing prohibited the full soccer teams from practicing, thereby diminishing the efficiency of those teams. Apart from financial obstacles, Mr. Bowers also noted the deficiency of expansive fields to accommodate all players in adherence to the state's COVID-19 social distancing policy.
According to my personal investigation, I discovered that COVID-19 indeed interrupted the event proceedings and plans. Upon viewing the recent videos displayed by Mr. Bowers in his office, it was apparent that instead of 14 players, the field could only accommodate eight players. Comparing the past and present soccer training sessions, there was a disparity in audience size. This had a detrimental effect on supporting talent and job creation since the audience comprised event sponsors who were unable to attend to identify talented individuals. The documented soccer game in 2019 was much superior to that of 2020 and 2021. During these two years, the players lacked adequate space and time to train as a complete team, resulting in subpar performance. The subpar performance due to inadequate training has also induced the sponsors to be hesitant in supporting the event.
Based on my evaluation, the COVID-19 pandemic impacted the intra families soccer competition, the most crucial and captivating happening in my community. This event has been captivating as it displays remarkable soccer talent among the youth and is essential because it generates employment for the young individuals. Through my examination of the preceding and current recorded videos, COVID-19 regulations by the state have negatively affected the event. Social distancing has hindered the entire team from training collectively; lockdowns have prevented sponsors from traveling to physically witness and recognize talents, while curfews have restricted the training periods. Mr. Bowers's metaphorical language genuinely exposed how distressing the pandemic has been for the event. From my perspective, Mr. Bowers should approach the national government to authorize them to conduct the intra families' contests regardless of the pandemic regulations enforced by the state. He should do this because this event has provided jobs for the youth and generated revenue for the government.
