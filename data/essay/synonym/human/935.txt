Tiredness is a common and incapacitating sign linked to a number of sudden and persistent conditions such as persistent heart failure and sudden heart attack. Tiredness has not been examined concerning patients with steady coronary heart disease (CHD), notwithstanding the fact that it might contribute to new occurrences or advancement of CHD. Consequently, Eckhardt et al. (2014) determined that it was crucial to establish the intensity of tiredness and its qualities in a steady CHD population. There were three primary intentions of the research conducted by these researchers, one of which was to depict tiredness in steady CHD patients. Furthermore, Eckhardt et al. (2014) aimed to determine whether specific demographic, physiological, or psychological variables were associated with tiredness. Ultimately, they aimed at recognizing whether tiredness was linked to health-related quality of life.
Five individuals are cited as the authors of the research: Ann L. Eckhardt, Holli A. DeVon, Mariann R. Piano, Catherine J. Ryan, and Julie J. Zerwic. All of them have the qualifications of PhD and RN. Ann L. Eckhardt is connected with School of Nursing at Illinois Wesleyan University in Bloomington where she holds the role of Assistant Professor. The other four researchers are connected with Department of Biobehavioral Health Science, College of Nursing at University of Illinois in Chicago. Holli A. DeVon is Associate Professor, Mariann R. Piano is Professor and Department Head, Catherine J. Ryan is Clinical Assistant Professor, and Julie J. Zerwic is Professor and Executive Associate Dean there.
With regards to the operational definition of tiredness, it was defined by the researchers as the subjective feeling of extreme and continuous exhaustion, weariness, and energy deprivation. Conceptually, tiredness was equated to pain based on its multidimensionality, exposure to physical and psychosocial factors, and presence of common characteristics with some mood and anxiety disorders. Additionally, it was noted that in CHD patients, tiredness is a prevalent sign related to weakness, reduced physical activity, and poor life quality.
The research employed a partially mixed sequential dominant status research design. According to Eckhardt et al. (2014), in their work, the primary design of the research was quantitative, followed by a qualitative component. This mixed-method framework was chosen to ensure complementarity, which aims at attaining convergence of quantitative and qualitative results and offering descriptive depth with the aid of qualitative interviews. First came the collection of the cross-sectional quantitative data, after which participants were chosen from this sample for the qualitative component. Qualitative and quantitative data were merged at the stages of data analysis and discussion.
Statistical analysis of data occurred with quantitative elements; the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences was used for it. Eckhardt et al. (2014) report that a nominal alpha level of <.05 was chosen for the outcomes to be statistically significant. For the analysis of demographic data and tiredness distinguished by gender, Chi-squared independence tests and independent samples t tests were utilized. The identification of factors linked to tiredness was carried out with the utilization of Pearson’s correlation and Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient. Predictors of tiredness were ascertained with the utilization of multiple regression.
One hundred and two patients with steady CHD were the participants of this research. Eckhardt et al. (2014) enrolled them during routine medical appointments from two cardiology clinics. One clinic mainly served urban minority patients (n = 51), and the other mainly served Caucasian patients from a small rural town (n = 51). Eligibility was determined by the examination of medical records. Inclusion criteria involved a steady CHD diagnosis, the ability to speak and read English, and independent living. Exclusion criteria involved heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, coronary artery bypass grafting or heart attack in the prior 2 months, and incurable disease with prognosis to live for less than 6 months. In addition to that, patients with symptoms related to worsened or exacerbated cardiac disease, unstable angina, and hemodialysis were excluded from participation. Such exclusion criteria were due to the elimination of patients with a recent acute episode, new or worsening CHD symptoms, and co-occurring conditions known to be related to significant tiredness. The institutional review boards of both unspecified sites approved the research, and all participants provided their written informed consent.
Regarding variables, the independent ones were various demographic (gender, age, race, employment), physiological (heart attack, hypertension, diabetes), and psychological (depressive symptoms) factors. The dependent variable was the correlation of tiredness interference and intensity with the independent variables. Eckhardt et al. (2014) used the term ‘variables’ concerning the independent ones; however, there was no mention of variables being independent or dependent. One specific relationship that was being examined by the authors of the research was this between tiredness and depressive symptoms. Eckhardt et al. (2014) discovered that the occurrence of depressive symptoms was the sole predictor of interference and intensity of tiredness among the potential tiredness contributors. This was a non-experimental research because it occurred in real-life settings, and the researchers controlled neither the environment nor the variables. Finally, there were no interventions, which means that no alterations were made in a research in order to study the outcomes.
This research is pertinent to the actual practice of nursing due to it providing data about tiredness in steady CHD patients, which has not been done before. Therefore, specialists are able to learn more about this phenomenon and start developing strategies to facilitate the lives of people with steady CHD struggling with the condition. Eckhardt et al. (2014) provided all basic information in their research’s abstract, and divided it into sections for it to be easier perceived. The abstract speaks about background, objectives, methods, results, and discussion, and lists key words. From my perspective, the research must have taken several months to be completed. I arrived at that conclusion having taken into account the participant sample and the fact that the data gathered from questionnaires, inventories, and interviews had to be analyzed and systematized. If I could ask the authors a question about their research, I would ask them what they believe the best solution based on the research’s outcomes could be.
In conclusion, Eckhardt et al. (2014) conducted their research to explore tiredness in individuals with steady CHD. The researchers enrolled one hundred and two participants from two unspecified cardiology clinics and employed a partially mixed sequential dominant status design. This work is a significant contribution to the understanding of the phenomenon of tiredness in steady CHD patients. Further research is required to explore the effectiveness of various interventions to facilitate the lives of individuals struggling with the issue and enhance their health-related quality of life.
