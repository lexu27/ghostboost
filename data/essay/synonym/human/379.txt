John Smeaton was an English engineer who devised bridges, waterways, and beacons. In the provided article, authored by Andrew M. A. Morris, the writer illustrates how this celebrated engineer utilized parameter alteration in a much broader context as part of an analytical process (Morris, 2021). Morris emphasizes the three distinct objectives of such a procedure, comprising optimization, theory experimentation, and maxim evolution through exploratory testing. As the author articulates, the core premise of this research is that Smeaton achieved more than improved engineering methodologies by systematizing previous artisanal practices, as was the customary interpretation of Smeaton’s technique set by technology analysts in the 1990s (Morris, 2021). Instead, he argues that his approach establishes a connection between science and technology by encompassing both theory experimentation and practical experimentation (Morris, 2021). I concur with the writer and assert that John Smeaton excelled at conducting the conventionally observed hypothesis experimentation and formulated empirical regularities through exploratory trials. While some academics may argue that Smeaton's work lacked scientific research, the engineer underwent a thorough scrutiny and formulated his own principles. Morris also deliberated on the correlation between science and technology during the Industrial Revolution. According to Morris, the conventional comprehension of this was shaped by two nearly outdated historical investigations, which are mirrored in the discourse between A.E. Musson, and Eric Robinson, and A. Rupert Hall (Morris, 2021). According to the initial duo of researchers, science was a vital element of the industrial Era (Morris, 2021). Hall, on the other hand, opines that the 18th-century technical innovations contributed almost insignificantly to the era’s science. From my perspective, Hall’s viewpoint lacks a firm foundation. The Industrial Revolution, in my view, was a fusion of technology, science, and industry. Noteworthy advancements and technical progressions influenced practically every existing aspect of human lives while also introducing a plethora of new ones. It is widely recognized that during the early phases of the Revolution, natural energy sources, such as wind and water, were utilized to produce power. However, subsequently, novel technologies, including steam power, were explored and enhanced by John Smeaton, and electricity played a crucial role in facilitating the Industrial Revolution to prosper.
