In the instance study, a subjective part of the note offers a distinct image of the patient’s physique, grievances, and medical history. However, it requires specification about the most recent instance the patient engaged in unprotected sexual activity as it can help determine the time between exposure and onset of symptoms. The existence of comparable skin irregularities on the patient's current sexual companions and the prior presence of akin skin abnormalities on the patient's skin and mucous membranes can establish the duration of the illness and the number of occurrences. The emergence of widespread rash all over the patient's body can suggest the duration and stage of the illness. The usage of any medications, including antimicrobials, in the past month, can impact subsequent diagnostic procedures, strategies, and treatment courses; indicating fixed drug reaction. The patient's medical history lacks gynecological interrogation concerning menstrual specifics, pregnancies and terminations, and pregnancy prevention. It is also crucial to specify the patient's travel past for distinguishing between chancroid, lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV), and granuloma inguinale (Afzal, 2020).
The factual notes should predominantly encompass physical assessment like examination of the lymph nodes since one of the notable indicators of initial syphilis is localized lymphadenitis, and secondary syphilis presents with extensive lymphadenopathy. The evaluation of the skin and mucous membranes in the anal region, periorbital region, oral mucosa, and vaginal examination is also necessary. Multiple sores may appear if several sexual interactions with the infected partner during the recipient's incubation period occurred or if various points of bacterial infiltration happened during one sexual act. A thorough examination of oral mucosa can suggest Behçet disease if the mouth ulcers are distressing and correspond with eye inflammation, skin lesions, muscle and joint discomfort, and stomach symptoms.
The diagnostic assays should involve screenings for syphilis (VDRL in conjunction with darkfield microscopy or direct fluorescent antibody test), polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for HSV, DNA amplification tests for chancroid, and LGV (Roett, 2020). The last step in the diagnostic pursuit, if prior screenings are negative, should be a histologic examination of a tissue biopsy searching for Donovan bodies unique to granuloma inguinale (Kang et al., 2019).
The assessment is mainly supported by factual evidence as test outcomes are the most reliable. A subset of individuals with sexually transmitted diseases has peculiarities in providing erroneous information to the physician, and their medical history should be critically assessed. Syphilis is a fitting diagnosis for this instance, and test findings can validate or refute it. It is crucial for every healthcare practitioner to be vigilant about syphilis; despite not being widespread, the effects on all body systems and organs are severe. Syphilis is an age-old ailment; yet, contemporary medicine lacks awareness in diagnosing it as it might, for instance, imitate other oral indications (Dybeck Udd & Lund, 2016). As an alternative diagnosis, HSV infection can be considered, and the differential exploration for it will show grouped blisters on a reddened base, leading to shallow sores (Vestergaard, 2018) subsequently. Chancroid, or soft chancre, is triggered by Haemophilus ducreyi, is prevalent in Africa and Asia, has an incubation period from 24 hours to 15 days, and presents a painful ulcer situated unilaterally (Agharbi, 2019).
Lymphogranuloma venereum is caused by L-serovars of chlamydia trachomatis and is prevalent in endemic areas of Africa, South-Eastern Asia, South, and Central America, exhibiting inguinal and anorectal symptoms (Kand et al., 2019). Granuloma inguinale is induced by Klebsiella granulomatis and is endemic in South Africa, India, South China, and Brasilia, with ulcers tending to gradually expand and having elevated rolled edges (Afzal, 2020). Behçet disease can also be contemplated for differential diagnosis though it is an infrequent multisystemic disorder involving various organs in the pathological process. The clinical presentation is notable with painful and deep oral and genital ulcers, eye inflammation, and occasionally gastrointestinal, muscular, and joint involvement (Davatchi et al., 2017). Syphilis lesions are seldom painful, exhibit a range of skin components, notably in the secondary stage, and the primary sore has a characteristic hardening at the base (Kang et al., 2019).
