Preamble
Globalization has had an immense influence on the global economy, impacting the expansion of geographical mobility of the labor force in particular. Large populations change their living environment, settlement type, and field of operation within relatively brief time spans. Simultaneously, they find themselves in a fresh, unfamiliar setting, surrounded by individuals who have a distinct lifestyle, a different set of secular and religious principles, and speak a different language. The rise in both the absolute and relative proportions of diasporas results, correspondingly, in an escalation of their absolute and relative contributions to the economy. This study views the diaspora as a crucial entity in the economic processes of our era. Economic activities concerning the diaspora progress in alignment with broader ethnic, social, and economic currents of contemporary times.

Background
Diasporas, as entities in the cultural and historical evolution, are as ancient as ethnic groups and religious communities themselves. This can be inferred from the most ancient written sources and ethnographic data about ethnic groups with pre-state social structures. The demographic structure of diasporas may serve as a prerequisite for economic leadership (Welde et al., 2020). The most well-known genesis of diasporas is their emergence through relocation from their native land. The migration flow is predominantly dominated by male individuals in their working years, possessing an above-average level of education and vocational training, typically being energetic and resourceful (Stone & Scott, 2018). Consequently, migrants exhibit higher economic engagement compared to the average characteristics of the initial community. 

This phenomenon partly emerges spontaneously and partly under intentional state control aimed at managing the influx or restriction of specific migrant categories. Many states engaged in recruitment or, conversely, imposed restrictive quotas based on the age, profession, wealth, etc., of migrants (Koinova, 2018a). As an outcome of this spontaneous or deliberate selection, the economic significance of diasporas might surpass the average level within the surrounding society (Seraphin et al., 2019). This is manifested notably in the standard of living, which can notably surpass that of the homeland.

Key Scholars and Theoretical Frameworks
The extent of diasporas’ impact on the economic advancement of host and origin countries stands as a prominent issue for many researchers. The theoretical frameworks concerning this topic encompass various aspects of the issue. These encompass the employment and unity of migrant laborers, as well as the influence of migration on the socio-economic progress of nations (Carment & Calleja, 2018). Scholars in their studies tackle diverse, sometimes contradictory facets of the involvement of diasporas, migrant laborers, remittances, and human capital in economic growth.

The theoretical framework is interlinked with global processes, local culture interaction, and the formation of fresh socio-cultural identities. In the 1990s, a novel research direction emerged – the transnational approach. Notable contributions include the works of the American sociologist Peggy Levitt, who has frequently collaborated with Glick-Schiller on issues concerning the theory and methodology of the transnational approach (Levitt & Schiller, 2004). She is a key figure in the sociological exploration of the transnational phenomenon. Additionally, Levitt is recognized for introducing the concept of transnational diasporal corporations into scholarly discourse.

The concept of “transnational social space,” introduced by the aforementioned scholars, sparked criticisms from sociologists. Waldinger (2017) further developed the theory by critiquing the limits of transnationalism. He deems it methodologically incorrect to view a nation-state devoid of any territorial link (Waldinger, 2017). Nevertheless, Waldinger appreciates the idea of social interactions across diasporas and territorial boundaries. However, he suggests replacing the term “transnational social space” with “deterritorialized national state”(Waldinger, 2017). His rationale lies in the engagement of diasporas in the state market, leading to the establishment of enduring international economic interactions.

Conclusion
The trends and characteristics of the largest diasporas from Nigeria were identified in this paper. It was determined that diasporas are heterogeneous and intricate to study, especially in contemporary settings. The paper evaluated the influence of the Nigerian diaspora on host countries' policies, foreign policy, and the economic trajectory of the homeland. A significant body of literature delves into various facets of Nigerian diaspora life. The bedrock of its existence – labor activity – has been extensively examined.

Overall, the diaspora’s impact on the Nigerian economy cannot be definitively assessed. Their actions do not substantially contribute to fundamental indicators like GDP, exports, and average population incomes. The remittance of savings by Nigerians to their homeland does not foster economic development. The influence of Nigerian diasporas on the economic progress of sending and receiving nations is relatively modest. Capital, labor, and entrepreneurial skills of Nigerian diaspora members do not constitute a major component of these countries’ economies.

Remittances to the homeland, although crucial in the global economy, represent a marginal segment of the Nigerian economy. The country's economic growth is primarily propelled by foreign direct investment. The mobilization of the diaspora for financial aid to the homeland demonstrates lower efficiency compared to other methods. Additionally, the outflow of labor capital to other nations raises concerns among local ethnic groups.
