Russia Nowadays (RT) is widely recognized for its contentious reporting on various subjects, particularly news in Ukraine. Multiple sources have frequently accused it of spreading distorted information that shapes a specific viewpoint. In many aspects, it is determined by the principles that are set forth in it in Russia and which, through the operations of RT, are also endorsed abroad. In such a circumstance, one can infer that freedom of the press is not only at risk but virtually non-existent, being engulfed by political rhetoric. The objective of this document is to scrutinize the situation with RT coverage of news about Ukraine through the perspective of the Hutchins report on a free and responsible press.
As Hutchins highlights in his report, there are three hazards for news publishers and other media channels. First and foremost, the robust expansion of such mechanisms diminishes the number of individuals who can express their will and disseminate their viewpoint. This aspect is manifested in the ongoing RT actions as only specialized individuals can upload news on their platforms. Functioning as one of the most extensive pro-Russian voices, RT stifles all other viewpoints, limiting freedom of expression. The second aspect, as per Hutchins, is the failure to deliver the news that society requires, despite having the capability. RT presents news about Ukraine in an extremely biased manner, extolling Russia and consistently highlighting the shortcomings of Ukraine, portraying it negatively. While individuals anticipate impartiality from the news, RT utilizes its extensive resources for propaganda. Lastly, the third aspect is the utilization by press administrators of techniques censured by society. RT actively distorts the truth, portraying it in a manner favorable to itself, which is a censured practice unworthy of the press.
As per Hutchins, governmental oversight of the press signifies the loss of a primary safeguard against totalitarianism. In the context of RT and its coverage of news about Ukraine, it can be observed that this media instrument serves as a direct means for disseminating propaganda. All the perils to the free press delineated by Hutchins can be emphasized in the operations of this organization, implying its inadequacy as a trustworthy source of information. Consequently, applying this report to the scenario with RT and Ukraine, it can be deduced that this news outlet is not part of the free and responsible ones but endorses a distinct political stance supported by the Russian government.
