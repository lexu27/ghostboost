Sociology regards social layers constructed based on the standards of ethnicity, era, learning, and, primarily, financial status. It is precisely the layers determined by the financial position that are most deeply rooted in contemporary sociology. Nevertheless, in my view, examinations on the subject of social layers by ethnicity and healthcare are the most captivating and responsive to the requirements of society. Sociology illustrates the potential reasons for the appearance of social occurrences, including disparity. Owing to the connection of specific incidents or qualities that sociologists document in their research, individuals can perceive these causes. 

These connections establish the foundation for producing graphs mirroring statistical and demographic research. Dependent on the results acquired, it becomes feasible at one time to make sociological predictions, encompassing those linked to public health. By possessing comprehensive data about public health and inequality in this domain, it is viable in the future to establish a distinct way of life, taking into consideration education and potential employment. 

For instance, sociologists identify a correlation between the degree of education acquired in youth and potential ailments in adulthood and old age. I would also highlight the particulars of education itself in correlation with the traits of illnesses. Individuals educated in coding or cybersecurity will not encounter the same health issues as those educated in music. Even if these individuals at the age of 20, during their education, display the same health indicators and (and) have similar grievances, the distinction will be noticeable in the future. At the age of 20, the likelihood of the same conditions, particularly for the specialists in question, is minimal since the musical education received by a teenager in school rapidly distorts the physique. 

Individuals can make similar comparisons with fields such as archaeology and bookkeeping, industrial chemistry, and psychology. In their investigation, Adler and Ostrove (1999) validate this: "We discover impacts of learning gained through young adulthood on health issues that arise many years later, suggesting that educational accomplishment determines later health" (p. 8). By selecting one or a specialization, an individual determines what role they will undertake in society, what resources they will possess, and what illnesses they will be more vulnerable to. 

Sociological analysis also determines which, for instance, kinds of cancer are more usual for lower financial strata. Adler and Ostove (1999) portray it this way: "Research in Canada unveils that the linkage of SES with survival is strongest for cancers of the head and neck region, uterus and cervix, and bladder. These are cancers in which local symptoms frequently precede the development of metastatic disease and allow early treatment" (p. 9). Individuals with low social standing are less inclined to consult a physician, self-medicate more frequently, and seek guidance from their acquaintances and friends. They seldom undergo screenings, and sometimes the screenings they can afford monetarily or live in a small town are not of high quality. 

That is how sociology can draw connections and parallels and formulate predictions. It supports individuals in making informed choices that influence their entire lives. By examining the medical applications of individuals with high and low social status and establishing extensive databases, contemporary sociologists can explain current tendencies in the healthcare sector. However, not solely financial status as such influences health. An essential aspect that partially impacts financial status is the ecology of the region where individuals reside. I wish to address this topic separately since environmental concerns now occupy one of the primary positions in financial research. Suppose individuals can manage to reside in environmentally safe regions while not having an elevated level of education or possessing a minimal range of work skills. In that case, their health, overall, will not decline swiftly. In contrast, individuals (with high status) residing in contaminated cities may experience illnesses that are not characteristic of their class and environment. Most individuals with high financial status have opportunities to travel and relocate from city to city or nation to nation. Climate change usually has a favorable effect on their endurance and health.
