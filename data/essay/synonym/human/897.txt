Social conduct is a combination of behavioral patterns characteristic of the majority of society at a specific time. There are multiple kinds of them, but they all exhibit a lack of definite structure, even when deliberately organized movements. This is a result of various influences among all members of any social movement. If they are not guided by some external or internal motivational power, like political determination or finances, which coordinate them, they are prone to disband eventually. The expansion of the Internet and social media brings about extensive transformations in the establishment, structure, and dissolution of social movements, enabling much swifter information exchange.
Social movements are diverse, and social media directly impacts them all. Unregulated movements are sparked by changes in the world that are impactful for individuals: for instance, financial downturns, conflicts, or even certain speculations about significant occurrences. Such speculations may even be false: a notable instance was the situation involving Sony and Apple in 2010. There was a plethora of posts on Facebook and other social platforms about theoretical intentions of Apple to purchase Sony. They were unfounded but resulted in a surge in Sony's share value, illustrating how quickly social conduct can alter under intense incentives and due to rapid dissemination.
Hence, it is evident that social media has simplified the formation and dissolution of social movements. They enhance the exchange of information, thereby ensuring that all incidents can be quickly known by many individuals through social media updates, online articles, and blogs. Consequently, a social movement, arising in reaction to a stimulus like speculations about a major corporation, will materialize instantly, and its outcomes will unfold swiftly as well.
