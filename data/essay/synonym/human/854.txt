In the contemporary world, gesture and facial expressions are equally crucial as oral communication, which is why such significant importance is given to their interpretation. In her TED speech, Lynne Franklin specifies that one’s movements represent the way in which people think, see, and feel (TEDx Talks, 2017). Consequently, she distinguishes three body language models: a looker, listener, and toucher. The primary category comprises roughly 75% of the world’s population and assumes that an individual thinks in pictures and images (TEDx Talks, 2017). Such a way of thinking is manifested in their requirement for constant eye contact. The second model is a listener, which is embodied by 20% of the population (TEDx Talks, 2017). This presupposes that a person uses auditory information while articulating concepts and objects. These individuals tend to gaze downwards, murmur, or tap the pen on the table while speaking. Ultimately, only the remaining 5% are touchers who think in emotions (TEDx Talks, 2017). They establish connections based on touch; thus, they enjoy embracing or unintentionally patting someone while conversing. Consequently, body language remains a predominant element of daily communication despite the majority focusing on the spoken aspect.

The term “body language” is commonly perceived as symbolic fragments of motions of various body parts and stances. They aid in understanding how people's thoughts are organized, framed, and encoded, along with their emotions, sentiments, and notions. Body language can also encompass unfamiliar motions such as postures, stride, foot and head gestures, facial expressions, and others (Andersson, 2018). Body language has been scrutinized for almost numerous centuries now, commencing from Charles Darwin’s research dedicated to studying bodily movements (Canderan et al., 2020). Holding a significant place in cultural history, it is a subject of investigation in rhetoric, medicine, psychology, pedagogy, art, and other fields. Consequently, the examination of body language is supported by various facets.

Presently, body language is being explored in various scientific domains. Psycholinguists and psychologists delve into this concept further to track someone’s behavioral trends. It is of notable interest to examine how a person behaves in specific situations. For example, body gestures are extensively explored in educational contexts. Importantly, language instructors become the objects of experiments since it is intriguing to understand how they gesture while teaching a new language (Andersson, 2018). As body language is an emerging area, its exploration is anticipated to broaden in the future. This is driven by the increasing curiosity of researchers in human development from infancy.

Arguably, the most captivating part of Franklin’s discourse was the concluding segment where she urged the audience to recall the most memorable event to identify which body language model they utilized. It was astonishing to discover that individuals project their thought processes in conversations with others, sometimes leading to discrepancies. In everyday interactions, individuals must consider their conversational partner’s body language to establish effective rapport.

Lynne Franklin is a global speaker who presents a lecture on the brain’s capacities. She is a neuroscience and business communication investigator who examines the tactics of successful persuasive discussions. Franklin emphasizes brain activity as a foundation for establishing rapport with anyone without resorting to manipulative tactics (TEDx Talks, 2017). Throughout her career, she has collaborated with numerous organizations to enhance performance and profits. Additionally, she serves as a trusted consultant to multiple CEOs nationwide. Her communication approach is grounded in personal experience and scientific knowledge. Hence, in her presentation, she utilized numerical data to substantiate the researchers’ discoveries (TEDx Talks, 2017). Furthermore, she employed qualitative data, a collection of facts to elucidate and exemplify the body language models. Broadly, Franklin operates in the psychology of communication, which examines an individual’s mechanisms for fostering relationships with others.

Cognitive and behavioral psychological viewpoints align with the study of body language, elucidating the notions these fields are dedicated to. For instance, the cognitive perspective delves into the cognitive processes of the human and animal mind. It explores and investigates processes such as attention, memory, imagination, perception, speech, logical thinking, problem-solving approaches, human and artificial intelligence (Andersson, 2018). Conversely, the behavioral standpoint focuses on human reactions conveyed through language, actions, and bodily motions. Thus, these domains are closely linked to the study of body language.

If one were to inquire Lynne Franklin about the subject, it would be intriguing to learn more about the gestures and eye movements individuals employ to appear more self-assured. Additionally, exploring persuasion as a facet of nonverbal behavior would be insightful. Lastly, understanding physiognomy, which examines facial expressions, is essential as it plays a significant role in everyday communication.

In conclusion, body language is a multifaceted scientific area influenced by numerous societal factors. It garners considerable interest as psychologists and other scientists delve into researching human behavior. Lynne Franklin’s talk was enlightening in terms of the qualitative and quantitative data presented on the body language models. Cognitive and behavioral psychological perspectives are deeply engaged in exploring this phenomenon.
