The Crimean Conflict of 1853-56 was the initial significant military clash in Europe following the Napoleonic Wars and, consequently, often intrigued historians' interest. Fought between Russia and a union of European forces along with the Ottoman Empire, the dispute showcased substantial progressions in technology, communication, and the art of combat. As the title implies, a critical aspect of the conflict was the operation fought in the Crimean peninsula between the defending Russians and the expeditionary unit of British, French, Ottoman, and subsequently Sardinian troops. The most renowned incidents of the war, such as the Charge of the Light Brigade, were linked with the blockade of the Russian naval station in Sevastopol. Nevertheless, this siege would have been unattainable if not for the allied triumph in the primary significant battle of the Crimean operation. The struggle of Alma, fought on 20 September 1854, initiated the route to Sevastopol and established the supremacy of the allied arms and the French strategies over the unwieldy Russian military.
Before examining the battle itself, it is vital to fleetingly address its context. In 1852-1853 a seemingly trivial disagreement between the Orthodox and Catholic clergy in Palestine escalated into a diplomatic dispute between Russia and France (Tate 15). Troubled by the Russian proposals to partition the Ottoman Empire, Britain started gravitating nearer to the French stance. Following the Ottoman Empire's rejection of the ultimatum that would grant Russia the authority to interfere in its internal affairs on behalf of Christians, combat erupted in October 1853. Russia confronted the Ottomans on the Danube and in the Caucasus, but with no conclusive outcome, and was soon compelled to relinquish the latter theater due to Austrian intervention. Unwilling to witness Russia disrupting the equilibrium in both Europe and the Middle East, Britain and France commenced mobilizing and announced war on Russia in March 1854 (Tate 18). A united French-British force reached Bulgaria and then, reinforced by some Ottoman troops, initiated an expedition against Sevastopol, a notable Russian naval base. After landing in Crimea on September 4, they proceeded towards their target and shortly encountered the Russian army awaiting them.
The Russian force, up to 40,000 strong and led by Prince Menshikov, a seasoned veteran of the Napoleonic Wars, held a favorable defensive position between the allies and Sevastopol. The river Alma was not especially deep but still presented a barrier, and its steep left bank, which was seized by the Russians, fortified it further (Baumgart 128). However, the Russian leader believed that the river inclines on his left flank were nearly impassable and only stationed a token force at this juncture (Baumgart 128). The allied force, up to 61,000, had to traverse the shallow river under the Russian gunfire and then ascend the steep hills beyond. Nonetheless, the French general Saint-Arnaud, who also retained overall authority over the allied army, observed what he perceived as Menshikov's critical blunder. A veteran of the colonial combat in Algiers, he judged the hills on the left Russian flank as perfectly accessible for his seasoned troops and resolved to outflank the Russian flank there (Baumgart 128). Concerning the British commander Lord Raglan, he was tasked with assaulting and engaging the Russian right flank while the French fulfilled their role.
Tactically speaking, each of the three armies presented a rather distinct scenario. The French, particularly the light infantry designated Zuaves, applied their Algerian know-how and battled in dispersed skirmish lines to optimize the impact of their rifles while reducing their own losses (Baumgart 129). The British, still adhering to the tactics of Wellington's era, progressed in formations, which could unleash devastating volleys against compact formations but were also rather exposed to enemy fire (Gowing). As for the Russians, they also employed the strategies that served them well in the Napoleonic Wars and primarily battled and maneuvered in battalion columns (Baumgart 68). While formidable in bayonet charges, these columns offered an easy target for the enemy fire. The bulk of the allied infantry were all equipped with contemporary rifles with an efficient range of 500-600 meters, while antiquated Russian smoothbores could not shoot accurately beyond 250 meters (Baumgart 68). Artillery pieces were approximately equivalent in all armies and fired solid shot up to a distance of 3-4 kilometers and canister up to 600 meters, although the precision dwindled considerably with distance.
The engagement commenced in the morning of September 20, with the four divisions of the French army progressing against the Russian left flank and center. As stated earlier, the Russians considered their left to be inaccessible and underestimated it, leaving only a single battalion there (Baumgart 128). The French light infantry invalidated this assessment, scaling the steep slopes by entire battalions and even hauling field guns up (Baumgart 129). Even though Menshikov grasped the danger and dispatched his reserves to the left, it was too late. Although the Russian artillery performed admirably and inflicted casualties on the advancing French, its canister – the sole effective round against infantry – had roughly the same range as the French rifles (Baumgart 129). This enabled the French marksmen to eliminate the gunners rapidly, and subsequently, the unwieldy Russian columns with their antiquated smoothbores were straightforward to engage from a safe distance. Consequently, employing their superior strategies and armaments, the French severely weakened the Russian forces that stood against them and advanced ahead. This maneuver outflanked the Russians and endangered their center, which was already locked in combat with the other portion of the French army.
The British, who advanced against the Russian right flank, encountered more obstacles than their French counterparts. While the Russian position there was more accessible, the Russians had constructed field defenses shielding their guns from enemy fire. As the British formations progressed, Russian guns inflicted increasingly severe casualties on them. The barrage was so intense that a British soldier who participated in the battle described it as a "hurricane of shot and shell" (Gowing). Despite noteworthy casualties, the initial British line succeeded in storming the Russian positions and seizing the guns. However, the Russian infantry swiftly counterattacked and repelled them from the artillery positions with a vigorous bayonet assault. According to the witness, the British "lost a significant number of our men and, by overwhelming numbers… were pushed out of the battery" (Gowing). Nonetheless, the Russians overreached with their counteroffensive and directly encountered the withering volley fire of the subsequent British line. Following that, the British soldiers resumed the offensive and confronted the Russians in intense combat that persisted until the French pressure on its left flank and center forced the Russian army to withdraw.
Observing his left flank turned and his right flank and center pressed, Menshikov opted to retreat. The allies refrained from pursuing the Russians – a choice that was influenced as much by exhaustion and scorching heat as by the Russian supremacy in cavalry and unfamiliar terrain (Baumgart 130). The Russian losses were relatively substantial in relation to the troops engaged and amounted to about 1800 deceased, 3900 wounded, and 700 missing
