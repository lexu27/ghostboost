Cystic Fibrosis Pathogenesis and Cause
Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is an inherited condition that leads to various digestion and breathing problems. Specifically, CF arises from a mutation in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. The gene generates the CFTR protein, which controls the movement of sodium and chloride ions across the epithelial cell membranes (Bowden & Greenberg, 2014). The alterations in one or both copies of the genetic element render the ion transport unreliable and result in an accumulation of thick mucus throughout the body. These abnormalities underlie respiratory insufficiency and other systemic irregularities and blockages (Brown et al., 2017). Therefore, individuals with CF have viscous and adhesive mucus that obstructs their air passages, causing lung injury, trapping bacteria, increasing the incidence of infections, and hindering the passage of essential proteins into the intestines.
CF Clinical Presentations
1. Reduced hunger
2. Exhaustion
3. Elevated cough
4. Diminished spirometry readings
5. Limited response to outpatient therapeutic approaches
6. Hemoptysis (Bowden & Greenberg, 2014).
7. Recurring wheezing
8. Sterility
9. Hepatic cirrhosis
10. Swollen abdomen (Brown et al., 2017).
Interdisciplinary Strategy to CF Care
The management of CF patients necessitates the harmonization of diverse treatment interventions and the inclusion of psychosocial guidance and oversight in medical care. Bowden and Greenberg (2014) characterize CF as a multifaceted ailment that demands specialized attention and therapy. Consequently, although pediatric pulmonologists remain the primary overseers of CF centers, the facilities require other experts such as endocrinologists, infectious disease specialists, gastroenterologists, and geneticists (Bowden & Greenberg, 2014). Additionally, supplementary team members like medical social workers, physiotherapists, advanced practice nurses, dietitians, genetic advisors, child life specialists, and physiotherapists. The integration of interdisciplinary actions is a reliable method to effectively manage CF.
Nursing Care Duties in Cystic Fibrosis Therapy
Nurses primarily play crucial roles in emphasizing the significance of adequate dietary and fluid intake, maintaining sufficient oxygen levels, promoting methods to clear pulmonary secretions, averting complications, and ensuring proper nourishment. Furthermore, nurses also partake in monitoring vital alterations in respiratory condition and heart rate. As per Bowden and Greenberg (2014), nurses assist in providing follow-up services, emotional support, and coordinating responses to treatments. These services aim to aid CF patients in effectively handling the condition.
Feedback on Initial Post
The student performs a remarkable task in addressing all pertinent inquiries. I concur with the post's viewpoints concerning CF origin, physiology, clinical displays, and the necessity for interdisciplinary care. Nonetheless, the student should enhance their delivery approach to prevent offering ambiguous and unsatisfactory responses. In general, the post simplifies the comprehension of fundamental CF knowledge and the most favored treatment methodologies for any reader.
Feedback on Second Post
The writer excels in articulating their thoughts in the exposition. The author methodically and explicitly tackled the questions, facilitating easy comprehension of fundamental CF concepts for the reader. I align with the author's interpretations on the origin and development of the ailment and the role of healthcare providers in managing the condition. Moreover, the manner in which the author expounded on the essentials of CF and its applications in varied contexts is praiseworthy. The post will significantly contribute to educating individuals on the characteristics of CF and its impacts on children.
