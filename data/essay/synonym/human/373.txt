The present problem with Nike originates from its unethical corporate culture, which places women in a vulnerable position. It enables influential men in control of the company to mistreat and oppress them, hindering them from attaining well-deserved positions without facing harassment or degradation. There are four potential approaches to addressing an issue: pardoning, resolving, settling, and dissolving (Ackoff, 2019). Considering the extent and long-term objectives for Nike and society in general, the only appropriate course of action would be to dissolve it. The process of dissolution entails eliminating the root causes for the issue to prevent its recurrence. Pardoning involves overlooking the issue, resolving - compensating the affected women without implementing changes, and settling - empowering them to defend themselves without actively striving to transform the toxic culture into a more positive one (Singh, 2018). Merely empowering women to defend themselves is insufficient - Nike should ensure they are not compelled to do so.

From an organizational framework viewpoint, the overhaul of Nike's culture must be executed at all echelons, from the highest to the lowest. If harassment, favoritism, and dishonesty are tolerated at the top, there is nothing to prevent their presence at the lower levels (Singh, 2018). Consequently, Parker and the remaining members of Nike's leadership team must enforce policies and remedies across all tiers. This entails discouraging such misconduct and ensuring that any potential origins of it are eradicated before they can reemerge.

The suggested course of action, therefore, is to conduct a comprehensive reassessment of each individual employee and manager to ascertain their involvement in the actions that have been ongoing in Nike for generations. All individuals implicated should be dismissed from the company. This includes Mr. Parker and the rest of the board themselves, as they have been profiting from the system while turning a blind eye to it. The new leadership would be responsible for instituting and establishing a new culture founded on equality, competence, and inclusivity.
