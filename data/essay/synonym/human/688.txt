The rise of knowledge society has triggered the further generation of numerous chances for reexamining the current sociocultural, financial, and sociopolitical matters. Particularly, the issue of disparities in the contemporary society has been recognized as one of the main worldwide concerns (Chakravartty 298). In return, non-governmental organizations as the entities that strive to tackle the existence of unfairness have been exerting extra endeavor to handle the perceived injustice. According to the World Summit on Information Society (WSIS), the post-colonial framework must be clearly comprehended to establish policies based on the notion of fairness.
A similar feeling is expressed in Aginamâ€™s paper, where the writer presents an instance of a scenario that demands the influence of WIS to tackle the issue of inequality. Specifically, as outlined by Aginam, the emphasis on the transcultural economy and engagement of a wider array of global participants into the trade procedure will enable exploiting some of the current imbalances (247). Specifically, by seeking collaborations and business expansion opportunities with foreign societies, one will be capable of concentrating on constructing socioeconomic parity and amplify the voices of the sufferers of colonialism.
The concept of aiding minority nations in the post-colonial economy with the aid of WSIS and the associated organizations seems to be pretty encouraging. However, ensuring that the steps taken by the engaged parties are grounded exclusively on the values of morality and variety implies introducing practical management instruments. For this purpose, establishing a global communication conduit for post-colonial communities will be essential.
