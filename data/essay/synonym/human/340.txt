The provided instance study revolves around the alteration procedure within the Norwegian hospital X. The primary concept was to become paperless and transition towards utilizing the most cutting-edge methods to interact with patients, including electronic patient records (EPR) and electronic care plans (ECP). The suggested reassessment was linked to various challenges associated with the nature of new technology and staff experiences and skills. For example, nurses' training to gain knowledge of how to use new approaches was complex due to the lack of time and the absence of experience. Furthermore, nursing aides were unfamiliar with paperwork and documents, which posed an additional limitation. Nonetheless, it is feasible to acknowledge the favorable nature of the outlined change and its potential to enhance positive results. Numerous rationales from the scenario can help to validate this assertion.
To begin with, the change can be examined using Lewin’s model, suggesting three primary stages. These are unfreezing, modification, and refreezing standard for all procedures. Thus, Norwegian hospital management adhered to the model, which acted as the foundation for favorable outcomes. Initial gatherings with the staff and discussions aided in clarifying existing expectations and fears. Throughout this stage, the top management and healthcare workers formulated a shared vision and consented to participate in the change procedure, despite some aspects that could be seen as barriers to achieving success. Additionally, the advantages of incorporating the EPR and ECP were delineated, contributing to the escalating interest and drive to engage in the process. This implies that the successful unfreezing phase was one of the success factors influencing the modification procedure in the designated hospital.
Another favorable aspect of change was the staff’s involvement and readiness to surmount challenges. Hence, the assimilation of new technologies was perceived as something unavoidable, which aided in establishing a positive attitude toward the scope of change. Moreover, notwithstanding some issues encountered during the review of the unit’s operations, the staff maintained a positive outlook on results and the potential for accomplishing current objectives. This indicates that the organizational culture, principles, and philosophy were considered and utilized to establish the groundwork for change and endorse it. Simultaneously, the scenario demonstrates that project participants and employees supported one another during the most crucial moments and were prepared to undertake additional tasks to guarantee the continuity of change and the absence of critical barriers affecting results.
Lastly, the function of leadership should also be acknowledged as managers create the foundation for change. This was accomplished through the close collaboration with team members and a clear delineation of objectives alongside their advantages. Leaders play a pivotal role in any change process as they can introduce necessary adjustments or redistribute resources if any issues arise. For the discussed scenario, effective leadership aided in appropriately addressing the emerging complexities and unifying the staff. The high level of backing and collaboration can be seen as the product of the effective approach chosen by leaders to tackle the issue and ensure the success of the change process. Taken together, the scenario shows that despite several challenges that arose during the process, the change in Norwegian hospitals can be deemed as generally positive. The healthcare workers were driven to acquire new competencies and grasp new techniques to interact with patients and documents.
