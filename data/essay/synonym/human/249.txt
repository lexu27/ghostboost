The subject of the project at hand deals with the consequences of evidence-based practice (EBP) training among nurses on the extent of patient contentment with health care services. Essentially, the project aims to achieve five main goals that address both the well-being of the nurses and patients in the hospital environment:
  * The primary aim of the project is to investigate how the level of EBP knowledge and application by nurses influences the caliber of services they deliver to the patients. As research shows that implementing EBP in the workplace has a positive impact on the nurses' feeling of personal accomplishment, it is logical to infer that such enhancement will influence their drive to carry out work diligently. Consequently, this project will assist healthcare professionals in examining the specifics of this correlation.
  * The second goal of the project is to enhance the overall level of EBP knowledge and implementation among nurses in general medical centers. Even if the intervention of the project does not yield the anticipated outcomes concerning the relationship between patient contentment and EBP training, the latter is still an advantage for the clinical environment. Indeed, the implementation of EBP remains one of the priorities for many general hospitals.
  * The third goal is to investigate the link between EBP training programs and nurses' job contentment. Job satisfaction and drive are fundamental elements of meaningful and effective nursing practice and community engagement. Therefore, this project aims to determine to what extent improving nurses' expertise and self-awareness contributes to their psychological well-being and commitment to their work.
  * The fourth goal of the project is to devise and implement a comprehensive and time-effective EBP introductory training for nurses in general medical centers. One of the numerous reasons behind the lack of EBP implementation in the workplace is the nurses' incapacity to allocate sufficient time for research and analysis. Thus, by introducing a three-day training course that requires nearly six hours to complete, the project may offer insights into the models of meaningful EBP training in a bustling hospital environment.
  * The ultimate goal of the project is to gather thorough feedback on patients' contentment with the care provided by the nurses. Delivering quality health care is one of the primary objectives of any clinical environment, so conducting a patient contentment survey is a valuable method to acquire insights into the existing strengths and weaknesses of the nursing personnel. Therefore, even if the assumption of the project is not validated, the facility will still acquire data on the areas for enhancing services.
All the aforementioned goals for the project are centered on the quality of services rendered to the patients. The entitlement to receive quality health care is one of the fundamental aspects of social fairness, as it assumes equal access to top-notch nursing care irrespective of the individuals' personal convictions and attributes and the nurses' subjective approach. Although many nurses acknowledge the significance of promoting social fairness, excessive workload and lack of personal fulfillment sometimes lead them to extend their exhaustion and job discontent to their behavior towards the patients. Furthermore, burnout and lack of proficiency among nurses impact patient independence or the patients' right to engage in the decision-making process and treatment. To safeguard independence, nurses need to be attentive to the patients' worries and non-medical aspects. Given that the absence of EBP proficiency and the prevalence of burnout contribute to inadequate communication with patients, this project will aid in reinstating patient independence in the workplace. Therefore, the current project aims to explore the possibilities to reduce the level of personal worries and their potential impact on the socially equitable and respectful care of the patients.
