In the contemporary world, varied communities exist that assist families in circumstances of crisis or requirement. Such aid should be given as at times families cannot handle their issues by themselves. Numerous communities offer families with aid in various areas like foster care, early childhood care, education, and homeless services (Fuss et al., 2021). For instance, amid the outbreaks of COVID-19, many families faced financial issues due to the widespread job loss. Many such families were unable to cover their medical expenses or even afford to purchase regular food. Several organizations assist families by looking after their young children or adolescents, providing them with emotional and financial aid (Liebenberg et al., 2020). In such instances, to enhance or bolster the living standard and living conditions, communities can aid families by supplying them with food, shelter, financial aid, or assist them in securing employment. Additionally, virtual communities can be supportive and beneficial for many families. For instance, in times of sorrow, individuals can help one another online or offline; nonetheless, grief support will require new strategies due to COVID-19 (Moore et al., 2020). Communities residing in one region can support families with fires in their apartments by distributing blankets, food, and water or by locating a place to reside. Furthermore, varied populations or communities aiding families in their health concerns are also valuable. Even though it might appear that such aid does not create much disparity, it is entirely incorrect to view the situation from such a standpoint. Firstly, such communities aid individuals or families in incidents of crisis or need, and in this manner, they can extend assistance to numerous individuals. By aiding families, such organizations support not only individual persons or families, but they uphold an acceptable standard of living which supports the nation on the governmental level by maintaining economic indicators at a suitable level.
