Introduction
Supplying patients with sufficient and efficient medication treatments is vital for prompt medical attention and care. In the scrutinized instance of the patient with numerous severe diagnoses, one can pinpoint the ailments that are typical of elderly individuals and are less prevalent in youth. Therefore, as a factor to be scrutinized concerning the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic processes, age will be implicated. This standard can help elucidate suitable drug interventions and recognize optimal treatment schedules to meet the patient’s requirements.
Impact of Age on the Patient’s Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Processes
The scrutinized case study reveals that the patient has serious health issues linked to the cardiovascular system. While acknowledging these diagnoses, the element of age plays a crucial part in pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic processes. For instance, Rosenthal and Burchum (2021) highlight that diuretics, like furosemide, are given to manage high blood pressure and reduce blood cholesterol. Nevertheless, owing to compromised bodily systems in adulthood, diuresis may commence later and endure for a shorter duration than the standard eight hours. As Thürmann (2020) contends, the kidneys and liver, which are tasked with eliminating harmful substances from the body, function inadequately in older patients. Anticoagulants designated for preventing blood clots in individuals with ischemic issues are poorly absorbed (Thürmann, 2020). Consequently, medications in the system of elderly individuals engage in chemical reactions inadequately and have a briefer impact on the body than in younger individuals.
Effects on the Patient’s Medication Regimen
These alterations in the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic processes can influence the drug treatment recommended for the patient. Dodson et al. (2017) assert that polypharmacy may be one of the adverse outcomes of consuming a large number of medications in older individuals with heart disease. Consequently, due to the insufficiently effective consequences of medications and an excess of various components, notably aspirin, the simplest anticoagulant, along with warfarin, perilous health results may manifest. Furthermore, targeted medication treatment directed at regulating the blood glucose level with metformin imposes a strain on the liver, which is risky in adulthood. As a result of these processes, the proposed treatment may pose dangers due to the inadequate resilience of the patient’s body to such medicinal impacts.
Enhancement of the Medication Regimen
To refine the patient’s current medication regimen, some alterations may be beneficial. Since enzyme inhibitors are not encompassed in the treatment scheme, atenolol can be interchanged with metoprolol since the latter is assimilated more rapidly (Kuprash et al., 2020). Hydrochlorothiazide and Spironolactone can be utilized as diuretics that lower blood pressure without burdening the kidneys and liver (Rosenthal & Burchum, 2021). Metformin and Glyburide can persist as they successfully manage the blood sugar level and are combined for the most favorable effect (Rosenthal & Burchum, 2021). The suggested interventions can aid in addressing age-related changes in the patient’s pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic processes.
Conclusion
In the instance under consideration, the patient’s alterations in the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic processes are evaluated from the age standpoint. Pertinent clinical proof sustains the influence of age on health and mirrors the illnesses prevalent in elderly individuals. Based on this, it is recommended to slightly adjust the current medication regimen to tackle poor drug absorption and the risk of organ strain to assist the patient in coping with the severe diagnoses.
