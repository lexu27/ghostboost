Abstract
Knee traumas are highly prevalent, particularly in sports medicine, and can lead to serious outcomes for the individual, constraining their movements and hindering daily activities. There exist four ligaments linking the thigh and shin bones: inner collateral (MCL), outer collateral (LCL), rear cruciate (PCL), and frontal cruciate ligament (ACL) (National Library of Medicine (NLM)). The latter is the central point of the ongoing research. The ACL is placed in the center of the knee joint and maintains the shin bone in position behind the tip of the thigh bone (NLM). When someone overextends a knee joint, sustains a blow on its flank, or abruptly halts and alters direction while sprinting or landing from a leap, the ACL may be excessively stretched or torn (NLM). An ACL injury can also arise alongside other knee traumas, such as a torn MCL or knee cartilage-meniscus (NLM). ACL traumas typically happen in the center of the ligament or when it is dislodged from the thigh bone (NLM). Consequently, the ACL is a crucial yet fragile component of the human body.
The majority of patients with ACL traumas necessitate expert medical assistance and surgery. Once an ACL trauma arises, the space between torn edges hampers autonomous healing (NLM). Hence, patients undergo ACL restoration (ACLR) – the substitution of the torn ligament with a graft (Fineberg et al., 2000). Grafts can be sourced from the individual's body (autografts) or a deceased donor (allografts) (Johnson et al., 1992; Frank & Jackson, 1997). These grafts are frequently harvested from a patellar tendon or a hamstring tendon (Johnson et al., 1992; Frank & Jackson, 1997). Additional allograft sources encompass Achilles, tibialis anterior, and quadriceps tendons (Shino et al., 1986). Nonetheless, a bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) autograft is widely acknowledged as the most suitable and dependable (Kurosaka et al., 1987; Noyes et al., 1984). Despite other kinds of grafts increasing in popularity, it remains the most common selection for ACLR (Lee et al., 2008). Therefore, a bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) autograft as a technique of frontal cruciate ligament restoration (ACLR) was opted for as the subject of examination.
Though BPTB grafts are extensively employed for ACLR, limited research was conducted to recognize and probe all of its potential complications. According to Almazan et al. (2006), intraoperative occurrences and complications during ACLR with a BPTB autograft are fairly frequent due to the intricacy of the procedure. Nonetheless, the researchers concluded that all of them result from technical errors during graft extraction, tunnel insertion, or graft stabilization and are avoidable (Almazan et al., 2006). Severe intra- or post-operative occurrences and complications, such as a patella fracture or a belated patellar tendon rupture, are exceptionally rare (Marumoto et al., 1996). Additionally, Stein et al.'s exploration (2002) illustrated that even such occurrences induced minimal alterations in patients' results when they adhered to post-operative rehabilitation instructions. As Milankov et al. (2012) remarked, it did not influence their mobility, and the majority of the patients persisted in participating in sports activities at the same or even higher level after nine months following ACLR. In essence, ACLR with a BPTB autograft is a complex procedure with several risk elements, yet intraoperative occurrences are preventable and typically entail short-term complications.
Nonetheless, some researchers documented specific long-term complications post-ACLR with a BPTB autograft. These encompass the elevated frequency of frontal knee pain and kneeling pain (Feller & Webster, 2003). It impacts patients’ routines, limiting their mobility and the array of attainable activities. The occurrence of frontal kneeling pain in Saudi Arabia may exceed that registered in global studies. Hence, the objective of the investigation is to discern and ascertain the occurrence of frontal knee pain subsequent to frontal cruciate ligament reconstruction using bone-patellar tendon-bone grafts among the Saudi Arabia populace.
Discussion
Frontal knee pain is a frequent postoperative issue after ACL restoration with a BPTB graft. It is frequently coupled with the challenge of kneeling, which disrupts patients' daily routines (Breitfuss et al., 1996). Several studies pinpointed a high frequency of enduring frontal knee pain and kneeling pain among 25-60% of the patients (Breitfuss et al., 1996; Feller & Webster, 2003; Ibrahim et al., 2005; Pinczewski et al., 2007). Patients continue to grapple with it for up to three years post-ACLR, impeding their complete recuperation (Feller & Webster, 2003; Ibrahim et al., 2005). The showcased data substantiate the pertinence and urgency of the problem.
Numerous studies were carried out to pinpoint methods to decrease or alleviate post-ACLR problems, including frontal knee pain. Tsuda et al. (2001) identified two risk elements for frontal knee pain: frontal instability (side-to-side difference of over 3 mm) and residual patellar bony defect with a depth of more than 2 mm. The specialists suggested utilizing diverse surgical methods to mitigate these risk factors and diminish the frequency of frontal knee pain (Tsuda et al., 2001). Their study showcased a reduction in frontal knee pain rate to 17% (Tsuda et al., 2001). Some researchers concentrated on graft selection and scrutinized its impact on the frequency of kneeling pain. Ibrahim et al. (2005) and Pinczewski et al. (2007) underscored the heightened level of frontal knee pain and other post-operative complications among patients with BPTB grafts in comparison to those with semitendinosus and gracilis (STG) grafts. This raises doubts about whether BPTB grafts are the optimum selection for ACL restoration or an additional risk element for frontal knee pain and kneeling pain.
