One of the primary objectives of a leader of a company is to choose the optimal course of action from the accessible alternatives during the process of decision-making. Clearly, this is unattainable without a comprehensive understanding of a company’s business environment. When it comes to entering the market with the products for the consumers’ consumption, the one concept that experts frequently refer to is the supply and demand principle. This principle is employed to comprehend the customers’ purchasing behaviors and assist managers in planning the product in the market in alignment with them. For example, a lack of interest in the product indicates that supply must be reduced – and conversely: when there is a surge in demand, it is logical to increase the supply of goods as well. Furthermore, a supply and demand analysis aids in pricing: if the demand for the product is high, buyers are more likely to accept price hikes and continue purchasing it. Conversely, with low demand, prices should be reasonably affordable; otherwise, the manufacturer will incur losses. There are diverse tactics to leverage the supply and demand model to one’s benefit. Dayton provides an instance of De Beers – a company specializing in producing diamond jewelry. Their vaults are brimming with diamonds – yet they succeed in upholding high prices for gems by restricting supply. Hence, diamonds remain a scarce commodity, for which as a symbol of status, buyers willingly pay. Another company capitalizing on the supply and demand principle to their benefit is Zappo. Dayton mentions that the company’s primary concept of vending shoes online – namely, without the option of trying them on beforehand – did not appear promising. Nevertheless, Zappo emerged as a success story by gaining command over supply – their vast selection, exceptional customer service, and a favorable return policy prompt buyers to select them repeatedly. Lastly, there is Apple – a renowned titan of the technology industry. Their creation of anticipation for the launch of a service or a product generates demand that makes buyers sense that they are part of something more significant than merely another gadget's market debut. To conclude, the supply and demand principle can certainly be harnessed as a tool for navigating the market – one simply needs to explore suitable methods to exploit it in favor of their product.
