Genetically altered organisms (GMOs) have become a component of all humans’ lives, but they continue to be a disputable topic so far. Some individuals argue that it is not moral to modify any genetic information and play God (MacKinnon & Fiala, 2017). However, I am of the opinion that GMOs are merely another progression in people’s lives like the development of machines, cars, or spaceships. GMOs (whether it be a plant or animal) are a part of my life as well, as I have consumed GMO-based products. I am not worried about long-term impacts as much as some of my peers since I see GMOs as a product of selection that has been in place for centuries. People have observed some traits they considered suitable for them and attempted to cultivate as many plants and animals with specific qualities as possible. I would utilize the principles of utilitarianism to uphold my argument. This philosophy is founded on the belief that everything is moral if it contributes to as much good for as many people as possible. GMOs can aid individuals in overcoming one of the major issues, which is famine. GMOs are resilient to severe environmental conditions, so individuals can cultivate more crops and other crucial plants. Millions of individuals still suffer from hunger and require food, so the increased production of food is advantageous for everyone. Naturally, some adhere to the deontological approach and argue that it is simply incorrect to meddle with genetic codes as it is the divine realm. GMOs are viewed as human efforts to play God, which is morally incorrect. However, I would emphasize that even according to the Bible, humans were entrusted with the planet to look after it, so utilizing innovative tools is another method to adhere to the Christian principles and care for all creatures.
