Confusion regarding Art Deco and Depression styles is widespread even among academics who overlook the notable distinctions in the artistic movements. Art Deco is a French design trend that originates from the Lalique, Art Noveau, and creations of the renowned artist Picasso. Conversely, the Depression style portrays the challenges of poor mental conditions of laboring individuals and aims for them to discover solace in Depression art. In general, while the previously mentioned artistic movements are occasionally blended into the Deco style, they are entirely unique and convey specific meanings to society.

To explain further, the styles differ in their main features, materials, hues, and forms. Consequently, Art Deco is more daring with vivid shades and appealing embellishments, like triangles, zigzags, and even trapezoids. This trend is bold and attention-grabbing, given that the art is somewhat disorderly with all its diverse motives and influences, yet still exceptionally remarkable. Additionally, Art Deco revolves around synthetic materials in terms of sculptures and buildings, which is evident in the interior of Radio City Music Hall at the Rockefeller Center (Soren, 2018).

On the other hand, the Depression trend relates to pessimistic or melancholic emotions, as exemplified in the architecture of Hotel Ambassador in Bucharest (Soren, 2018). Furthermore, the art is relatively simplistic and less daring in contrast to Art Deco as it does not particularly overflow with color and numerous geometric elements. In reality, as the originator of the Depression style, Raymond Loewy, articulates, the style strikes a suitable balance between the absence and abundance of detail (Soren, 2018). Overall, Art Deco and Depression vary in their attributes and implications as they deliver dissimilar messages to the audience.
