Theodor Adorno’s notion of manufacturing culture suggested a strong link between capitalist community and the goods capitalism generates in the artistic domain to boost the current social customs that support the further growth of capitalism. Consequently, Adorno proposed that most media items, like movies, literature, television shows, reinforce the public’s faith in capitalist principles. Conversely, the structural functionalism theory views community as a living organism, where each section of society carries out its role in the sustainability maintenance of the entire organism. Hence, despite the similarities in valuing the significance of stability in society, their distinctions may become more noticeable when applied to contemporary culture and society.
In his hypothesis, Adorno highlighted the overt storyline of mass media items, such as movies and literature, where affluence is frequently linked with joy. However, another instance with a more obvious correlation to strengthening capitalism is amusement for youngsters. From an early age, present-day kids are exposed to various types of media in the shape of television programs, animations, and animated movies. In the structural functionalism perspective, the entertainment sector for youngsters offers a fountain of knowledge and emotional growth. In various ways, the kids’ entertainment sector educates them on crucial ethical behaviors of being generous and courteous to others, which lays the groundwork for stability in the forthcoming society. Nonetheless, in the manufacturing culture perspective, contemporary kids’ entertainment focuses on vending the goods of diverse characters showcased in movies. For instance, one of the most influential corporations, Disney, devised the business strategy of utilizing animated characters to lure kids to their amusement parks (Clement, 2018). Presently, the corporation tactically schedules simultaneous releases of animated movies and goods with the movies’ characters to assure financial gain.
