The 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution was introduced in the latter part of the 19th century, demonstrating the eradication of slavery nationwide. According to the document, each inhabitant of the U.S. can neither subjugate individuals nor be subjugated by fellow U.S. citizens irrespective of gender, ethnicity, age, or any other attribute (U.S. Const. amend. 13, ยง 1). The eradication of slavery throughout the nation has influenced U.S. history and the existence of each American citizen, as this process instigated the reinstatement of personal liberty and nationwide democracy. Despite the current Amendment not exerting such a profound influence on the daily lives of American citizens, its wording implicitly impacts the restriction of human liberty. The Amendment specifies that forced labor is abolished except in instances of criminal penalty, and the absence of further elucidation of this term presently contributes to elevated imprisonment rates among ethnic minorities in the U.S. The 15th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution ensures the privilege to cast a ballot to every American citizen regardless of racial association (U.S. Const. amend. 15, ยง 1). Ratified back in 1870, this Amendment commenced a nationwide transition toward parity and the annulment of constitutional racism. At present, nearly 15% of the U.S. populace are Black, and safeguarding their voting right leads to alterations in the everyday lives of all American occupants, as 15% out of 300 million Americans constitutes the quantity of votes capable of transforming the political discussion of a nation entirely. Besides, the 15th Amendment has acted as a launchpad for the eradication of racism not just on the constitutional plane but on the level of individual connections.
