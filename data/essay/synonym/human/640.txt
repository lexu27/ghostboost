In his text named “The Entitlement Theory”, the thinker Robert Nozick speculates on a genuinely just economic structure in the ideal form of the state. Nozick concentrates on the matter of possession, its transfer and endorsement, presenting a blueprint for asserting fair entitlement (Vaughn, 2019). Genuine justice, according to Nozick, lies in the appropriation of holdings or their original acquisition, their equitable and consensual transfer, and the safeguarding of the right to their property.
According to the principle of just acquisition, individuals can take ownership of property if they do not acquire it from others and do not worsen the situation of others in the process. The principle of just transfer implies the privilege to gift property or voluntarily swap it. Nozick envisions a world in which open exchange will eliminate the presence of a value-currency intermediary – meaning, the needs of individuals will be seen as paramount in the exchange of goods. The principle of endorsement indicates that a person who has unfairly taken possession of a holding is bound to return it to the owner. According to Nozick, no one apart from the owners mentioned in the first two principles has the entitlement to property. The writer identifies a just transfer of property only in those instances when the property was initially acquired justly and all subsequent phases in its transfer are identical.
The author terms this principle of just distribution historical, in which it is through the circumstances or actions of acquisition that one can assess the fairness of the possession of an item. Drawing from John Locke’s principle of the self-possession of individuals, Nozick mentions that individuals possess a collection of talents that belong to them. Merging these talents with the surrounding world, they can lay claim to the acquisition of a portion of this world by consent, that is, to acquire property.
