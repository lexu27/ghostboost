African American spirituals are songs created by Africans who were kidnapped and transported to the United States to be traded into slavery. While they were deprived of their languages, families, and culture, their owners could not strip away their musical traits. A African American spiritual called Ring Shout uniquely conveys African Christianity. Ring Shout is distinguished by hand clapping, footsteps, and other percussion accompanying the rich orchestral singing of the leader and chorus in this folk spiritual. It features a highly stylized religious dance in which participants dance in counter-clockwise circuits (blackhistorywalks 6:24). In the United States, the term “spiritual” is most closely linked with the racial oppression of African Americans. Concerning traditional music, the African American spiritual, also known as the African American Spiritual, is among the most significant and most prominent cultural customs (blackhistorywalks).
A few well-known spirituals are Wallis Willis’ Swing low, dear chariot, and Deep down my heart (African American Spirituals). The term “spiritual” originates from a King James Bible conversion of Ephesians 5:19: “Speaking to yourself in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs and singing and making melody in your hearts to the Lord.” (African American Spirituals). African slaves held “praise houses” and outdoor assemblies titled bush or camp meetings, and brush arbor meetings where they met informally to discuss their conditions of slavery (African American Spirituals). There were ecstatic trances at the gatherings where people would sing, chant, and dance.
Enslaved Africans sang about their predicament to the American slave lords through the spiritual hymns (blackhistorywalks 5:34). Slave lords permitted their slaves to follow specific Eurocentric religious rituals, although they did not have the right to free speech. Nevertheless, they had no idea that a rich culture full of exceptional and intricate songs would emerge from that, serving as the soundtrack to some people’s spiritual life (blackhistorywalks). Call and response is a crucial aspect of African American spirituals. It later made its way into other musical genres, including the blues and gospel. According to Sonia Caldwell in the documentary Origin of the African American Spiritual (10:20), as a form of resistance, spirituals were used by enslaved people because they wanted to retain African components in their lives. The African American spiritual is occasionally cited as the origin of all subsequent musical styles due to its widespread influence.
In the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, spirituals played a vital role in black people’s protests. Spirituals and Gospel songs were indispensable in the civil rights movements of the 1950s and 1960s (African American Spirituals). The majority of the “liberation songs” of the era, such as Eye on the Prize and , Oh Freedom were based on old spirituals. Songs based on spirituals have been used in various countries worldwide, including Russia, East Europe, South Africa, and China. In creating new protest songs, several of today’s best-known pop singers continue to draw inspiration from the spirituals of the past. Songs like Redemption Song by Bob Marley and Billy Bragg’s Sing their souls back home are good examples. Everyone who participated in the ring scream felt a sense of accomplishment and camaraderie after the event. African American spirituals enabled African-Americans to express their identities and capacities. Because of the prejudice of white superiors who were adverse to the results of the Civil War, African American Spirituals were also immensely popular amongst African Americans. African Americans discovered a means to deal with their misfortunes through spirituals, which is why African American Spirituals are considered a part of the African American criterion for American Identity. African American Spirituals inspired African-Americans to unite and fight for their rights, encouraging them to demonstrate their strength in numbers.
