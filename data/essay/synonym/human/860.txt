Being a well-developed marketplace with a high purchasing power of the populace, Canada offers a variety of opportunities for foreign exports, specifically the U.S. Within this context, agricultural exports constitute a significant portion of the overall commerce. Canada remains the U.S.’s second-largest ally in this aspect, and the connections are backed by favorable pacts between the nations. This study assesses Canada as an agricultural export location focusing on nuts and pistachios, specifically.
The procedure of agricultural export into Canada is well-controlled, which enhances the safety and openness of trade relationships. As per the U.S. International Trade Administration, Canada makes up 15% of the nation’s complete agricultural exports with $22 billion, most of which are consumer-focused. Through this interchange, Canada acquires high-value goods for its populace, while the U.S. sustains over 130,000 occupations. Since 1989, the majority of American agricultural products have entered Canada without duties under the NAFTA and U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement, presently replaced by the USMCA. Goods managed by supply, like dairy and eggs, are not included in the agreement, which still signifies that pistachio exports will profit from duty-free relationships. According to the agreement, all deliveries must have a USMCA Certification of Origin alongside the usual export documentation package (Government of Canada). For the consumer’s protection, Canada demands all exporters to provide a Phytosanitary Certificate for plant goods. They formally verified that they are pest-free, complying with the importer’s sanitary prerequisites, and have been examined by the authorized agency of the United States (Government of Canada). This ensures the general safety of agricultural exports. Due to the beneficial trade environment, the export turnover between the United States and Canada has been substantial. Within this, nuts trade has been significant, as influenced by the climatic variances. Table 1 depicts the trends of the agricultural product and nut export to Canada. Table 2 includes the past of pistachio importation in Canada.

Overall, Canada persists as one of the primary trade partners of the United States, influenced by the geographical nearness of the nations, along with their policy congruence. These relationships are properly controlled by a history of mutually beneficial agreements that alleviate bureaucratic obstacles while supporting the safety and openness of the trade. Pistachio exports into Canada possess an expanded potential in this aspect, provided that the sanitary requirements are respected.
