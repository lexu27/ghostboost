The selection of vessel is linked to the operational expenses of shipping. Stopford (2009) argues that the optimal approach to cut down expenses is to opt for more recent vessels, which necessitate fewer crew, reduced upkeep, and enhanced dependability. Although these aspects hold true, they do not inherently position newer vessels as the preferred option for shipping expenses. Currently, 65% of global freight vessels are above 14 years old, indicating fierce competition for modern vessels (Cheng, 2021). Elevated demand leads to escalated expenses, as evidenced by the surge in shipping charges in 2021 and previously in 2016 (Cheng, 2021). Both of these upswings witnessed an uptick in the demand for older vessel services.
Typically, the quoted expenses of shipping via elder ships are lower. The rationales for this are the decreased costs of procuring a vessel, resulting in diminished urgency to settle the interest promptly (Ros Chaos et al., 2021). Furthermore, enterprises operating elder vessels are cognizant of their drawbacks, thereby requiring to offset them by proposing a more favorable price. Lastly, specific operating expenses for elder vessels can be alleviated by employing substandard fuel, which these vessels can still function with (Ros Chaos et al., 2021). Additionally, while repairs and upkeep for aging vessels are more recurrent in contrast to modern ships, the expenses for these renovations are often lesser. New vessels entail costly and delicate machinery, necessitating more time and funds to mend and substitute (Ros Chaos et al., 2021). Elder vessels are less technologically advanced, implying simpler and more economical maintenance.
On the whole, with two-thirds of the planet’s cargo being transported by elder vessels, Stopford’s deductions about newer vessels being superior are invalidated. While, theoretically, such an inference appears evident, practically, a corporation must grapple with fluctuating shipping charges (which are higher for modern vessels), accessibility, and a plethora of other variables. If deliveries are frequent and cannot tolerate delays, the shipper will need to settle not for the optimum solution but for what is currently accessible. The likelihood is that it will be an elder vessel.
