Data analytics is the field that examines the life cycle of digital information from emergence to utilization in other realms of knowledge. It entails exploring and scrutinizing significant quantities of data and is primarily concentrated on achieving tangible outcomes. The interpretation proposed by Os Keyes assumes that this discipline is the simplification of mankind to something that can be quantified. This viewpoint is intriguing in a manner that opposes Keyes's conventional definition of data analytics. Possibly, her statement implies that everything in this universe could be gauged as the field is concerned with quantifiable entities and numerical evaluation. Additionally, there is a presumption that data analytics systems aim to consume everything feasible, encompassing a person's existence, and measure it. Lastly, concerning the decision-making procedure, the systems eradicate the human element, excluding individuals, thereby rendering it impersonal.
Many standardized evaluations rely on an algorithm that prohibits individuals from expressing their viewpoints. Generally, they are multiple-choice exams where one must select the correct solution. A single error places one in an irreversible situation. This indicates that systems only acknowledge accurate data, disallowing room for human fallibility. Consequently, humanity is conditioned to provide correct responses when necessary and simultaneously apprehensive about articulating something that will not be automatically validated.
Conversely, data analytics is crucial in domains where errors must be averted. For instance, in the medical sector, professionals utilize various electronic platforms that aid them in selecting the appropriate therapy and its dosage. Medication mistakes primarily arise from human elements, such as when experts overlook checking a drug's expiration date. Meanwhile, the system will propose the superior medication for the patient and guarantee its non-expiry.
