The topic of euthanasia is an exceedingly sensitive subject of discourse that is encircled by numerous moral debates. Broadly speaking, euthanasia as a concept is utilized to portray intentional action to painlessly terminate a person’s life to end their suffering. On one side, proponents of euthanasia discuss an individual's autonomy in making decisions regarding life and death and refer to the act as 'mercy killing' because it alleviates people's pain. Conversely, opponents of euthanasia debate the sanctity of life and equate the act with murder. Nonetheless, based on a few ethical ideologies – specifically, teleology, deontology, and Levina's "face of the other" – euthanasia is highly unethical and conflicts with all conceivable moral principles.

Teleology is the analysis of entities in relation to the purposes they serve, and it was heavily depended on by Aristotle. He believed that everything had a purpose – including human life: he perceived it as structured and aimed towards the final objective. Regarding what Aristotle regarded as the final objective, it was "complete good" – happiness, the ultimate aim of all our endeavors that makes a human life "lacking nothing" (Aristotle, 2017, p. 247). Clearly, all our endeavors are directed at accomplishing a goal, even though most are means to attaining other goals. Happiness is a goal in itself – the ultimate goal; thus, it is the highest good. The dilemma arises when different individuals have differing opinions on what constitutes a happy or good life – the aim of ethics is to resolve this issue. However, it is improbable for that solution to be death – which is the consequence of euthanasia; hence, one can infer that the practice of euthanasia would be considered unethical from Aristotle's viewpoint.

The doctrine of deontology is the belief that individuals have a moral duty to act in accordance with a specific set of rules and principles. Immanuel Kant was a prominent proponent of this theory, and he articulated its most significant form. In contrast to deontological theory's religious connotations, Kant's theory's principles are derived from human reason. According to Kant, "some actions are inherently wrong," irrespective of their consequences (Kant, 2019, p. 30). This is how actions are judged in deontology – irrespective of the final outcome. Concerning euthanasia, the consequence could be perceived as positive – an individual can evade suffering. However, morally speaking, ending another person's life would likely be deemed inherently wrong. Thus, the act of euthanasia is unethical from the perspective of Kant's deontological theory as well.

"The face of the other" is Emmanuel Lévinas's theory – a French philosopher from the 20th century – that suggests individuals are accountable for each other in interpersonal encounters. He posited that his ethical commitment to loving others stems from his incapacity to survive in isolation and derive meaning "within its own being-in-the-world, within the ontology of sameness" (My Jewish Learning, n.d.). According to Lévinas, another person's right to exist takes precedence over one's own, and it is enshrined in an ethical imperative: one must not kill, and one must not jeopardize another's life. Consequently, from this standpoint, euthanasia would be deemed as a transgression against another's life.

In conclusion, euthanasia is likely to be deemed unethical from the perspective of any of these theories. From a teleological perspective, pursuits that lead to a happy or good life cannot be pursued – hence, euthanasia, with its consequence being death, could hardly be seen as beneficial. Furthermore, based on Kant's deontological theory, there are actions that are inherently wrong, irrespective of the result, which aligns with euthanasia – essentially, a killing that liberates one from suffering. Additionally, Lévinas talks about prioritizing someone else's life over one's own since existence is only meaningful in the presence of others – euthanasia, from his viewpoint, would be considered an encroachment on another's life.
