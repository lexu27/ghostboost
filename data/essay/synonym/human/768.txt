Analyzing societal changes unfolding in the U.S. at the start of the 20 th century, one must acknowledge that the speed and magnitude achieved by the feminist movement were among the most remarkable. By questioning social conventions and accepted gender roles, American women reshaped how they were viewed in society, consequently reshaping the gender dynamics within it. When contemplating the legal statutes and measures that facilitated the aforementioned transformation, one must bring up the 19 th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. However, the process of ensuring the adoption of the 19 th Amendment has not followed a straight and uniform path, primarily due to the existence of racism and race-based biases in some states. While the early Suffrage movement lacked inclusivity and the related viewpoints, it did establish the groundwork for the 19 th Amendment despite strong opposition to change from certain more bigoted Tennessee women, who perceived the legislation as a means of broadening the rights of African Americans.

Notably, the arguments that renowned suffragettes put forth in their discourse on the 19 th Amendment varied significantly. For example, Belle Kearney, while advocating for the empowerment of women, concentrated mainly on White middle-class individuals, whereas Adella Hunt Logan actively championed the liberation of women from all races and ethnicities (Hewitt and Lawson 2019). In contrast, the standpoint that Kearney presented differed considerably from those of other prominent suffragettes. For instance, Addams, who also strongly endorsed the incorporation of the 19 th Amendment into the sociocultural and sociopolitical landscape of the U.S., perceived it primarily as a "natural extension of household duties" (666). Consequently, the interpretation of the significance of voting rights for women that Addams provided did not attribute particularly high importance to the change.

The specific notion of perceiving the acquisition of the right to vote as trivializing the profound impact that voting rights had on female American citizens. Thus, Winslow's portrayal of the issue is understandably more favored as she emphasized that the 19 th Amendment was an opportunity to address the significant injustice that American women had endured. Specifically, Winslow described the change in question as the moral and cultural awakening of the U.S. She elaborated that substantial shifts in social dynamics were inevitable once "the President realizes that brutal bullying isn't quite a statesmanlike method for setting a demand for justice at home" (669). Consequently, the perspectives on the matter varied significantly, yet the general notion of change was viewed as overwhelmingly positive.

Regrettably, not all women fully endorsed the introduction of the 19 th Amendment into the American sociopolitical and sociocultural milieu. For example, Tennessee women became notorious for their endeavors to oppose the implementation of the Amendment and ultimately prohibit it (Hewitt and Lawson 2019). To analyze the nature of the described conflict, one should highlight the explicit racism prevalent in American society at that time (Hewitt and Lawson 2019). According to Hewitt and Lawson (2019), Tennessee women feared that the 19 th Amendment would pave the way for African Americans in general to attain voting rights, a prospect the Tennessee demonstrators deemed unacceptable. The protests by the Tennessee women underscored significant injustices within American society, underscoring the importance of the intersectionality of the feminist movement. Specifically, for it to evolve into a genuine struggle for equal rights and against gender-based oppression, the Suffragette movement had to encompass African American, Native American, and Latin American women, as well as women of all descents. Consequently, the importance of integration and support for African American women came to the fore, with Logan being among the first to directly address the issue (Hewitt and Lawson 2019).

Similarly, one could argue that the suffragettes represented by the Tennessee women constituted the minority. It is probable that prominent feminists of the era would have reacted with outrage and advocated for supporting African American women and women from other racial and ethnic backgrounds. For instance, Logan's arguments concerning the significance of supporting all women, including African American, Native American, and Latin American women, should be highlighted (Hewitt and Lawson 2019). Thus, the emphasis on multiculturalism and intersectionality was significant despite the presence of racism in the ideologies of certain members of the movement.

Finally, it would be erroneous to isolate the American Suffragette movement from the broader societal trends observed in the U.S. during that period. Specifically, progressive elements, such as the opposition to segregation and the focus on the needs of the laboring class intersected considerably with the Suffragette movement. Therefore, the sociocultural and sociopolitical changes witnessed in the U.S. in the 1920s could be perceived as a unified progressive movement and a force for positive change.

Although not as inclusive due to overlooking the specific needs of African American women and their underrepresentation, the U.S. Suffragette movement of the 1920s established a platform for further empowering American women. However, the issue of racism and the resulting hurdles in advancing the legislation have underscored the imperative of inclusivity and the fundamental principles of humanity as inseparable from feminism. Embracing the needs of all women and promoting an interventionist perspective, particularly fostering unity among women of all races, faiths, and ethnic backgrounds, has emerged as the central focus of the feminist movement. Consequently, the described transformation has set the course for the evolution of the American Suffrage movement.
