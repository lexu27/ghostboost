In Babylonia and Egypt, the initial monarchs likewise collaborated with priests and relied on their backing. However, Egyptian monarchs, specifically known as pharaohs, were viewed as rulers of the entire area and clearly surpassed priests, whereas Babylonia monarchs cooperated closely with them (Brooks, 2019). Another notable contrast is the source of the state’s leaders, as Babylonia monarchs were also fighters who led their community in conflicts with their neighbors, while Egyptian pharaohs were believed to be deity-rulers (Brooks, 2019). Egypt was a centralized entity, unlike Babylonia, which presented itself as numerous distinct states. Moreover, disparities in spiritual perspectives emerged from alternative outlooks on why the deities formed humans. Babylonia perceived deities to be harsh and thought that humans were not meant to savor life and could potentially offend the deities (Brooks, 2019). Unlike the Egyptians, they did not have faith in the afterlife, conceivably due to the deity’s disposition towards individuals. In Egypt, a religious, moral code sanctioned by deities directed each inhabitant (Kreis, 2006). This is why the afterlife was such a crucial component of their convictions - it was a mechanism that assessed their virtue throughout existence. The spiritual and farming progress inevitably led to the mental and cultural advancement of the nations. The Intermediate Period of Egypt is renowned for its papyrus utilization, alongside ink and cosmetics (Brooks, 2019). Embalming was a vital procedure linked to their general spiritual convictions. Conversely, the combat and commerce typical for Babylonia elucidate their development of the wheel and significant enhancement of architecture and the sciences (Brooks, 2019). It can be proposed that religion played a significant part in the pioneering innovations of Egypt (Kreis, 2006). Broadly, the primary distinctions between the regions arose from differing spiritual and administrative systems.
