The presence and proper operation of democracy rely heavily on the capacity of the community to unite and engage within its societies to address unsettled matters. The writer of the piece "Bowling Alone: America’s Decreasing Social Capital" examines and scrutinizes the demonstrations of the civil society of the United States of America by evaluating its transformation. Civil society as a representation of democracy possesses its social wealth, which is distinguished by the establishment of social connections among individuals. The caliber of such associations permits prompt and efficient resolution of challenging matters because of the constant awareness and engagement of the implicated persons within the society. Indeed, Putnam argues that "such connections enable coordination and communication, enhance reputations, and thereby enable predicaments of collective action to be settled" (66). Therefore, generally, civil societies that establish connections are able to aid the operation of a democratic society.
Nonetheless, the current tendencies in American society suggest an adverse alteration in the willingness of individuals to participate in social connections and communicate with others for social issue resolution. Over the recent decades, the quantity of clubs, organizational groups, alliances, religious networks, and other types of civic involvement has notably decreased. One of the causes for such a decline in social wealth is the growth in people’s mobility and homeownership, which implies relocating frequently and the absence of a need to establish strong social ties. According to Putnam, "mobility, like frequent re-potting of plants, tends to disrupt root systems, and it takes time for an uprooted individual to establish new roots" (72). Hence, alterations in the lifestyles of Americans have resulted in reduced social wealth and network engagement, which could ultimately have an adverse effect on the progression of democracy in the USA.
