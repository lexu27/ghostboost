With coagulation of the lower extremities’ veins, clots or blood clots form cavities, which disrupt the normal flow of blood. Over time, they can obstruct the venous lumen and even detach, culminating in the heart, lungs, and other organs (Dalen, 2016). Regrettably, it is frequently challenging to promptly identify the initial indications of coagulation of the leg vessels. Nevertheless, if the skin changes hue and swelling arises where the blood clot is situated, these are indications of vascular disease.
As coagulation advances, its symptoms manifest: sudden pain and heaviness in the patient’s legs. These symptoms are instigated by the venous congestion beneath the location of coagulation. The primary causes of the ailment’s progression are blood clotting and harm to the vein wall (Thachil & Bagot, 2018). Moreover, lengthy travels and old age worsen the risk of severe issues. It is also plausible that the patient is consuming medications that augment blood clotting, so it is imperative to inquire about this to confirm the diagnosis.
Techniques to establish a precise diagnosis comprise duplex scanning, radiopaque phlebography, MRI, or CT. The amalgamation of these techniques will most accurately discern the severity and nature of the ailment. Subsequently, a physician can recommend an appropriate treatment. Among the medications, it can be injections of heparin and capsules of anticoagulants. If these approaches are ineffective, then thrombolysis is indispensable, which facilitates the absorption of blood clots. In the most severe scenario, surgery will be necessary. Unquestionably, this is the final recourse since it is always crucial to exhaust all the other methods before resorting to it. It may also be perilous considering the age of the patient under consideration. Hence, it is crucial to employ alternative approaches and endeavor to prevent any detrimental consequences. Not only will this aid in curing coagulation but also in preserving the patient’s life.
