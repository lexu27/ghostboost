Everyone has perused detective tales at least once in their life or watched detective programs on TV. Sometimes it could be observed that the protagonists of the works use so-called embossed writings. These inscriptions can be on the second, third, and so on pages, depending on the pressure on the writing implement, that is, a pen or pencil. Despite the fact that such records are hard to discern, the examiners still possess the expertise and specialized equipment to ensure that this concealment was divulged.

Embossed writing is imperceptible indentations in the sheets of paper situated under the page on which the information was initially inscribed. Embossed writing can aid in resolving a case, as it frequently contains the information required for the investigation (Girard, 2017). To visualize the inscriptions, one can utilize a pencil, but for forensic experts, it is an unprofessional tool that can solely jeopardize the evidence. Embossed entries often do not correspond to the information inscribed on the surface of the original document.

To unveil the information, specialists utilize various professional equipment. This encompasses a tool for a laboratory that functions to restore documents with indents. Furthermore, a photographic technique is employed, which is grounded on sliding light, and an electrostatic detection device is also utilized (Girard, 2017). Undoubtedly, specialists must possess the requisite skills and knowledge to detect information inscribed using indentation. Furthermore, the utilization of a soft pencil or copy paper can mar crucial details, and thus the use of these methods of amateur examination is forbidden.

In conclusion, embossed writing is a prevalent practice in the criminal realm. When inscribing with indents, the necessary information remains concealed since it is imperceptible and is imprinted on the pages succeeding the original. With this tool, one can obscure numerous vital and personal data. To uncover the inscriptions, specialists are indispensable and equipment that will enable the records to be declassified and not harm the evidence.
