A individual’s life is inconceivable without interaction with other individuals. The necessity to communicate one’s thoughts and experiences led to verbal, then scripted language. To clearly and logically communicate one’s thoughts with the conversation partner, it is crucial to be familiar with the fundamental principles of language etiquette. An individual speaking in public should speak eloquently, construct sentences correctly, and establish a connection with the audience. Reciting from a document is always perceived superficially, which is why the speaker must adeptly utilize both verbal and non-verbal methods of language. This study is focused on body language during the addresses of Martin Luther King “I Have a Dream” and Alicia Garza from the movement “Black Lives Matter.” Both orators are magnetic and can capture the audience’s attention due to their high proficiency of body language.

In his public address, King advocated for civil and financial rights and an end to racism in the United States. Furthermore, he discussed about uniformity and brotherhood among individuals of all colors and nationalities. King’s address comprised elements delineating the necessity for employment and liberty for the black population (Rare Facts, 2018). In her talk devoted to the Black Lives Matter movement, Garza also talks about the significance of uniformity and acceptance towards the black population (Center for Constitutional Rights, 2015). She contends that racism and racial bias have no place in contemporary civilized society and calls on the audience to combat against any displays of racism.

These addresses have specific resemblances and variations, which are initially manifested in the manner of the speaker. The parallels of the addresses are rooted in the shared theme they are dedicated to the battle against racism and disparity towards black individuals. Both orators discuss unjust treatment, partiality, and the necessity for acceptance since all individuals were created equal. King and Garza actively utilize the visual-movement sign system, including gestures and facial expressions (Center for Constitutional Rights, 2015). Additionally, both orators are acquainted with the tactics of paralinguistics and extralinguistics, that is, the scope and tonality of the voice and the incorporation of breaks in speech. Nevertheless, it is not hard to discern disparities in the approach to the delivery of King and Garza.

King’s voice appears much more rehearsed and filled with inflections; it flows leisurely and then quickens, becoming more thrilling and fervent. Throughout King’s address, it is challenging to divert attention from him and engage in something else since his voice and rather commanding manner of speech fully engage and do not release until the conclusion (Rare Facts, 2018). Garza’s delivery seems quieter, and her intonations are balanced, as if she is not striving to persuade the audience of her perspective but merely stating facts (Center for Constitutional Rights, 2015). Moreover, King’s address is brimming with metaphors and vivid images and repetitions of the precise phrase, which is also the title of the discourse itself. All of this establishes a distinct impression and enables the orator’s performance to occupy the audience’s thoughts for an extended period.

It can also be mentioned that the location where the address was given plays a substantial role in influencing the audience. King’s address was presented from the stairs of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, which contributes to its importance and the essential ambiance since this location is one of the most crucial for Americans (Rare Facts, 2018). Garza’s address, conversely, cannot flaunt a specific place of utterance, and thus does not linger in memory as much, being just one of numerous addresses on this platform (Center for Constitutional Rights, 2015). Lastly, the audience, who is present during the address, is crucial. Primarily, King’s audience, consisting of regular black laborers, comprehended well what he was discussing and hence supported him. Garza’s audience is also well-informed about the topics raised in the address, thereby lending more weight to the orator’s speech.
