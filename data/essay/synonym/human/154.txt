In the annals of humankind, the computer has emerged as one of the most crucial creations. Scarcely anyone can envision a contemporary household or workplace devoid of computers. While some individuals contend that the computer has bestowed upon us supplementary comforts, as per others, the computer has rendered our life more intricate and demanding. I am of the opinion that computers, primarily, have enriched our society with numerous benefits owing to swifter communication and simpler access to information.
The computer furnishes us with a rapid means to communicate. In our era, as modern society is evolving into a more global entity, computers are pivotal in communication networks. Previously, communication was confined to methods such as post (Grudin, 2017). If a businessperson traveled overseas, the dispatching of reports and memoranda typically entailed noteworthy delays. Given that the competitiveness of a business hinges on time, this scenario was utterly unacceptable. The Internet has empowered businesses to dispatch messages instantaneously. Personnel can transmit emails or instant messages to a supervisor anywhere globally (Grudin, 2017). This has enhanced efficiency for businesses and broadened business prospects.
To me, a computer is a technological imperative that enhances my life's enjoyment and fascination. Primarily, a computer serves as an exceptional pastime implement. Viewing movies and various science fiction programs via my electronic accomplice is exceedingly convenient and cozy. Moreover, my daily occupation, which yields the majority of my financial earnings, is closely linked to the computer, hence it is not solely a means of interaction and amusement but also a mechanism for earning a living.
Medical professionals and other healthcare practitioners utilize computers for numerous crucial purposes. Computer hardware is extensively employed in rendering diagnoses, conducting examinations, and preventive screenings are instances of computer apparatus and methodologies for treatment and diagnosis (Farinella & Marco, 2018). Computed tomography and nuclear medical diagnostics yield precise layered images of internal organ structures (Farinella & Marco, 2018). Ultrasound diagnostics and probing, utilizing the impacts of the interplay of incident and reflected ultrasonic waves, unveil myriad possibilities for capturing images of internal organs and scrutinizing their state. The interventions of computers will greatly simplify diagnostics and treatment methodologies.
