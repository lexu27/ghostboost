Social obligation involves policies that organizations implement as part of a company’s governance aimed at ensuring the corporate’s functions are efficient and advantageous to all stakeholders. These principles help safeguard the environment, enhance the quality of life for communities, and provide a favorable working environment by acknowledging and valuing skilled and diligent employees. This enhances customer loyalty as patrons sense they are supporting the business endorse worthwhile endeavors, thereby facilitating more access to funds and attracting more investors to join and back the company.
The enterprise rewards employees through significant praises, which make them valued. It affords workers an opportunity to lead by example while granting them the ability to make decisions without intervention, demonstrating that they are trusted and competent (Yang et al., 2019). Additional financial incentives include annual or biannual bonuses. Moreover, compensated time-off and monetary rewards help improve performance while fostering morale.
The firm practices CSR by adopting a business code of ethics, which influences employees' conduct on ethics, norms, environment, self-respect, and customer care. The institution has implemented reliable systems to safeguard personnel and prevent accidents and mishaps (Tamvada, 2020). It also ensures suppliers are informed of and fulfill the requirements of responsible behavior regarding matters such as reasonable expenses. For example, scrutinizing vendors to ascertain their previous conduct and discuss what the company anticipates.
The sole alteration in CSR that I would propose is how the organization handles employees’ inventiveness. I would urge the company to establish a platform for idea generation, thereby fostering fresh concepts and innovation (Tamvada, 2020). Concerning grievances about the company's involvement and expenditures, it is apparent that the business is endeavoring to enhance CSR, and the more it progresses in that direction, the more it prospers. For instance, experiencing increased brand recognition translates to growth in sales.
Nestle has strived to become a socially responsible and environmentally sustainable corporation. Hence, it is eligible for approval because of its remarkable accomplishment in empowering communities. It has elevated people’s living standards, granting access to sanitation and pure water and inspiring populations to lead healthy lives. I would propose the company implement an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) procedure (Tamvada, 2020). ERM should be utilized as it is designed to identify potential events that can impact the business. This will also aid in managing risks and opportunities and establishing significant assurance regarding company goals.
