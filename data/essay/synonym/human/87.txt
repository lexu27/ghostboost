The tale Atonement, penned by Ian McEwan, delves into the theme of the importance of writing. The writer employs diverse literary techniques to communicate numerous ideas in the tale. Leveraging the all-knowing storyteller, the author aims to depict an individual's sentiments endeavoring to make amends for transgressions through writing. The portrayal of the primary character, Briony, exemplifies how writing can assist individuals in coming to terms with their own wrongdoings. The writer utilizes different forms of irony and the all-knowing narrator perspective to convey the concept of easing sorrow and remorse through writing.
The significance of writing and storytelling in dealing with guilt, sorrow, or trauma is primarily conveyed through two literary techniques. The initial one is irony: situational and verbal. Irony serves as a satirical method through which the writer assesses the topic involving dual meanings. The truth is not in the assertion but in its opposing significance. The author employs verbal irony to elaborate on the characters' emotions. "Now you're sticking to the salad while the rest of us are suffering" (121). This form of irony is utilized to denounce the narrator's actions. Such writing framework is a means to admit fault in actions leading to others' suffering. "When the wounded were screaming, you dreamed of sharing a little house somewhere" (227). This excerpt also embodies the narrator's acknowledgment of her actions against her loved ones.
Crafting a story, the narrator aims to afford characters the chance to lead lives they were deprived of. The narrator stresses that she has taken away the lives of those she cherished. People cannot be revived, and the narrator has no opportunity for absolution. Hence, she constructs a story where she can make amends for her wrongdoings. Situational irony is employed to illustrate the narrator's regret while trying to utilize writing to cope with loss. Towards the end of the novel, the narrator admits that the reunion of characters never transpired (310). The cheerful conclusion exists because she resolves to make amends for her own transgressions through the story. Unable to alter their fates, the writer fashions a new existence for these individuals in the narrative.
Another element aiding in conveying the aforementioned theme is the all-knowing narrator perspective. In such stories, the narrator simultaneously serves as a character and aligns themselves with the first person pronoun "I." This type of narrator enables the effective expression of the narrator's thoughts and sentiments, concealed and beyond reach to an external observer, paving the way for various forms of introspection. "How can a novelist achieve atonement when, with her absolute power of deciding outcomes, she is also God?" (325). This instance illustrates the narrator regarding writing as a palliative measure aiding in overcoming loss. However, the narrative technique enables readers to comprehend that the narrator yearns to be with her loved ones and cannot surmount the separation from them. In truth, the reader acknowledges that atonement was unattainable for the narrator. Through writing, she dedicates her existence to those whose lives she shattered. Despite the potential impossibility of atoning Briony's mental anguish, she assuages her sorrow and culpability through writing.
The discussed subject is crucial for me personally and society at large in terms of grasping the writer's sentiments. Life is unpredictable, and numerous incidents that haunt individuals throughout their lives may arise. Each person discovers their individual approach to surmounting traumas. Writing presents an ideal opportunity to remain faithful to loved ones and articulate one's regrets. It is morally comforting when the audience reads and acknowledges the author's admissions. For me, writing might aid in maintaining moral equilibrium and commemorating losses and tragedies, which is indispensable for ethical growth and the transmission of cultural heritage within society.
