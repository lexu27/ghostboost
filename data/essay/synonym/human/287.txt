Gnomial Functions Incorporated desires to identify the most dependable predictive method for estimating the sales volume for the subsequent eighteen months. The sales pattern showed a steady growth over the previous 18 months with minimal seasonal fluctuations. However, the sales in recent months had more impact on the sales in the following months (Wisniewski, 2016). Hence, Gnomial Functions Incorporated should employ the weighted moving mean to predict the most probable sales level.
The weighted moving average utilized four coefficients to predict the probable sales level in the next month. These coefficients varied from 0.1 to 0.4 for the earliest and most recent months respectively. The most recent information received a greater coefficient due to its higher relevance to the future sales level. Consequently, the weighted moving average produces precise forecasts compared to the simple moving averages.
The organization can achieve even more precise forecasts by modifying the coefficients for the moving average. The administration should assign a higher coefficient to the recent monthly sales to minimize the forecasting error. Specifically, the mean absolute deviation and mean standard error for the original coefficients (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4) were 6.27 and 47.29. Conversely, when the new coefficients that prioritize the recent performance (0, 0, 0.4, and 0.6) are employed, the mean absolute deviation decreased to 4.81, and the mean standard error decreased to 27.28. This performance surpasses that of the simple moving average.
Gnomial Functions Incorporated should use the weighted moving average to ascertain the probable sales level in the upcoming year. This approach is straightforward, efficient, and reliable. Moreover, it can be adjusted to mirror the alterations in sales patterns by modifying the coefficients to assign the necessary significance to the recent months. Therefore, the company should utilize the weighted moving average to evaluate the probable performance in the approaching year.
