A protein-restricted regimen involves the diminished intake of protein edibles that make up an individual's daily calories. This regimen is usually recommended to manage particular medical conditions like kidney and liver ailments. These edibles encompass eggs, nuts, salmon, chicken, and beef, which contain elevated protein levels (Suzuki et al., 2018). Consequently, a reduced intake of proteins is a dietary approach favored for geriatric patients given that their metabolism slows down in old age, suggesting that high-protein edibles could lead to weight gain and other ailments (Mirzaei et al., 2017). Therefore, a comprehensive nutritional teaching strategy on low protein consumption among geriatric patients is crucial in advocating a healthy lifestyle.
There are various hazards linked with aging, including weak immunity, unhealthy eating routines, and the recurrence of chronic medical conditions such as diabetes and hypertension. Moreover, as individuals age, their immune system decreases significantly due to the decreased production of the B and T cells that aid in combating illnesses when they arise (Suzuki et al., 2018). Similarly, elderly individuals are susceptible to developing imbalanced dietary patterns due to socio-economic factors such as a lack of a certified caregiver and finances to access healthier food selections. Additionally, the elderly endure degenerative conditions such as dementia, impacting their judgment and nutritional preferences (Mirzaei et al., 2017). Therefore, efficient training in self-management is crucial in facilitating change among this demographic. For instance, patient M is a 68years African American male diagnosed with polycystic kidney disease (Suzuki et al., 2018). He is reported to have been consuming half a pound of meat and three eggs daily. He mentioned that he adores his eggs and meat every day, and he feels content and pleased after having the meal.
When questioned about the hazards of his dietary routine, he mentioned nothing is incorrect with eating since proteins are the foundation of body tissues and muscles. As a retired bodybuilder, he still cherishes big muscles and maintains a high-protein diet to uphold his physique. Nonetheless, his reactions indicate an individual with information twisted from the reality. Therefore, considering his medical history and age, he must be placed on a low-protein diet as both variables expose him to health deterioration risks (Mirzaei et al., 2017). Furthermore, he necessitates training on the optimal dietary behaviors to sustain a healthy lifestyle.
Considering the elevated protein levels in his blood and the polycystic kidney disease, patient M should adopt the low-protein dietary scheme. Hence, the meat and eggs will be swapped with vegetables and grains like spinach and green peas. These plant-based proteins encompass wholesome compounds such as unsaturated fats and cholesterol that are benign to health. Nonetheless, the patient can still consume minimal quantities of meat and other grains and fruits to guarantee they receive sufficient calories required. An illustration is creating fried rice with 50grams of meat instead of the prior consumption range of 500grams daily (Mirzaei et al., 2017). This restricted protein ingestion will ensure that the blood is purified from surplus protein consumption.
The concise nutritional teaching plan, encompassing a meal transformation and concentrating on food constituents, will be presented utilizing nutritional videos and consistent brochures to encourage conscious eating. Meal transformation videos will educate the client on approaches to integrate their preferred plant-based recipes to ensure they adhere to the specified diet (Suzuki et al., 2018). For instance, African Americans enjoy soya and beans, which can be used in place of eggs and meat. The client will also be educated on how to decipher the nutritional label to make informed decisions. For example, the patient will comprehend that 100 calories per serving are advised and viewed as moderate through learning and exploration (Mirzaei et al., 2017). Consequently, anything exceeding that threshold has detrimental effects on health.
