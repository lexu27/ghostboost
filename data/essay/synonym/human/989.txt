In order to comprehend the arrangement and functions of society, it is crucial to explore a wide array of sociological theories and perspectives formulated by various scholars. For instance, Emile Durkheim, a French sociologist, articulated his perspective on society in the doctrine of functionalism. According to Durkheim, there is a crucial interconnectedness of all the components of any society that share mutual ideas and principles, and the aggregate of these components is not as significant as the society itself. The sociologist perceived society as a vast biological organism that necessitates all its segments to operate correctly to stay alive. Furthermore, when discussing collective and individual behavior, Durkheim mentioned that these two notions are entirely distinct, and there exists the collective conscience that induces people to adjust their deeds and behave in foreseeable manners. The notion of collective conscience is advantageous and constructive as it defines and assesses the standards of behavior.
However, not all sociologists hold the same standpoint on society. For instance, there is also a conflict theory advanced by Karl Marx. In contrast to functionalism, conflict theory perceives society as a structure with an ongoing class struggle, predominantly between the workers and the bourgeoisie. The primary reason for this struggle is the scarcity of resources and their uneven allocation, while its repercussions are linked to the imperative transformations taking place in society. Moreover, while functionalism concentrates on collectivism, social cohesion, and the necessity of behaving in comparable and foreseeable manners, Karl Marx stresses individualism and advocates alienation that separates an individual from society. Finally, whereas Durkheim asserted the capability of collective consciousness to bind people together and integrate them into society, conflict theory endeavored to eradicate false consciousness and substitute it with class consciousness.
It is apparent that functionalism and conflict theory are contradictory. They differ in nearly all concepts and ideas, encompassing the fundamental configuration of society. The principal objective of functionalism is to foster stability and ensure all constituents of society operate correctly to avert mistakes. Simultaneously, the chief aim of conflict theory is to underscore change because, without it, society cannot endure. Hence, it is entirely or nearly unfeasible to envision how these theories might complement each other.
