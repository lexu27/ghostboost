Morals as a System of Hypothetical Demands is a piece by Philippa Foot that endeavors to challenge Kantâ€™s concept of morals. Kant asserts that ethical evaluation cannot be a hypothetical demand; instead, it is a categorical and universal demand. Foot argues that morals should be portrayed as a system of hypothetical demands because morals do not vary from anything else, for instance, manners.
The notion of morals being guided by the categorical demands suggests that morals carry a different type of the term should. By contrasting morals with manners, Foot contends that there is no notable difference between the two (Foot, 1972). She provides an instance of an individual disregarding certain etiquette regulations is not excused for breaking them (Foot, 1972). Consequently, Foot deduces that as morals and manners can both employ categorical demands, the should of manners and the should of ethical evaluation are similar.
Subsequently, Foot proceeds to challenge the rationale behind adhering to the moral regulations. As per Foot (1972), a moral regulation can be unreasonable for an individual to adhere to, labeling this individual as amoral or wicked; nonetheless, not unreasonable. Hence, having the ability to refrain from adhering to these regulations for any reason, regardless of how it characterizes the individual, entails moral regulations are hypothetical demands, not categorical (Foot, 1972). Conversely, individuals can and do behave morally, even if not compelled to do so. Nevertheless, Foot concludes that if ethical evaluation is a hypothetical demand, then there must be other motives why individuals opt to remain moral (Foot, 1972). Such motives can be the hypothetical demand of longing for justice, benevolence, freedom, and other virtues.
