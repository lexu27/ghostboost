'Worldwide supplementation' alludes to a procedure that reorganizes manufacturing facilities from being local manufacturers of a product into having the capacity to produce the same item for overseas trade. This idea was initially witnessed during an emergency situation unfolding in a Toyota production facility in Thailand. Toyota vehicle sales plummeted by fifty percent within a month in local transactions. Toyota opted to renovate this facility into an export-oriented center. Although it was time-consuming, it led to a favorable result, with the Thailand facility capable of producing items for non-local transactions. Toyota representatives mentioned that if the facility was originally designed to switch between local and global transactions, the damage would be minimal.
The term ‘worldwide supplementation’ was coined by Toyota themselves and essentially can be defined as a tactic that converts outdated manufacturing facilities to be capable of transitioning between producing automobiles for local markets and fabricating for export. It emphasizes flexibility and adaptability while reducing the loss and time expense of overhauling facilities only after monitoring market fluctuations. Toyota themselves characterized the tactic as a crisis converted into an opportunity.
The tactic has several pros and cons. The tactic is a costly and time-intensive procedure as Toyota will need to revamp every facility they own globally to be ready for their setbacks in any market. If they persist in observing market downturns, their alteration of the facilities will be futile as there will be no demand for their products. Nevertheless, this tactic also enables facilities to keep operating instead of merely shutting down and consequently continue to offer employment and revenue. Moreover, the initial flexibility of new facilities can be advantageous in the long run.
