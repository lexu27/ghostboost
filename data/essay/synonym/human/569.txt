Preamble
The emergence of material and financial resources marks the initial and starting point of establishing an immeasurable and broad gap among various individuals. From now on, the globe has divided into “two factions,” and people are categorized not only by physical, individual, or intellectual traits but also by the notion of possessing specific advantages. Nowadays, there are both affluent and impoverished inhabitants in any nation, and at times the proportion between them is exceedingly distant. Nonetheless, every individual is equal, more or less reliant on each other as they exist in a community. Commitment is a crucial indication of a spiritually affluent, deeply and extensively contemplating individual who has not forfeited human and compassionate attributes.
Reaction to the Notions
The central concept and idea of the excerpt is self-assessment, commitment, and altruism, irrespective of the sum of money and the presence of valuable possessions. As per Andrew Carnegie, any affluence necessitates giving and contributing to those who require exceptional aid and backing. Everybody should acknowledge their virtues for the betterment of the entire society. Consequently, if the wealthy persist in prospering, neglecting the destitution of others, this will cause the whole society to deteriorate, and the wealthy themselves will also endure consequences. Certainly, affluent individuals should allocate a portion of their wealth to the impoverished. They are mandated to utilize their abilities and resources to combat poverty and assist underprivileged individuals in overcoming deprivation.
Certainly, the attainment of wealth, if not inherited, will demand a great deal of exertion and time. Nonetheless, this does not always bring about the desired contentment, and this realization usually occurs much later. Many persons, recognizing that wealth does not bring them joy, are unable to renounce their customary way of life. Hence, that is why it is prudent to discern what one genuinely desires. For instance, Carnegie comprehended that money is not an objective or even a means to attain it, but solely an accompanying attribute. Consequently, the man amassed the requisite sum to savor his time, not pursue money, revel in pleasure, relish the tranquil passage of days, and live for the moment.
Ending
To conclude, any good acquired by an individual necessitates commitment and loyalty. Some individuals lack the chance to possess adequate money and resources for a superior life due to external or internal factors. Unquestionably, Carnegie toiled diligently, but there is a substantial likelihood that the man arrived at the opportune moment and place. He realized in due time that wealth does not bring him joy, and one can derive happiness and satisfaction even simply through “small,” benevolent gestures – sharing and commitment.
