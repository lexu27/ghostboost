Before the eruption of COVID-19, Panama was one of the nations in Latin America and the Caribbean that had the most robust growth rate. Its growth performance escalated at an average rate of 4.7% between 2014 and 2019 before enduring severe harm from the pandemic, leading to its labor income being diminished by 18% in 2020 (Matus et al., 2021). Panama Solidario aided the nation in sustaining its poverty rate at 14.9% instead of the approximated 18.8%, indicating an increase from the original national poverty rate, which stood at 12.2% before the crisis (Matus et al., 2021). Panama's affluence primarily resides among the high-class individuals inhabiting urban areas, while those dwelling in rural regions are six times less affluent than the wealthier.

Globally, the joblessness rate surged significantly following the COVID-19 outbreak. Panama's joblessness rate ascended from 7.07% in 2019 to 18.55% in 2020, arising from the harm inflicted by the viral outbreak (O'Neill, 2021). In 2021, it amounted to 10.17%, a decline from 2020 (O'Neill, 2021). The United States encountered an employment rate of about 8.3% in 2021 (O'Neill, 2021). When comparing the unemployment rates of the two nations, it is glaringly evident that by 2020, Panama had a greater proportion of the workforce unemployed but actively seeking work in contrast to the US. Consequently, the US has a majority of its inhabitants employed, rendering Panama in a worse state.

Panama possesses its official currency, recognized as the Panamanian Balboa. It holds an identical value to the dollar; put differently, one dollar equals one Panamanian Balboa. Nonetheless, they do not produce their paper currency and instead employ the dollar as their legal tender. This dollar assimilation stemmed from its steadiness in value relative to the Balboa and its established exchange rate with their currency.

Panama maintains various trade relationships with several nations worldwide. Its primary trading associates consist of the US, China, Free Zones, and Singapore (Bakari & Mabrouki, 2017). The nation has enticed foreign investors due to its steady political setting, burgeoning real estate sector, and expanding economy (Bakari & Mabrouki, 2017). Panama recorded a trade shortfall valued at 5 billion dollars in 2020, demonstrating that the country's imports exceeded its exports. Its exports, denoted as a percentage of the GDP, stand at 40.74% (Matus et al., 2021). Overseas direct investment is pivotal for a nation as it generates employment prospects when investors institute new enterprises, thereby diminishing unemployment.

Concerning the unemployment and inflation rates in Panama, it is apparent that the nation harbors a stable growing economy. Despite the economic jolt of 2020 attributable to the COVID-19 dilemma, the nation succeeded in stabilizing its economic expansion. The Panamanian currency has contributed to the enlargement of its economy owing to its parity with the dollar value. Its service sector has amounted to over 75% of the GDP, propelling a substantial increase in recent years, influenced by the escalation in the value of one dollar (Matus et al., 2021). It is vigorously endeavoring to rejuvenate its economy by augmenting its labor force and wages.
