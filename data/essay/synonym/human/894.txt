With exponential expansion in intelligent device users, there is an uptick in the volume of data produced from various smart devices, which varies according to all the basic V’s used to categorize it as big data. Generally, most service providers, like Microsoft, Amazon, and Yahoo, have established a substantial number of geographically dispersed data centers to handle the vast amount of data produced by various smart devices to offer users swift response times. These service providers typically utilize Hadoop and SPARK for processing extensive datasets for this purpose (Chaudhary et al., 2018). Nonetheless, there has been less focus placed on the underlying infrastructure, which is one of the most critical aspects for the efficient completion of any specified solution in this context. I believe that cloud technology optimizes and streamlines many of the challenges presented in the business applications of big data. It largely resolves the issue of inadequate data storage capacity and ensures the infrastructure’s enhanced flexibility. Similarly, the data is simpler to backup through cloud solutions, enhancing the overall robustness of big data-related processes. The significance of big data in business cannot be overstressed. It assists in recognizing the target audience, conducting market research, and obtaining more accurate insights. Companies will be able to streamline corporate processes by integrating big data into their operations. Companies will be able to make decisions based on precise information, such as whether to invest in a product. Consequently, they will be able to evade making inefficient investments. Since the topic of Big Data and the cloud solutions for it becomes inevitable, it is crucial for the firms to adjust their existing infrastructures to the market demands sooner rather than later.
