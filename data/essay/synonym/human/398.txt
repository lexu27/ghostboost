The article’s main idea is backed by the additional reading writers exploring the instance of a peculiar alteration in Professor Wilson’s way of life. Indeed, the rationale behind such a choice was intricate, and it involves components of attaining utmost sustainability in the smallest area achievable. Moreover, the article notes that he imparts his encounters during the evenings when his ecology-focused students are welcomed to reside in the garbage can with him.
The article seized my attention with a few particulars. First and foremost, the situation where a esteemed academic lives in the garbage can reminded me of an Ancient Greek thinker Diogenes who resided in the barrel. Therefore, it was intriguing to delve into the subject and ascertain if there are any resemblances between the two. Furthermore, disclosing personal particulars and the personal history of the separated professor contributed a touch of psychological intrigue to it. I pondered if the separation impacts men so drastically that they are prepared for such a downgrade. But these are all unconscious musings and stimuli.
The visuals in the article were indispensable to me because I felt a bit fatigued when I commenced reading. Therefore, being able to scroll down and see the images of the garbage can, images of day-to-day tasks, and the inside of the garbage can was a way of unwinding and contemplating the topic. After viewing the images, I had some queries; hence, I had a personal stake in reading the article to uncover the responses. Frankly, the interior of the garbage can does not appear that unpleasant, and the best part is that Wilson is able to recline there comfortably. Therefore, on a personal level, residing in a garbage can is an alternative for occasions when I sense the need to be solitary. But the absence of amenities linked with the household kitchen and bathroom is why I could not opt for the garbage can as a site of my lasting dwelling.
