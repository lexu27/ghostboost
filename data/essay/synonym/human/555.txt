Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and Frankenstein are distinctive works regarding science and indeed, they share numerous similarities in terms of how the authors utilized science (Shelley; Stevenson). Producing pure evil from a monster created from a decaying body, evidently, two scientists were unaware of how science would evolve into a “terrifying” ordeal. This essay explores the works of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and Frankenstein in conveying messages about science and honesty, asserting that science is employed as a means for aggression.
Firstly, the majority of the scientists who initiated research did not witness the studies concluded as the contrast between the two scientists implied. Dr. Jekyll, for instance, finds Frankenstein’s myriad scientific experiments and observations intriguing despite his desertion. Significantly, both scientists’ initial responses to creation are quite explicit and conspicuously distinct. Another message conveyed by Frankenstein’s abandonment of a scientific experiment is that the realms of science and honesty have clear boundaries and limits. For instance, Frankenstein states, “My dreams were hence untroubled by reality; and I engaged with the utmost diligence in the pursuit of the philosopher’s stone and the elixir of life.” (Shelley, 65). A “supernatural creature can only grasp certain inherent concerns,” and contending with such forces will be frightening in itself. After breathing life into the “monster” Frankenstein crafted, a dreadful creature, the statement holds true.
There are self-centered motivations relating to the scientific experience in both works. Through the way he displays his admiration and amazement of his new scientific discovery, Henry Jekyll, unlike Frankenstein, is impelled by a sense of authority and overwhelming wickedness. He is not entirely truthful about his wish to create a human being to refute other biblical assertions. The manner in which the two scientists approach their research reveals much about their characters.
While both Jekyll and Hyde are enthusiastic about their scientific research, Frankenstein opts to abandon his project, deeming it an ill-conceived notion. In Jekyll and Hyde, it mentions, ““Utterson, I swear to God,” cried the doctor, “I swear to God I will never set eyes on him again. I bind my honor to you that I am done with him in this world. It is all at an end.”, indicating the acknowledgement of his actions (Stevenson, 123). The other two scientists (Jekyll and Hyde) are depicted as self-absorbed and egocentric, whereas Frankenstein is seen as a man of honesty who remains faithful to his principles and goals. Frankenstein also expresses more regret for commencing the experiment.
What is evident is the doctors’ lack of responsibility for their recklessness led to the deaths of innocent individuals. Both Frankenstein and Dr. Jekyll display this lack of honesty by concealing the truth about the extent of their experiments and by erasing most of the evidence of their respective scientific accomplishments. Some of the scientific experiments carried out by both Dr. Jekyll and Frankenstein are characterized by irrationality and sheer malevolence. Ultimately, both scientists had to admit that, despite their scientific knowledge and self-importance, they could not surmount some of life’s peculiar and incomprehensible conditions, such as creation.
The experiments aid in comprehending the scientific concepts and debates prevalent in the nineteenth century. Frankenstein is compelled to abandon his scientific inquiries into creation after realizing that he is transgressing certain laws of the universe and delving into the unknown. This lack of honesty is exemplified by the fact that both scientists overlook human nature in favor of conducting harmful and forceful experiments that dominate their consciences. The notion of creating a superior creature consumes their minds, and they act without contemplating the repercussions of their deeds.
Every scientific inquiry is essentially governed by extensive rules of ethics that are based on specific levels of honesty which were disregarded in both works. All research scientists must adhere to these ethical guidelines as a prerequisite for employment. Most of the ethical principles and honesty that govern scientific study are violated by Frankenstein and Dr. Jekyll. Any breach of such honesty will impact the outcomes of the experiments and the very essence of research. When the two scientists falsify evidence to achieve the desired outcome, their honesty is compromised. Instead of focusing on genuine and viable scientific discoveries, both Frankenstein and Dr. Jekyll solely strive to satisfy personal desires and ego. The two scientists surpassed the ethical boundaries of human scientific investigations in their quests to control human behavior and unveil the secret of creation and life.
The consequences are dire, as evidenced by the two scholars’ “dubious study,” exposing the horrifying aspect of the science employed. The two scientists, Frankenstein and Dr. Jekyll, seriously undermined the integrity of scientific study. Human experimentation violates integrity and scientific norms, despite the fact that Dr. Jekyll used himself as a subject in the experiment. Frankenstein’s use of human cadavers is also deemed a complete violation of scientific integrity. Most of Frankenstein’s and Dr. Jekyll’s scientific experiments were conducted covertly, with deliberate disregard for the potential harm to society. This scientific research, in and of itself, should serve as an example of what occurs when the integrity of science is questioned.
In conclusion, the themes of science and honesty in Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and Frankenstein are depicted from a perspective of “terrifying” as both led to a harrowing ordeal. There was a transgression of ethics in science, illustrating what may unfold if science is practiced by individuals who do not adhere to the principles of conduct and ethics. Therefore, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and Frankenstein demonstrate how science can become a potent tool for violence.
