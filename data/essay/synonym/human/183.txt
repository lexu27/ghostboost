Information gathering used to identify how to enhance the circumstances within a particular environment is highly significant. In the local health care environment, the utilization of real-life encounters with patients and oversight of a mentor, as the case manager, will be implemented. The information collected from treating the members of this community is used to evaluate the requirements of the health sector. This will involve; evaluating the current data using the patient information in the emergency department and applying the data to enhance the health sectors. One primary duty of caregivers is to aid in the prevention of illness, and intervention strategies should be concentrated on prevention rather than treatment. This article explains how a practicum agency can utilize evaluation data to enhance health conditions.
The necessity for evaluation data includes data on the history of illnesses reported, readiness of the health facility, and prevention measures by the community. This data should aid in identifying the most common illnesses, enhancing the preparedness within the health facility, and increasing disease prevention in the community. However, the requirements of patients differ from one another. A good illustration is a patient who arrives at the emergency department with asthma and expects their condition to be managed and provided with medications that will aid in stabilization (Stefaniak et al., 2018). This varies from a patient with malaria who will be treated and educated on preventive measures afterward. Individual patient evaluation needs differ from the community's needs. The data on health requirements encompass patient sickness with specific illnesses and the patients' advancement.
To prioritize the health requirements of patients, it may be crucial to have information on patients' conduct, surroundings, and genetic predisposition. A good instance is the asthma patient; the environmental conditions of the patient should be considered to prevent subsequent attacks (Iriarte‚ÄêRoteta et al., 2020). Another instance is a diabetic patient would benefit from data on lifestyle as their condition can be easily managed through their lifestyle.
The data from the practicum can establish a support system, expand screening facilities, and provide health education to the patients. The support system aids patients struggling with addiction, makes them feel welcomed by the community, and assists them in overcoming their habits. Screening facilities enable early detection and management of diseases at a primary or early secondary stage (Gillies & Schabath, 2020). Additionally, health education benefits the entire community in the prevention is better than cure initiative. Health professionals should prioritize disease prevention rather than treatment.
The practicum agency leveraged the existing data to enhance the outcome of their programs. Firstly, they collaborated with some health practitioners to establish an online platform where patients could engage with health providers and inquire about their health status (Yang et al., 2019). This aided in disease prevention and reducing overcrowding in consultations. Additionally, it decreased the consultation fee for those unable to afford it since consultations on this platform were complimentary. Secondly, the agency focused on advocating for health equity by pushing for the provision of health services for the less privileged. This was done by advocating for the construction of more health facilities and the recruitment of additional health providers to ensure that all individuals can access health services irrespective of their financial status.
During the practicum, I participated in community-based activities such as tending to the homeless, treating the uninsured members of the community, and educating community members on the significance of preventive health measures. During this period, I attended to a patient who had rheumatoid arthritis. Initially, I suspected the patient had rheumatic fever, but I comprehended how the clinical manifestations and diagnosis differed through mentor consultation. The patient with rheumatic arthritis is just one illustration of how the practicum enabled me to enhance critical thinking, clinical judgment, and clinical reasoning. Clinical judgment, critical thinking, and clinical reasoning are crucial elements for all health practitioners, from physicians to care providers. All care providers must be well-prepared to make sound clinical judgments.
My mentor and other community providers offered me an entirely new viewpoint on the population and their requirements. Through their expertise, I realized that the well-being of your patient is your utmost concern. One should do everything possible to ensure the patient departs for home content. I picked up on this through an incident where my mentor treated an insured patient against the hospital policy, stating that the administration would handle the remaining processes. His responsibility was to ensure his patient was treated and not to ascertain whether the patient was insured. Patients rely on healthcare providers to care for them properly and guide them to good health.
In conclusion, collaborating with the practicum agency and my mentor provided me with an experience that will be beneficial for me in my clinical practice and for meeting the needs of society. I learned how to evaluate community needs from individual to community-based assessments. Furthermore, I comprehended how assessment data can accomplish healthcare objectives and enhance the healthcare provision for a population. I anticipate more of such opportunities as they not only shape your academic life but transform your entire outlook on life.
