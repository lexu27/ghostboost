The proposed tactics to alleviate the impacts of COVID-19 following the instance of Iceland could be viewed as an intriguing approach. This plan recognizes its evident constraints, such as the endurance of the Iceland community, geographic peculiarity. However, presently, this plan might not be a viable technique to tackle the high percentages of infected individuals in NATO nations. It is indeed accurate that prompt action and elevated testing rates would help in preventing the repercussions caused by the sudden rise in the number of infected individuals. Nonetheless, it is equally crucial that the populace would be open to undergo such a measure. Additionally, despite the financial aid efforts, some nations affiliated with the organization might not be able to financially endure the substantial amount of testing mandated by the new surges of infection. This reality is particularly pertinent considering that the virus spread could occur simultaneously across multiple countries.

Hence, an alternative approach to the issue might be required. The Israeli government tackled the challenge of monitoring the infected with the innovative solution of digital epidemiological inquiry (Amit et al., 2020). This technology facilitated tracing potential contacts of infected individuals and responding accordingly (Amit et al., 2020). However, it can be debated that this methodology could tackle the geographic constraints introduced in the case of Iceland. It would be challenging for NATO nations to rigorously monitor all entries to their borders. Therefore, a counterpart in the shape of digital tracking might resolve the issue without the necessity for stringent border controls and offer essential resources for timely responses to new outbreaks. However, it would necessitate finances both internal and external to establish new or refurbish the existing infrastructure for the specified objectives.
