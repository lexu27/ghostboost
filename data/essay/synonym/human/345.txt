In every company, irrespective of the sector, the collected raw information requires arrangement, condensation, and presentation to transform the data into valuable knowledge. Evans and William (2014) demonstrate that statistics involves the understanding linked with data collection, arrangement, inspection, explanation, and demonstration. From a biblical viewpoint, statistics encompasses summing up and counting. In Numbers 1:2, the Lord instructed Moses to, “Take ye the total of all assembly of the children of Israel, after their lineages, by the household of their fathers, with the count of their names, every male by their polls” ( King James Bible , 2017). The authors further highlight that concerning Six Sigma, statistical comprehension is crucial as it aids in grasping potential data trends, designs, and alterations in a specific period (Evans and Williams, 2014). As a healthcare manager, this understanding is vital since it will help in comprehending how my organization compares its performance in relation to its competitors, business units, and best-in-class benchmarks while acknowledging the connection among different metrics.
Descriptive statistics illustrates how data is presented numerically and visually and may involve graphs, histograms, and frequency distributions in the organization and display of information. Database software like Access and Microsoft Excel facilitates how data can be condensed by every staff member (Evans and Williams, 2014). As a healthcare manager, the application of descriptive figures will be crucial as it assists in reducing the total time needed for patient admission, treatment, and release from the appropriate hospital department. Moreover, under my management, the utilization of such software will enable my subordinates to swiftly access patient details on the exact admission and discharge timings. That will greatly aid my subordinates in managing the seriousness of a patient’s health condition. Additionally, as Cox et al. (2014) indicate, through the implementation of the theory of constraints, alongside understanding statistical measures, healthcare facilities can also offer patients the necessary care and enhance their revenues. Therefore, under my management, the utilization of statistical measures will be crucial. This will be essential since it will allow my facility to provide its patients with prompt appointments, ensure efficiency in the rooming process, and facilitate seamless handovers.
The most crucial descriptive statistics and equations are average, median, method, and variation. Represented by the Greek symbol µ, average is a condensed representation of the entire dataset using a single number as the typical value (Kros and Rosenthal, 2016). Also known as the arithmetic mean, the average is also utilized to assess central tendency (Kros and Rosenthal, 2016). The Median represents the primary value or what is termed the 50th percentile (Evans and Williams, 2014). Under my management, the median value will be the central value where half the data will be below it, and the remaining half will be above it when the dataset is organized. Furthermore, in an odd number observation, my administration will display the median as the central number of the sorted numbers. In an even number observation, it becomes the mean of the two central numbers (Evans and Williams, 2014). When using Excel, the median value can be identified using the Excel function MEDIAN, which is the data span.
The most frequently occurring data is what constitutes the method. As a healthcare manager, the importance of the method value will lie in the realization that it comprises a relatively small number made up of unique datasets. In a set of numbers where recurring numbers are scarce, the practical value of method is also restricted. When using Excel, the function MODE.SNGL or MODE.MULT signifies the data span where the method value can be acquired (Evans and Williams, 2014). Lastly, variation is a scattering measure that is based on all data, and the greater the variation value, the more broadly distributed the data, and the more variability can be observed. However, this value cannot be provided using Excel and, therefore, can only be computed manually.
