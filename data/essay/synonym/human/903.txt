In Plato’s literary piece, there are three responses to what piety represents. Euthyphro commences with a lesser significance of righteousness. Nevertheless, Socrates, in accordance with his overall perspective, consistently emphasizes a broader meaning of the term. This is due to his lesser inclination toward correct traditions as opposed to moral existence. Consequently, the initial response to the query about piety indicates that Euthyphro’s piety is what he is executing presently, which involves accusing his father of homicide. Euthyphro provides such an explanation of piety and impiety as what satisfies divine entities.
Conversely, what they detest and do not acknowledge as virtuous is impious. Moreover, Socrates disapproves of Euthyphro’s action since it merely serves as an example of piety and does not establish a fundamental defined attribute that renders the proper action pious (Plato, 2021). It is crucial to recognize that divine entities vary in numerous aspects. Thus, it can be inferred that there are multiple things that divine beings concurrently cherish and disdain.
At a particular instance, Euthyphro is caught off guard, prompting Socrates to recall the explanations he previously provided. He mentioned that the deities adore something because it is pious, signifying that their adoration stems from an inherent quality in the pious. Socrates argues that the endorsement of the gods is simply an aspect of a particular sentiment and that divine endorsement does not constitute a defining attribute. Consequently, Euthyphro is the sort of priest who seeks to unravel the main query. Nonetheless, Socrates dismisses each definition of piety that he presents. Following all the futile endeavors, Euthyphro swiftly departs and leaves the query unresolved.
