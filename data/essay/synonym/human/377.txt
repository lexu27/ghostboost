Janina’s dialect in the novel Drive Your Plow over the Bones of the Dead is distinct in numerous ways, as she unveils the enigma encircling not only the slayings but her character. Nevertheless, one of the most remarkable characteristics that the reader may detect on the initial page is Janina’s utilization of aliases as replacements for any individual or creature’s title. While many individuals use aliases for companions or individuals they despise, Janina’s strategy is constructed on her sentiments concerning her title and titles in general. She asserts, “I believe each of us sees the other person in our way, so we should provide them with the title we deem appropriate.” She regards titles as “polyonymous” and adheres to this principle for every figure she encounters.
Consequently, every individual that Janina converses with or mentions is metamorphosed into the attribute she perceives in them. Her companion is Oddball – and from the outset, the reader must inherently acknowledge that this individual might be peculiar in some manner, though it might not be precise. Likewise, the slaying victims – Big Foot, Commandant, Inner – must be perceived as the characteristics of appearance or stature they possess in Janina’s perspective. Conversely, when Janina contemplates a title for a rescued canine, her initial notion is a human title, Marysia. She rebuffs other pet titles, stating that “considering her personal history” they could not be fitting for the dog. Thus, Janina ruminates deeply on the creature’s existence and dilemmas, founding the title on the canine’s state and tale.
By examining the disparity between titles and aliases that Janina employs for individuals and creatures, one can discern her genuine principles. She adores creatures while humans are evaluated or excluded for their peculiarity. Consequently, while the storyteller is unreliable, she swiftly discloses her opinions on the slayings and unveils her prospective part in them. Her disposition is to assess individuals for their treatment of creatures, and the latter is perceived as superior, more deserving of rescue than humans.
