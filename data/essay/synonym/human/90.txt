Diverse societies across the globe possess distinct creation myths and customary ways of portraying them through art. The cosmogony of the Aztec empire differed significantly from the Europeans who vanquished them. Initially, the Europeans' Christian Deity "formed humanity in his own likeness" and bestowed upon him authority over a flawlessly constructed universe, the Garden of Eden (Holy Bible, New International Version, Genesis 1:27). In the Bible, he is depicted as a kind, albeit stern, paternal figure who has the capacity to pardon humans for their transgressions and offer them everlasting redemption. Consequently, God is illustrated in art as a knowledgeable, elderly man with a beard and silver hair. Christian art predominantly extols the potency of His clemency and the abundant environment that He formed.
In comparison, Aztec genesis tales are grounded on disassembled deities, and therefore the beginning of the universe is marked by catastrophic brutality, which clarifies why Aztec art portrays divinity as horrifying and breathtaking (National University, 2022). Their art serves as a caution and a directive to comply. They require blood as a trade for nourishment, and every statue of the deities in Aztec society features a vessel for human hearts (National University, 2022). Unlike Christianity, the central entity is a female deity, but resembling Eve, she is essentially a passive participant whom the other deities penalize. Moreover, Coatlique's decision to give birth a second time against her offspring's desires could also be viewed as the Aztec variation of Eve's act of defiance.
Both Aztec and Christian deities are portrayed as flawless and self-sufficient. Nevertheless, in the Aztec mythology, deities transcend the notions of righteousness and malevolence, whereas in the Christian hierarchy malevolence is deemed the realm of Satan and the antithesis of God. Consequently, Aztecs must pacify a bloodthirsty, ferocious goddess to obtain sustenance and endure. Conversely, Christians must renounce transgression and yield their soul to God to secure eternal deliverance. Ultimately, the Christian creation narrative is grounded on absolution and affection in contrast to the Aztecs' endurance through brutality, and this contrast is mirrored in their divergent artistic approaches.
