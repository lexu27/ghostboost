Text: Foreword
The biographical movie ‘ Prior to Dusk Falls’ impacts the most sensitive cords of its spectators’ soul, portraying the tragic and adversity-filled life of the renowned Cuban poet Reinaldo Arenas. The individual was brought up in a low-income family and resolved to aid the Cuban revolutionaries who valued his skill as a writer. Simultaneously, he abruptly chose to issue a nationwide plea about his non-traditional orientation. Nonetheless, his former acquaintances and comrades, with the celebrated Fidel Castro at the forefront, succeeded in enacting a law prohibiting homosexuality and jointly imprisoned the young man. For a full two years, he served his term in a Cuban penitentiary and devised strategies for a new brighter future. After his release, Reinaldo Arenas drastically alters his plans and flees to America. Despite finding genuine affection there, the harmony concluded with an illness. Therefore, it is crucial to determine whether Reinaldo himself selected his sexual orientation or if it was influenced by various circumstances.
Societal and Cultural Influences on the Sexual Orientation
Despite evidence of homosexuality existing in ancient Greece, society has long viewed it as unethical. Freud’s works in this domain elucidate the protagonist’s sexual inclination towards his own gender (Gibson et al. 37). In this manner, the philosopher posited that hindrances or the incapacity to navigate a specific life stage contribute to the development of homosexuality (Gibson et al. 37). The protagonist of the film endured a childhood in poverty and devoid of a father figure. Even when a tutor visited the residence to commend the boy’s literary talents, his grandfather became greatly irked (Schnabel). Concurrently, spectators might discern that Reinaldo Arenas observed men bathe unclothed for the first time. The primary character grinned and gazed at the men’s physiques with inquisitiveness. Hence, it is plausible to establish a correlation between the familial issues and Reinaldo’s as yet unidentified longings. At the same time, Freud contended that inherent sexual deviations could not impact an individual autonomously (Gibson et al. 38). They were incited by societal influences, of which there were also numerous in the central character’s life.
The prohibition and persecution of homosexuals and apprehensions also intensified Reynaldo Arenas’ sexual impulse. Notably, even while incarcerated, he believed he could emerge liberated and advocate for gay rights (Schnabel). Carpenter noted that members of the artistic community, such as authors, actively championed homosexual rights (Gibson et al. 39). He posited that liberties and entitlements are invaluable for such individuals, and they are prepared to fight for them. Reinaldo Arenas also sensed oppression and endeavored to restore equity in his writings. He chronicled the regime's battle against homosexual individuals, although Reinaldo could only publish overseas. Consequently, the main character’s heightened sense of justice and equality, captivated by cultural luminaries, adversely impacted his life. He was persecuted due to the prohibited books he authored, censored and detained as an especially perilous offender (Schnabel). Thus, the concepts expounded signify that Reinaldo Arenas was inclined towards homosexuality owing to the societal circumstances of his existence, and his literary flair contributed to the articulation of dissent and the aspiration to live freely.
The Protagonist’s Deliberate Decision
It is intriguing that the main character evaluated the repercussions of his actions and comprehended that he would face retribution. He persisted in writing and did not conceal his homosexuality, even as the authorities fervently pursued gay individuals. Reinaldo Arenas engaged in homosexual gatherings and frequented public venues with gay companions (Schnabel). Such conduct seems inappropriate, given that the protagonist feared repercussions and sought to safeguard his life. Consequently, it could be contended that he deliberately selected this comportment and its consequences. According to religious doctrines, intimate relations between individuals of the same sex warrant punishment. For instance, Leviticus notes that engaging in such adultery entails capital punishment (Gibson et al. 7). Hence, religious doctrines do not endorse homosexuality as a natural occurrence or instigated by societal factors. Instead, they deem it a display of sexual licentiousness and a specific individual choice.
From this perspective, Reinaldo Arenas opted for a problematic destiny for himself when he disclosed his involvement in homosexuality. Furthermore, he engaged in numerous sexual liaisons with diverse partners, indicating an unethical lifestyle that spurred the onset of AIDS (Schnabel). Therefore, religious precepts cast doubt on the protagonist’s conduct and affirm that he made a conscious decision. Though the Bible recounts a close bond between David and Jonathan, certain scholars interpret this as a manifestation of homosexuality (Gibson et al. 7). Accordingly, the assertion that individuals are inherently oriented traditionally and that homosexuality is a personal decision one can challenge. Thus, even this exegesis of scripture by scholars elucidates that one does not intentionally elect homosexuality.
Epilogue
Hence, Freud would contend that societal factors shaping an individual’s development as a person can influence sexual orientation. The unfavorable circumstances of Reinaldo Arenas’ formative years and adolescence might have contributed to the emergence of a non-traditional sexual orientation. Concurrently, Reinaldo’s literary aptitude emboldened him to resist the regime and society. That is why he persevered in writing books and openly affirmed his gay identity. It was these diverse reasons that culminated in the premature demise of the main character after enduring considerable tribulations. The biblical argument that sexual orientation is an individual’s choice can be refuted as some scholars maintain that scripture illustrates homosexual relationships. Thus, the protagonist’s non-traditional orientation arose from a confluence of factors that ultimately led to his premature death.
