Preamble
Individuals uphold good health through practices like consuming well-rounded meals. Expectant mothers require optimal nourishment not just for themselves, but also for their unborn infants as well. The phase shortly before a child's birth is known as the prenatal period, where mothers are advised to consume nutritious meals to ensure the growth and birth of a child. Healthcare professionals consider nourishment as one of the key elements that contribute to a successful child birth. As per Clark (2020), consuming a well-balanced diet will supply nutrients for both the mother and the child. Nevertheless, women are still vulnerable to malnutrition behaviors influenced by various factors such as income level, knowledge, and medical history. This article explores the risk elements of age, cultural, lifestyle, socio-economic, and dietary challenges during the gestation phase.
Dietary Risk Elements
Age-linked Element: Adolescent
The age of an expectant mother can significantly influence the dietary patterns. Young females, particularly under the age of 20, are linked with inadequate eating routines (Nana & Zema, 2018). Stickler asserts that teenage mothers face greater risks compared to those above 20. Pregnant mothers necessitate a range of vitamins and minerals vital for both personal and fetal development. Adolescents tend to prefer snacks and high-starch foods like fries, leading to an imbalance in their nutrient intake. Adhering strictly to a dietary regimen would be more challenging for a teenager than for an older woman around 30 years of age. Since nutrients are not inherently produced, they must be acquired through food consumption. A deficiency in nutrients occurs when the body does not receive adequate nourishment (Nana & Zema, 2018). Adolescent mothers face dangers like low birth weight and premature birth due to poor dietary habits in the prenatal period.
