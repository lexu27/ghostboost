Studying Emily Dickinson’s verses is one of the most engrossing and demanding duties for many learners. On one side, she presents a range of intriguing topics that enrich human existence and inspire in her concise poems. Conversely, the blend of peculiarity and self-control perplexes. There exist twelve lines in her “I Died for Beauty,” yet each phrase conveys a note about the poet’s concerns and literary contributions. Necessity, life-long aspirations, and discord are the three topics in Dickinson’s poem that are aptly communicated through the symbolism of truth and beauty.
Demise is the sole aspect that remains unavoidable in human existence despite multiple efforts to dodge or delay it by various methods. Dickinson introduces two orators who passed away due to different causes but comparably “adjusted in the tomb… in an adjoining room” (lines 2, 4). The poet employs such a dreadful but anticipated conclusion when an individual departs this world to underscore humans’ parity before nature and the reality that death terminates most individuals’ abilities to converse, desire, or act (Dahami 256). There is no necessity to contemplate accomplishment, wisdom, or affluence because the result, an empty sepulcher, is identical for all.
Another notable facet of the poem is the recognition of enduring aims and potentials. As per Dickinson, individuals might perish with two notions in thought, either for beauty or truth (lines 6-7). These two ideas are so dissimilar and akin simultaneously, affirming her perpetual endeavor for spiritual triumph (Sharma 103). The discussion between the proponents of truth and beauty is not a dispute but a contribution to Dickinson’s maturity in comprehending the core of existence and the correctness of demise. These two allegories split society into two factions who might strive for something practical and beloved, like beauty, or seek something incomprehensible but crucial, like truth. The poem illustrates that individuals are free to establish and select distinct aims during their lifetimes, concentrating on their concerns and desires.
Lastly, in her straightforward and unassuming conversation, Dickinson appears to be troubled by the circumstances that give rise to discord in interpersonal connections. There is no necessity to possess a real adversary to be in conflict. Nonetheless, the contention between the existing appearances and essence is noticeable in her poem (Sharma 103). Human existence requires conflicts to be whole and equitable, and the author aids the reader in identifying the origins of queries and disparities. One speaker perishes for beauty but discovers that it is scarce, and another speaker appreciates the opportunity to perish for truth but realizes that it does not alter faith. The identical conclusion and emptiness “covered up our names,” without affording an opportunity to safeguard and immortalize the identity (Dickinson line 12). Although this poem is not centered on discord, this subject reinforces the comprehension of the narrative.
Dickinson prospers in utilizing multiple potent techniques and words to exhibit how poetry should penetrate the human psyche. Her “I Died for Beauty” is not merely a dialogue between two individuals who lived and perished but a fusion of hope, wisdom, and consequence. This meticulous examination is an opportunity to perceive how Dickinson approached existence and embraced death through the lens of personal aims and complete conflicts. Inevitability is never unambiguous, and it is a duty of individuals to live and learn and be prepared for death not due to something purposeful but for something everlasting.
