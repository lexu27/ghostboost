One practical way to commute is utilizing personal means of transport rather than public transport. Urban planning and development complicate public transportation in the manner transportation functions, leading to a lack of understanding of its operation. As depicted in the video, there is a disconnection between public transportation and destinations (Vox, 2020). The root cause for this disconnection is the layout with which the road network was constructed. Public transportation was devised to aid individuals in commuting from outer areas towards the cities and vice versa. Consequently, the interstate journey was not considered when designing public transportation. Most research indicates that the majority of Americans nowadays commute amid suburban pathways that are not covered by the public transit system (Vox, 2020). This not only gave rise to the car culture but also rendered it arduous to travel between suburbs on foot once public transportation reaches the intended destination. Furthermore, the actuality of utilizing public transport service involves the matter of personal space. Evans and Wener (2006) contend that public transportation is more about crowding and its failure to encapsulate passengers' encounters in any given area. The issue of social interaction intensifies with congestion, leading to unforeseeable and unfavorable encounters. With a lack of recognition for the individual commuter and how to transition between suburbs, public transportation renders it less convenient to utilize when traveling within the suburbs. A considerable degree of tension is linked to public transportation resulting in a dearth of seclusion (Evans & Wener, 2006). The experience is exacerbated, notably during peak hours, where physical contact escalates with the movement among travelers. There needs to be alterations in how the government strategizes for this method of travel to utilize public transportation, and the responsible organizations must ensure dependability in how communities are linked. There needs to be a flexibility with which buses travel between suburbs, enabling accessibility. Furthermore, time intervals in how the buses reach the localities are also crucial. For instance, investing in primary operations to enhance fundamental functions is pivotal in achieving superior results in Toronto. Government funding for endeavors related to enhancing public transportation would significantly contribute to how the mode of transportation will be revamped. The primary challenge with public transportation is, as established, the absence of seclusion. With the extended distances covered on foot after using trains and buses, public transportation results in more tension than personal vehicles. Therefore, reevaluating the foundations of public transportation and reorganizing how the system facilitates inter-suburb travel is a pivotal objective that must be achieved to enable equivalent levels of convenience as personal vehicles. The government must first alter its viewpoint on public transportation by examining it from a communal service rather than from a capitalist standpoint. This would entail more investment in operations from an alternative perspective on how the sector would benefit the populace. Rearranging train and bus stops to lessen the walking distance between stops and workplaces is essential. Currently, this distance is estimated to be 45 minutes, and altering it to, let's say, between five and ten minutes, would significantly enhance my ability to utilize public transportation. The level of convenience would increase, possibly surpassing that of personal transportation, signifying a change in priorities regarding the modes of transportation employed.
