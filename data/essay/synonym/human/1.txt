The 2013 movie 12 Years a Slave demonstrated that bondage is a global concern. Indeed, the film generated $150 million internationally and $57 million in the U.S., with a production cost of $20 million (Sharf, 2020). The film was adapted from the autobiography Twelve Years a Slave by Solomon Northup (Ntim, 2020). It recounts the tale of a liberated African American man who was abducted and traded into servitude. Solomon endured twelve years apart from his family, being exchanged from one owner to another. Fortunately, the main character encountered an individual who assisted him in sending a message to his family and friends, who then arrived and rescued him. This film accurately portrays discriminatory interactions between white slave owners and black slaves that originated from the dysfunctional system in the nation and biases in peopleâ€™s mindsets during that era.

The two primary ethnicities depicted in this movie are Caucasian and African Americans, and the three societal sectors are wealthy slave owners, laboring for the middle class, and enslaved individuals. The film commences with the narrative of a liberated African American musician Solomon Northup, residing with his family in Saratoga, New York (McQueen, 2013). However, he was kidnapped by two Caucasian individuals, who tormented the man and traded him into servitude, altering his name to Plat. Prior to this encounter, Solomon and these two slave traders belonged to the same middle class. Nevertheless, Northup's African American descent led these individuals to believe they had the authority to strip away his liberty. The two masters that Solomon served under were William Ford and Edwin Epps (McQueen, 2013). The former was benevolent and devout, while the latter was harsh and sadistic. As the film was inspired by a true account, it indicated that slave owners had diverse personalities, yet all harbored the incorrect racial perceptions.

While 12 Years a Slave primarily addresses slavery, it also brings up the themes of collectivism and individualism. Specifically, the protagonist never viewed himself as an enslaved individual and persisted in asserting he was a free citizen (McQueen, 2013). Nevertheless, his peers on the plantation possessed a collective mentality instilled in them since childhood, deeming slavery as customary. These individuals supported each other due to their shared identity. Despite Solomon's efforts to integrate into this community, his personal objective of returning home surpassed the collective principles.

The film also highlighted bias, stereotypes, generalizations, and bias against black individuals. For example, when Ford brings Solomon and Elisa to his estate, his wife expresses sorrow that Elisa was separated from her children. Nonetheless, she also remarked that providing "something to eat and some rest" could help that woman forget her children (McQueen, 2013, 32:47-32:51). This scene exhibited the prevalent bias regarding slaves, suggesting they lacked the same emotions as white individuals. An instance of generalization and stereotyping was how Tibeats, a carpenter, turned hostile towards Solomon when he displayed his intellect and offered Ford advice. In truth, Tibeats believed that Plat would never surpass any white person in competence because Plat was a "nigger" (McQueen, 2013, 36:35-36:37). Remarkably, before Northup was enslaved, he had never encountered bias; however, after being sold into servitude, discrimination became the prevailing attitude he encountered.

In essence, 12 Years a Slave portrays the existence of enslaved persons and slave owners nearly two centuries back. The film recounts the life of a liberated black man from the moment he relished his family's companionship in the state of New York to his abduction, enslavement, and eventual emancipation. Overall, the movie addressed crucial topics such as discrimination, bias, stereotyping, and generalization that enabled slave owners to uphold this societal framework for an extended period.
