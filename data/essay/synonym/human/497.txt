Price packaging is a specific tactic utilized by merchants to enhance sales, get rid of less prosperous products, and enhance customer allegiance. It suggests the vending of numerous items at increased margins collectively, granting customers a reduction simultaneously (Baldwin, 2020). In simpler terms, through price packaging, various disparate products are presented as a bundle, which is lower than the costs for each product if purchased individually. It is evident that this tactic influences customer conduct as individuals favor bundles driven by their prices, particularly when all encompassed items are appealing. There exist several instances of price packaging, notably in the food sector. Consequently, various fast-food chains, such as McDonald’s, Burger King, and KFC, provide combo meals that are more economical compared to the total of included items’ prices.
