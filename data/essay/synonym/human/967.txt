Chemerinsky, Erwin, and Michele Goodwin. “Constitutional Gerrymandering against Abortion Rights: Nifla V. Becerra.” New York University Law Review , vol. 94, no. 1, 2019, pp. 1-124.
This article, published by two professors of law, discusses abortion rights as they pertain to informing women about contraception and abortion. The article’s primary point, depicted by recent cases, is that the conservative Supreme Court will likely persist in infringing upon abortion rights using very comprehensive interpretations of the Constitution. It may be beneficial in the paper because the authors cite significant statistics concerning abortion to bolster their point. The source’s efficacy lies in utilizing statistical data to reinforce its point, but the author’s evident bias in support of abortion rights may be viewed as a drawback.
Erdman, Joann an. “Theorizing Time in Abortion Law and Human Rights.” Health and Human Rights Journal , vol. 19, no. 1, 2017, pp. 29-40.
This article by a specialist in health law and policy examines the issue of abortion from health and justice perspectives. The author contends that specific terms for permitting or prohibiting abortion are mainly arbitrary, and the primary focus should be tending to the health and rights of women rather than enforcing any strict standard. The article scrutinizes numerous instances of legal temporal limitations to tightly support its point, but its limitation is that it does not suggest specific approaches for addressing pregnant women’s rights and health. It would be most effectively used to provide information on how abortion laws perceive health risks.

This article by two researchers from the Guttmacher Institute, a prominent abortion advocacy organization, addresses the rates of abortion in the United States. The authors’ technique involved cross-referencing several databases, and their inference is that there is a noticeable but not consistent decline in abortion rates. The abundance of statistical information is the source’s primary asset and also the most effective way to utilize it in the paper. Its primary drawback is rhetorical as the authors’ association signals a bias in favor of abortion.
Rebouche, Rachel. “Abortion Rights as Human Rights.” Social & Legal Studies , vol. 25, no. 6, 2016, pp. 765-782.
This article by a lawyer from Temple University argues that a human rights viewpoint may lessen the legal challenges of enforcing abortion rights. It upholds this central point by discussing how the escalating prominence of the human rights perspective weakens institutional barriers against abortion rights. It would be optimally employed to illustrate the argument in support of abortion rights based on the pregnant women’s right to health, which is its major strength.
Thomson, Judith J. “A Defense of Abortion.” University of Colorado , Web.
This article, authored by a notable feminist thinker for everybody interested in the subject, refutes philosophical arguments against abortion. By employing robust thought experiments, which constitute its primary strength, the article demonstrates that arguments against abortion grounded on the fetus’s right to live do not endure criticism. It is best utilized according to its strengths to illustrate mainstream logical arguments for and against abortion, and its only drawback is that it is relatively old, but its logic does not really age.
