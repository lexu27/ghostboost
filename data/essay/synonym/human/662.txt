The lawsuit narrates an elderly lesbian biracial couple Ruth and Janice. They have been cohabiting for 42 years in a tiny town in a Southern state. Nonetheless, because of a car crash, Ruth endured a life-threatening condition and now the couple encounters a difficulty that involves complexities in the various aspects of life. As Ruth must undergo long-term nursing care through Medicare and Medicaid, the couple faces a financial problem linked with healthcare. Additionally, during the procedure, Ruth and Janice had to tackle problems linked with their identity of being a lesbian biracial couple. This encompassed issues with internalized homophobia and institutional heterosexism.
After leg and shoulder surgeries, Ruth was positioned in the nursing facility, where the couple faced initial complications, such as a heterosexual prejudice of workers, and the documents, which had to be completed, did not acknowledge the long-term lesbian relationship as an option. Consequently, there was no lawful manner in which Janice could be lawfully recognized as Ruthâ€™s official next of kin. This reality and the context of concealing their private life led the couple to hide the truth that they were in long-term intimate relationships with the personnel. Nevertheless, Janice brought clothes and personal belongings to Ruth and stayed in her room daily, which raised worries among the nurses who treated her with coldness.
The subsequent challenge was financial and property concerns. Since Ruth and Janice could not marry legally in this state, such a life-threatening circumstance left them susceptible to the loss of property due to the demise of one of the women. Therefore, they had to discover substitute solutions to guarantee that the residence they shared would belong to one of them after the demise of their partner. On the whole, the case mirrors how vulnerable sexual minorities can be and how many more hindrances and challenges they face to obtain what is deemed a standard for heterosexual individuals. The emotional burden of a life-threatening accident was amplified by the internalized homophobia experienced by the personnel and anxieties concerning the absence of legal confirmation of their relationships. Fortunately, Joseph was able to assist Ruth and Janice to find resolutions to their challenges and shield them from institutional heterosexism through prompt intervention.
