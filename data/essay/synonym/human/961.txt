The distinctive connection theory was formulated in 1939 by the seasoned sociologist Edwin Sutherland. The research elucidates how forbidden behaviors taught in social institutions can result in criminology. Numerous individuals understand the attitudes, techniques, and rationales for unlawful practices by engaging with diverse individuals. As stated by Lokanan (2018), individuals can reduce fraud-related incidents by grasping the theory to achieve favorable outcomes in establishments like schools. Scholars in high school interact with different individuals who exhibit offensive behaviors, and transgressions arise during this phase.
In my high school era, my peers and other elder students misused substances that posed a significant risk to their well-being. The consumption of alcohol and cocaine was deemed a vital custom by most circles as they could obtain the substances from the drug vendors in the closest town. The drug peddlers used to frequent the school to vend substances to the addicted students within the school premises. Throughout my academic journey, addicted students would hurry to restrooms to smoke, inject cocaine, and imbibe alcohol repeatedly. These actions occurred since the learners’ guardians could provide funds to the students, enabling them to acquire the substances.
Substance misuse can result in adverse outcomes such as poor educational achievement, health issues like brain disorders, and criminal activities in society. The substances ingested alter the brain functions through recurrent use, which influences the individual’s genetic makeup (Fernàndez-Castillo et al., 2021). Drugs like cocaine have profound impacts on individuals’ lives and, if taken excessively, can lead to fatality. Some individuals are genetically predisposed to developing cocaine addiction more than others.
Groups in high school who abused substances perpetrated offenses and were incarcerated in different correctional institutions. Misbehavior is a consequence of substance transgression where educators and parents should adopt new strategies to address the issue. Providing education centered in schools to the young populace is one of the suggested approaches to diminish the use and abuse of substances in academic settings (Montgomery et al., 2022). Educational interventions in schools can enhance cognitive-behavioral competencies and reduce exposure to societal pressures that promote substance abuse.

Parents should ensure their offspring have the essential requirements by involving them in school-based education and extracurricular activities such as sports to prevent misdeeds.
The strategy expounds on how individuals should comprehend the aim of reducing deceit in social arenas. The application of the material is a pivotal means to curb the conduct and enhance the student’s performance by providing health instruction. Parents and instructors should fulfill their duties effectively by taking measures such as disciplining the students who bully others or transgress during their high school years. Culture has also influenced young people to join organized factions where many juveniles have perished. It is imperative to enlighten the youth about the repercussions of transgression and substance misuse to lessen the conduct in society. Education can assist young individuals in gaining impetus by acquiring appropriate skills during their academic life and making rational choices.
