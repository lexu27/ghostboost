The article presents a summary of different literature on methods and standards employed in supplier assessment and choice process, which is considered a crucial element of a successful operation of a manufacturing company. Specifically, the paper highlighted the industry’s shift in this area – from concentrating mainly on operational effectiveness to embracing the potential of strategic alliances. The article argues that the correct approach to evaluating suppliers is therefore essential for a company’s growth and advancement.

The document commences with various strategies to tackle the problems connected to MCDM of suppliers’ selection. The most prevalent ones are claimed to be mathematical models, Simple multi-attribute rating technique (SMART), analytic network process (ANP), analytic hierarchy process (AHP), data envelopment analysis (DEA), linear programming, and other methods. For instance, DEA is a technique concentrated on a supplier system and categorizes it either as efficient or inefficient based on choosing specific criteria. Mathematical programming models typically involve intricate assessments among suppliers, enabling one to compare them and recognize the most optimal in terms of cost and other standards.

The article further contrasts all methods by their popularity indicated in the frequency of references in the literature. Hence, DEA is the most widespread approach with 30% references, while mathematical programming (17%), AHP (15%), and case-based reasoning account for fewer references. Nevertheless, those methods constitute the largest portion of all MCDM techniques.

The article underscores the importance of understanding this distribution, which can provide insight into the most dominant ways to handle the issues with suppliers’ assessment and selection. It is also mentioned that suppliers should be assessed based on “the inputs of the strategic, functional and operational levels” (Agarwal et al., 2011). Techniques such as DEA, mathematical programming, or AHP are recommended for identifying the most optimal suppliers, whereas AHP is recognized to be effective in ensuring consistency.
