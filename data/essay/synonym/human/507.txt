The champions of A New Hope are idealized pale characters. Amidala’s roles and extraterrestrial female characters, such as Twi’lek women, also emphasize greatly on the sensual aspects and stereotypical desires of women across ethnicities. Amidala introduces yet another pale performer donning an Asian outfit, while the Twi’leks symbolize the sensual dominance of diverse ethnicities as symbols of status. These instances validate Berg’s (2009) theory that stereotypes are employed with strict reasoning and are oversimplified generalizations.
Nevertheless, racial and gender aspects are reimagined in subsequent sections of the movie. Finn is significant as a dark-skinned individual who was ethical and brave, not inherently untrustworthy and dishonest like Lando Calrissian. Rei also embodies a notable and favorable progression of Star Wars female protagonists. Instead of being confined by a pale woman’s eroticized or defenseless stereotype, she is self-reliant, courageous, seasoned, and robust. Hence, it can be presumed that the stereotypes exhibited in the initial Star Wars movies were not utilized for racist and sexist intentions but were depicted unknowingly.
