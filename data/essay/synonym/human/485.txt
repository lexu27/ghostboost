Most of the individuals in need of incubation tend to exhibit ventilation changes. For this reason, they tend to undergo bronchial secretion, which can complicate their progression if not properly managed. Associated issues can result in mucus blockages, atelectasis, and sometimes, super-infection, which promote the emergence of nosocomial pneumonia. Research has not specified how the procedure should be carried out on adults with endotracheal intubation. However, the institutionâ€™s protocols must be adhered to and confirm that the patients necessitate aspirations based on the secretion observations in the airways. Coughing efforts, restlessness, breathlessness, snoring, and anxiety are respiratory signs of dysfunction. In this context, patients must be questioned about whether they believe aspiration is necessary.
The situation illustrates a lack of appropriate guidelines on the correct treatment intervention for pneumonia patients. For this reason, a suitable treatment strategy must be implemented and conveyed to all nursing professionals. To demonstrate the impact of saline infusion and its absence on the pneumonia risk, the subsequent detailed plan is crucial:
