Chapter 3. India. Women of Mughal Empire
In this section of the book Women in Global History, the Mughal dominion and its repercussions for women in conquered territories are examined. The primary idea introduced in this text is the element of bondage. Non-Muslims were permitted to be enslaved in accordance with Islamic decrees, so for women, servitude posed a greater danger than being coerced to adhere to an alien faith and lifestyles. Because of famines, numerous women were traded into servitude or captured to be auctioned off far from their homesteads.
During that period, bhakti, an artistic movement of female poet-saint, commenced. Bhakti signifies "devotion", thus this category involves spiritual subjects such as renunciation of pedantry, repudiation of asceticism, and intensities of personal dedication. This method of self-expression knew no limits, and its adherents (numerous of whom were women) could exhibit it anywhere. Nevertheless, this does not indicate that women did not grapple with acceptance in those spheres. Another crucial facet of women's existences was the fabrication of fabric. The textile had turned into a significant part of Indian exports, and every woman in a fortress was capable of twirling yarn. Weaving had become a household enterprise, and many of them took up residence near urban centers where silk, cotton, and wool were in high demand.
For imperial women of Mughal, a significant duty was to guarantee the well-being and triumph of younger generations who were to ascend to authority. They instructed and counseled princes in their maturation and conflicts for the throne and consequently influenced politics. Empress Nur Jahan could surpass the authority restraints imposed on women at that time by directing streams of authority towards herself. She relished exhibiting her supremacy, yet she could remain in the shadows and manipulate others.
Chapter 4. Europe. Witches, Laborers, and Queens
Religious upheavals have tinted women's existences in Europe in the 16th and 18th centuries. On one side, due to Protestant notions of an individual approach to redemption, women were able to access schooling. Conversely, convictions that women were associated with the devil have tormented the minds of rulers. Witch hunts have been triggered by patriarchy and misogyny, and their consequences undermined females' faith and assurance for eras to follow. Public executions for sorcery were methods for men to subjugate women through agony, degradation, and dread.
A substantial transformation occurred in the realm of female labor and empowerment; when formerly women could perform specialized tasks and play a significant part in politics, in the 17th century men have diverted them from that trajectory. For women, domestic chores, childbearing, and nurturing were the topmost priorities. Urban crafts that women engaged in mainly consisted of ale-brewing and supplying. However, by the conclusion of the 17th century, ale-brewing privileges were revoked for women.
While male monarchs and philosophers contended that women were too sentimental to excel in governing, numerous queens ascended to power in the 16th century. For many of them, authority was inherited, and some of them governed as regents for male successors. In contrast to men's beliefs, those women were as proficient in managing realms as men could be. An outstanding illustration of this is Maria Theresa of Austria. She emanated bravery, ambition, and sound judgment when ruling. Furthermore, she esteemed education for herself and the authorities. Her life narrative and deeds function as a refutation of misogynistic notions within governing structures.
