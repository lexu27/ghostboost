Sula is a tale by Nobel Prize-winning writer Toni Morrison, penned in 1973. It is an African American literary work that unveils profound ideas of affection, ethics, and ethical principles. The tale encompasses some emblematic features whereby the writer discloses an individual’s perspective on life. A notable trait of the tale is duality in certain aspects; for instance, some pass away from drowning and some from a blaze. Through such methods, Toni Morrison was able to achieve the tale’s aim of communicating the duality of the world. The dual arrangement of the tale, alongside its finale, signifies the positive facet owing to the depiction of honesty, crucial principles of life, and the profound significance of the “circles of sorrow”.
One might observe the representation of the duality of the world, specifically good and evil, and at the conclusion of the tale, notwithstanding all the prior incidents, the genuine instinct of Sula’s companion shapes a climax. Hence, one might discern a potent Nel’s response: “It was a fine cry—loud and long—but it had no bottom, and it had no top, just circles and circles of sorrow” (Morrison, 79). Specifically, this occurrence implies Nel’s duality of sentiments, as all along, the protagonist appeared to yearn for Jude, Nel’s spouse. Nonetheless, in a burst of honest sorrow at the finale of the tale, Nel realizes that the sorrow stems from the period spent without Sula. Just as all the townsfolk, who appear to despise Sula. However, no one recognized that the heroine was the cause for their unity.
Duality is also depicted in the tale’s symbol, particularly the blemish above Sula’s eye. The alteration in the blemish’s look symbolizes the protagonist’s maturation and the gradual renunciation of societal conventions. In turn, it is also the antithetical characteristic of Nel’s persona, which embraces all the standards. Additionally, there was an uncertain perception of the blemish by various characters: Nel deemed it a rose, epitomizing love, feminine beauty, and companionship. Jude viewed it as dishonesty and seduction, that is, dual and contrary to Nel. Consequently, the writer was able to articulate the ambiguity of the world and tangible and intangible entities. Besides, Toni Morison was able to involve the reader in the notion that the perception of entities heavily relies on how one observes them.
The duality of the tale also typifies the finale of the book, which initially appears tragic. The protagonist’s demise, sorrow, tears, and despondent impulse do not appear to belong to an upbeat viewpoint. Nevertheless, the writer’s primary motive was to exhibit a glimmer of hope in the guise of a heartfelt outburst of affection and companionship through Nel’s sorrow. This shapes the circles of sorrow: the initial, implicit, exhibited throughout the whole plot. Namely, all the adverse incidents and the environment of the protagonists: association with spouses, challenging living conditions, and the slaying of offspring by the mother. Lastly, the second explicit circle of sorrow symbolizes the principal facets of human life, namely sincerity, selflessness, love, and companionship. All this was conveyed in a minor yet pivotal segment of the tale, particularly in the ultimate impulse of Nel.
The ambiguity and profundity of the essence of Toni Morrison’s tale can also be discerned by assessing the criticism of the book. Thus, at first glance, it appears that the narrative delineates the repercussions of treachery on the friendship of two African American women, yet the writer does not halt there (Nittle, 56). The tale provokes contemplation about what defines a person as virtuous or immoral and where the demarcation between these notions lies (Nittle, 56). It articulates the haziness of the boundaries between the fundamental concepts of ethics and life, bestowing the reader with supplementary room for scrutiny. Furthermore, it also symbolizes the ambiguity of the interpretation of the finale of the tale. As previously indicated, one might perceive the finale as nothing other than pessimistic. Nevertheless, considering the deeper dimension of the concepts of good and bad, joy and sorrow, one might discern an optimistic element manifested in genuine outbursts.
Various viewpoints of the comprehension of the tale are also noted in the context of portraying diverse ruthless scenes, for instance, the killing of a child by a mother. The polyphonic nature of Morrison’s narration should be evaluated through various standpoints, both in Sula and Beloved novels (Palladino, 26). This technique serves as a dual component, expressing brutality on one hand and, on the other hand, serving as a potent narrative component. The purpose of this primarily is to heighten the impact on the reader, as well as to prompt one to acknowledge the stark contrast of the plot components.
To conclude, one learned that due to the dual arrangement, the finale of the tale articulates an optimistic facet to a greater extent. The uncertain interpretation of symbols, such as Sula’s birthmark, as well as the perception of the heroine by the denizens of the town and other characters, epitomizes a multi-level structure of life. Additionally, Nel’s “circles of sorrow” symbolize two factors, concealed, adverse, and explicit, formulating sincerity and crucial moral and life values.
