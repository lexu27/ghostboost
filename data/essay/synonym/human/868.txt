A wheel can be defined as a basic wheel mechanism typically affixed to the underside of a specific object to facilitate its motion and lessen the force required to alter its placement. Such specifics can be utilized in shopping trolleys, work seats, beds, or furnishings. The given wheel comprises of six components necessary to ensure its steady operation, attachment to the needed object, and rolling. These specifics are the metal foundation, two upright supports, four bolts, bushing, axle, and a wheel. Once put together, they ensure the correct functioning of the detail and its connection.
The foundation is crafted from ductile cast iron and weighs 1083.5 grams. It serves as the base to secure all other objects and assemble the wheel mechanism. It also needs to be fixed to a specific surface to allow it to be mobile. The upright supports are positioned on the base by utilizing accessible SHCS bolts. The decision to use steel as the material is justified by the substantial pressure exerted by objects on the foundation.
The wheel mechanism also features two upright supports made of ductile cast iron. Their primary purpose is to support the wheel and ensure its rotation without friction on the foundation. The weight of each upright support is 437.6 grams. They are situated on two ends of the foundation using SHCS fasteners and must also withstand a considerable load, which clarifies the material choice for their production.
The mechanism includes four socket head cap fasteners (SCHS) necessary to secure upright supports and maintain their stable position on the foundation. Each SCHS weighs 20.3 grams, and the fasteners are composed of simple carbon steel, ensuring their dependability and durability.
There are also two bushings required for the reliable operation of the wheel mechanism. They are made of tin bearing bronze and weigh 58.9 grams each. They are affixed to the upright supports to support the axle and decrease the friction between two surfaces, as well as resist wear.
The mechanism contains the axle essential to ensure that the wheel will rotate and facilitate the object's motion. It is crafted from AISI 1020 carbon steel and weighs 182.2 grams. The selection of this material guarantees that the axle will endure the pressure from the wheel and the weight of an object that needs to be moved.
Lastly, the wheel is the final element of the wheel mechanism. It is made of ductile cast iron and is situated between two upright supports by using an axle and two bushings. Its weight is 872.5 grams, making it the second heaviest element among the others. The size of the aperture in the center of the wheel must match the dimension of the axle to ensure the possibility of assembling the mechanism and achieving its stable operation.
Overall, once assembled, all elements allow the item or object to be relocated. Positioned at a fixed fork created by two upright supports, the wheel reduces the force required to alter the position of an object. The alignment of the two upright supports is determined when a wheel is affixed to the required surface. The axle with two bushings on either side enables the wheel to rotate smoothly and guarantees the stable operation of the mechanism. The utilization of metal and carbon steel ensures the necessary sturdiness and the capacity to withstand pressure during use.
