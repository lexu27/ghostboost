Preamble
Several psychological theories endeavor to formalize and structure the intricate components of interpersonal communication. One of the primary features of interpersonal relationships is that they develop gradually through a sequence of stages. The Six-Stage Model of Relationships comprises contact, engagement, closeness, deterioration, restoration, and disintegration (DeVito, 2016). The movie He’s Just Not That Into You (2009), helmed by Ken Kwapis, is an American ensemble comedy that tracks the complex interpersonal mechanisms of six romantic relationships. Each pair progresses through different phases of the Six-Stage Model and embodies a distinct relationship theory.
Relationship Assessment
Alex and Gigi: Relationship Principles Theory
The relationship between Alex and Gigi commences with interactive contact at a bar. The initial phase of the contact stage involves creating a mental and physical image of the other person and exchanging fundamental details (DeVito, 2016). Gigi visits a bar and initiates a conversation with the manager, Alex, confessing that she arrived to orchestrate a chance encounter with a man who never phoned after a date (Kwapis, 2009). In response, Alex purchases her a beverage and provides her with candid romantic guidance. Alex and Gigi’s point of contact transpires at the bar, and he conveys the impression of a dating expert with valuable knowledge.
This initial impression leads to engagement, the subsequent stage of their relationship. Gigi contacts Alex multiple times when considering other dating options to seek further advice. This progression exemplifies the relationship principles theory, which asserts that interpersonal relationships are sustained by adherence to specific principles and deteriorate if these principles are breached (DeVito, 2016). Gigi endeavors to understand the dating principles from Alex to comprehend why she has faced setbacks in relationships previously. Subsequently, Alex proposes introducing Gigi to his unmarried acquaintances and invites her to a gathering at his residence. Nevertheless, Gigi misinterprets this gesture as a sign of romantic interest and endeavors to kiss him (Kwapis, 2009). They engage in an interpersonal dispute due to intimacy concerns as Gigi assumes that their engagement is progressing towards a serious relationship. However, Alex's rejection and their ensuing argument lead to the temporary dissolution of the relationship.
The dissolution prompts Alex to realize that he is prepared to pursue closeness with Gigi. Upon being ignored via voicemail, he shows up at her residence and acknowledges that he has developed feelings for her (Kwapis, 2009). Unintentionally, he had satisfied the principles of romantic relationships with Gigi by being authentic, spending considerable time together, boosting her self-esteem, and experiencing an inexplicable connection when together (DeVito, 2016). The concluding scene depicts them in a committed relationship with a mutual social circle, indicating their formal entry into the closeness stage.
Ben and Janine: Relationship Dialectics Theory
Ben and Janine are a wedded pair, and the narrative begins with their relationship in the deterioration stage. This phase is characterized by diminishing bonds between partners due to personal discontent and emotional detachment (DeVito, 2016). Janine is exasperated with Ben because he is hesitant to have a child and suspects him of smoking despite knowing that her father succumbed to lung cancer. She occupies herself with home improvements and withdraws from the relationship. Additionally, Ben is dissatisfied because he is not prepared for matrimony and still feels enticed by other women. He acknowledges that he proposed to Janine solely because of their prolonged companionship and her ultimatum: either wed or part ways (Kwapis, 2009). Once Janine discovers an ashtray in the backyard, he attributes it to the construction workers, but she remains unconvinced. The relationship between Ben and Janine is deteriorating due to their conflicting beliefs about their lifestyle and distrust issues.
The mistrust issues escalate due to Ben's extramarital affair, which eventually culminates in the dissolution of their relationship. Ben's choice to initiate an affair instead of divorcing Janine is elucidated by the Relationship Dialectics Theory. This theory asserts that individuals in relationships encounter internal tension due to conflicting motives and desires (DeVito, 2016). Ben experiences tension between novelty and predictability, craving intimate encounters with other women while simultaneously being unwilling to forsake the stability of his secure marriage with Janine. There are three primary methods to resolve this tension: accepting them, exiting the relationship, or rebalancing through negotiation (DeVito, 2016). When Ben confesses his affair to Janine, she initially pardons him and briefly attempts to rekindle their intimacy and physical relationship to salvage the relationship. She believes that Ben's actions are reasonable since their physical connection has been lacking for a while. However, once Janine discovers a pack of cigarettes in his trousers, she vacates the residence and demands a divorce. Interpersonal discord due to intimacy concerns, distrust, and personal imperfections result in the dissolution of Ben and Janine's matrimony.
Ben and Anna: Attraction Theory
The movie also portrays Ben's extramarital involvement with Anna, the point of contact of which occurs at a grocery store and rapidly progresses to intimacy. Ben allows Anna to skip ahead of him in line, and she wins a reward as the thousandth customer (Kwapis, 2009). They engage in conversation and flirtation in the parking lot; Ben acknowledges his marital status but furnishes Anna with his business card under the pretense of aiding her in her music career. Although they feign pursuing a friendship, they contrive ways to meet covertly, such as at Ben's workplace and Anna's yoga session. Ultimately, Ben reveals that his marriage is unsatisfactory, and they embark on a physical relationship.
Their chemistry and inability to resist each other exemplify the Attraction Theory. This theory posits that individuals establish relationships based on five principles of attraction: likeness, closeness, reinforcement, physical appeal and character, socioeconomic and educational standing, and mutual liking (DeVito, 2016). Both characters express their physical attraction to each other on multiple occasions. Anna asserts that she cannot stop contemplating him and praises his physique. Though Ben initially endeavors to delineate boundaries, he concedes that he finds Anna "truly attractive" (Kwapis, 2009, 00:41:18). Their progression into the intimacy stage is ultimately facilitated by Ben's admiration of Anna's physique as she plunges into a pool unclothed.
Ben and Anna's relationship is eventually besieged by distrust issues. Initially, Anna believed that she and Ben were destined to be together and that he would abandon his wife for her. However, Ben compels her to conceal herself in a closet when Janine unexpectedly appears at his workplace. Anna overhears their intimate encounter, and Ben acknowledges his desire to mend his marriage with Janine. Anna comprehends that she is merely a paramour to Ben, and she storms out, declaring that he "will never touch [her] again" (Kwapis, 2009, 01:38:30). Ben and Anna's relationship officially disintegrates at that juncture, and they cease all communication.
Anna and Conor: Social Exchange Theory
The majority of Anna and Conor's relationship in the film is depicted in
