Various societies may suggest specific approaches towards medical arrangements. Some of them may lack trust in contemporary medicine practices and prefer native methods that have been utilized for generations. In Ghana, contemporary medicine is viewed as a costly substitute for traditional healing techniques. Because of skepticism about its efficacy and limited health literacy, individuals are reluctant to view it as an option (Gyasi et al., 2016). This highlights the adverse influence of health convictions in the area. However, health-related beliefs and actions of distinct ethnic communities can lead to favorable health outcomes, significant and hazardous health repercussions, or no harmful health effects and hence are innocuous.

Regarding the medical management, it is feasible to identify several ramifications of health convictions. One of such ramifications is the restriction of drug administration to physicians or healers in western areas and only when a patient displays specific indications. In community medicine, the prescription should be carried out by experts with contemporary knowledge, insight, and ethical responsibilities in the form of Hippocrates’s pledge. Conversely, some communities may solely depend on cultural practices of drug administration. Therapeutic approaches may be applied based on bodily elements such as humoral imbalances exhibited as excessive “hot” or “cold” (Taek et al., 2019). Consequently, “Cold” conditions are addressed with “hot” medications, while “hot” ailments are managed with “cold” drugs, reinstating equilibrium to the individual (Taek et al., 2019). This illustrates how such cultural aspects as health convictions can lead to a substantial disparity in medical management.

Two potential unfavorable reactions from health convictions could be viewed as an overdose and an underdose. The first pertains to the inadequate intake of medications purely based on prior experience that lacks sound medical understanding. Following the introduction of the COVID-19 vaccine, numerous media influencers, without prior consultation with medical experts, were misusing the vaccine injection by administering multiple injections at unapproved intervals. This conduct is perilous as it may induce unverified complications within the body. Conversely, underdose is also plausible as individuals perceive western medicine as deeply flawed and unsafe for consumption. They may opt to reduce recommended dosages that undermine the drugs' efficacy and have minimal impact on relieving the symptoms, resulting in prolonged illness.

One potential problem is adherence to medication regimens could be subjective attitudes regarding chronic ailments. They consistently and negatively affect patients’ adherence to treatment schedules (Shahin et al., 2019). Considering patients’ understanding while offering health advice and/or delivering medical care is one of the dilemmas for health practitioners in enhancing adherence (Shahin et al., 2019). Patient-based factors influencing adherence could be cognitive limitations and physical impairments, low self-confidence, substance misuse, lack of information, and motivation. These aspects may shape patients’ belief in the effectiveness of medication and foster a subjective interpretation of adherence that frequently escalates non-adherence risks among older individuals.

Several intervention strategies can be formulated to enhance adherence. These strategies encompass patient education, which can be defined by telephone counseling sessions with professionals that would be recurring and individualized (Kini & Ho, 2018). Another approach is medication regimen supervision that could be employed with patients who are hesitant to ingest drugs due to the fear of adverse effects. It involves utilizing combination pills so that patients will consume fewer pills daily (Kini & Ho, 2018). Nevertheless, it is crucial to acknowledge that adherence will be influenced by the feasibility and accessibility of the practice or health system.
