Introduction
The provision of top-notch healthcare services during the pandemic is a crucial endeavor for ensuring the welfare of citizens while the requirements of hospital staff are often overlooked. The occurrences of this kind are notably observed in the domain of mental health issues which are common for personnel due to heightened stress levels (Chirico et al., 2021). Hence, it is vital to explore the methods to avert unfavorable outcomes among them while securing the continuity of care for critical patients.
Background
The selection of the subject, mental health of healthcare providers working with critical patients, is conditional on its relevance to the needs of both patients and medical experts. Therefore, it was articulated as a challenge of a multi-faceted nature that should be a priority of corresponding organizations. For the exploration of the specified issue, the appropriate setting is one of the local hospitals willing to engage in the project, and the contact there will be an administrator with access to the essential information. The perceived need for this initiative is the significance of establishing new guidelines for healthcare professionals to avoid burnout or post-traumatic stress disorders, which are highlighted as the main issues stemming from workplace conditions (Chirico et al., 2021). This necessity is corroborated by the prior research, according to which depression, anxiety, and insomnia, alongside the issues mentioned above, pose a specific threat to female nurses (Soylu et al., 2021). Hence, it is crucial to evaluate this category of workers in the first instance and formulate preventive measures applicable to them as well as other healthcare providers in the future.
Background of the Project
The project’s topic was chosen due to escalating concerns related to healthcare providers’ mental health, particularly during the pandemic. Although new potential infections should be appropriately addressed with clinicians focusing on patients’ physical well-being, the emotional well-being of nurses is exceedingly important for delivering quality healthcare (Stuijfzand et al., 2020; Soylu et al., 2021). Therefore, the project aims to assess the provision of mental health services for healthcare providers of critical patients in a primary care facility as its setting (facility) and with Jewell Snider as the mentor.
SMART Goals
In order to tackle the challenge identified in the preceding section, it is essential to set a specific goal. In this case, it will be formulated concerning the evidence indicating that some categories of workers are more prone to issues in this area, and stress levels are linked to a variety of circumstances (Chirico et al., 2021; Soylu et al., 2021). Consequently, I will utilize the data obtained from the hospital to determine the most vulnerable groups of employees in terms of mental health to develop precise recommendations for preventing adverse outcomes within one week. I will establish a framework applicable to the selected setting with regard to differences in specialists’ conditions within the subsequent week. As a result, I will dedicate two days discussing the findings with the administrator and decide on practical measures to be implemented within a month.
Initial Project Design
Figure 1. Flow chart illustrating the initial project design.
The initial project design comprises the smart goals in the predetermined order as per the hospital’s needs. The steps encompass examining the available data (sick leaves, reported problems), integrating the findings into a comprehensive plan, and coordinating actions with the facility’s representative with the subsequent implementation of the elaborated framework (see Figure 1). In this scenario, responsibility will be divided between the researcher and the administrator since the former is responsible for the accuracy of conclusions, while the latter is engaged in the process of conveying information. The materials for the designed project encompass solely the records of employees’ mental health issues and their type. Taking into account the stages designated for its implementation, it will take about two months.
Goals
Primarily, the project aims to investigate healthcare employees’ exhaustion, stress, burnout, compassion fatigue, and other mental health disorders that arise in the workplace. Additionally, it will cover the extent of the provision of mental health aid for them by the hospital’s services (Søvold, 2021; Cai et al., 2020). Lastly, the project will evaluate mental healthcare amenities provided for critical patients by healthcare specialists during the pandemic.
Need Assessment
The project’s perceived needs encompass financial, stakeholder, patient, spiritual, facility, and funding needs. In general, the objective of the project is the evaluation of the effectiveness and accessibility of mental health aid provided for healthcare professionals and critical patients for its subsequent enhancement (Chirico et al., 2021; Serrano-Ripoll et al., 2020; Greenberg et al., 2020). Thus, the improved mental health of these categories will lessen the burden and costs on the health care system, positively impact patient outcomes and interaction among the facility’s members, and contribute to individuals’ emotional, spiritual, and even physical health. In order to make decisions, allocate resources, and achieve programmatic objectives, needs will be assessed through direct observations and literature review.
Stakeholders
The project’s primary stakeholders are psychologists, social workers, and nurses. Therefore, psychologists aim to support the project, social workers are indifferent but need to be informed, and nurses may resist due to the belief that the project may negatively affect what they do. To address all of them, the researcher should provide accurate information concerning the research by writing a letter to all stakeholders and explaining that their personal information and results will be safeguarded. In this case, trust between stakeholders and the researcher will be established.
Project Requirements and Tools
In general, the project necessitates time, financial, and material resources, including tools and equipment, to achieve its goals. Firstly, the emotional well-being of the involved stakeholders will be assessed by scholars before the project as a baseline to compare the project’s findings with the results. If the project’s requirements are met, PERT and WBS techniques will be crucial for measurements (Suryono & Hasbullah, 2020). Simultaneously, a Christian servant-leadership approach may be utilized to guide the researcher to design and implement interventions developing and optimizing performance. Leaders concentrate on day-to-day education, performance preparation, and the promotion of stakeholders’ personal achievements.
Literature Review
Available secondary data focuses on the mental health of healthcare practitioners who care for critical patients during the pandemic. Literature search strategies that include the use of keywords, phrases, and key terms will be applied. The central database for the researcher will be the online school library. The CRAAP test will be utilized to assess the reliability of resources (Esparrago-Kalidas, 2021). The inclusion criteria will be workers’ mental health – thus, articles that address it will be included, while articles with a lack of identified information will be excluded, respectively.
AlAteeq et al. (2020) address the mental health of Saudi Arabian healthcare providers during the pandemic. Using questionnaires for a cross-sectional study, authors aim to assess the levels of anxiety and depression among healthcare specialists in medical facilities. According to the results, more than half of the participants experience both anxiety and depressive disorder (AlAteeq et al., 2020). This study demonstrates the necessity of addressing healthcare specialists’ individual issues along with the promotion of altruism, solidarity, and social inclusion.
