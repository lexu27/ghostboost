The COVID-19 outbreak, which emerged globally for nearly three years, completely altered the lifestyle of the contemporary world. Numerous scholars, reporters, and authors address this subject and discuss various scenarios that can at times result in astonishment. Oâ€™Connor Meg detailed one of these incidents in the piece "Maricopa county moved homeless individuals to Sweltering parking lots in reaction to COVID-19". This examination seeks to explore this content to pinpoint which actions were executed inaccurately and what outcomes ensued. 

Individuals lacking stable housing have emerged as a specific peril to the transmission of the pandemic. This is because this demographic lacks a fixed abode, frequently interacts closely with one another, neglects hygiene protocols, and has limited access to medical services. One viewpoint suggests that it is crucial to mitigate the root causes of this issue. In essence, it is vital to enhance the level of social aid for the homeless by expanding housing availability and social privileges. Conversely, it is argued that homelessness and unemployment are psychological phenomena, and external factors cannot substantially aid in their eradication. Consequently, the COVID-19 epidemic and the circumstances of the homeless have become notably severe in the United States of America. 

The occurrence depicted in the scrutinized article unfolded in Maricopa County. Adjacent to Arizona's largest homeless refuge, Central Arizona Shelter Services (CASS) had long accommodated tents with homeless individuals (O'Conner para. 1). As a measure to combat COVID-19, the authorities opted to relocate and establish the encampment near the existing one in Maricopa County, now situated outdoors. Consequently, hundreds of individuals were compelled to alter their habitat to an enclosed asphalt locale devoid of shade in the scorching summer temperatures. 

As an instance of a sufferer of homeless displacement, there existed the circumstance of Elisha McKinley. Despite the woman nearly securing a dwelling, she was transferred to the encampment a few months back. Additionally, McKinley encountered misconduct from law enforcement, who discarded a cart containing her birth certificate, identification documents, and housewarming presents from her daughter (O'Conner para. 5). Furthermore, although the government initially characterized these actions as temporary, permanent fixtures were erected, resulting in the expulsion of individuals, hindering many from returning to their prior location. 

All these steps were implemented to curb the outbreak within the homeless segment of the populace, yet the authorities succeeded in maintaining control of the situation. Besides the irrationality of exposing people outdoors under the blazing sun, this resolution was met with significant skepticism from both the community and governmental bodies. This skepticism intensified after news surfaced regarding the demise of three individuals in the cordoned parking lot. 

Moreover, despite the opposition towards relocating homeless citizens to the parking lot, social welfare agencies advocate for altering the land-use permit, i.e., expanding it. This decision aims to attract a larger number of homeless individuals. Nevertheless, akin to the initial action of relocating the encampment, this proposal encountered resistance. In this instance, businesses and residents in the vicinity expressed discontent. Such an outlook could notably impede the expansion process, as providers will need to await the city council's authorization. Drawing from the unfavorable experience of executing the initiative concerning homeless encampments, the Phoenix government is instituting fresh measures. Consequently, Phoenix procured funds to lease one hundred and fifty hotel rooms for homeless residents, albeit this represents only a small fraction of the entire infected homeless populace. 

Therefore, this assessment examined the article detailing the somewhat factual actions in Phoenix. The authorities, in the battle against the new coronavirus outbreak, relocated homeless individuals to a confined parking area amid high temperatures. This move resulted in the fatalities of several persons, triggering a wave of public discontent. Since the pandemic remains unconquered, numerous individuals are losing their employment and seeking jobless benefits. Hence, service providers and the state administration must devise strategies to address the looming issue. An encouraging trend has been the distribution of housing rental aid.
