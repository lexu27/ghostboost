Blockchain can be characterized as an evolving technology that is increasingly utilized in various domains of human activity. The study by Grech and Camilleri (2017) offers insight into applications of blockchain in education, which are "still in their early stages" (p. 8). The authors highlight the numerous advantages and societal benefits that this concept can introduce into the academic environment. Grech and Camilleri (2017) assert that "within education, activities likely to be impacted by blockchain technology include the bestowal of qualifications, licensing and accreditation, administration of student records, intellectual property management, and payments" (p. 8). Despite the nascent stage of blockchain implementation in the educational sector, this technology has the potential to revolutionize the student information systems market and provide numerous advantages for society.
The public adoption of blockchain technology can facilitate the automation of processes such as accomplishment record verification, diploma authentication, and permit issuance. In general, Grech and Camilleri (2017) propose "eight scenarios for the utilization of the Blockchain in an education context, based on the present state of technology development and deployment" (p. 95). Specifically, it can be utilized to safeguard certificates, authenticate accreditation, automatically recognize and transfer credits, and retain lifelong learning passports. Moreover, this technology can aid in monitoring intellectual property, receive student payments, offer financial support to students, and improve student verification procedures.
In essence, the report examines the fundamental principles of blockchain utilization in education. The authors conclude that this technology fosters values such as confidence, cooperation, openness, self-governance, and disintermediation. Additionally, Grech and Camilleri (2017) "propose that further advancement of the technology in the educational sector should be viewed as a collective responsibility of the market and of public authorities" (p. 9). Blockchain can enable students and revolutionize the market through its innovative approaches to education.
