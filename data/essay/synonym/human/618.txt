The tome, “Coaching habit: Say less, ask more & change the way you lead forever”, is by Stanier M. Bungay. The issuance was unveiled in 2016 through Box of Crayons Press. The writer and publishers assert that they provide “managers practical tools so they can coach in ten minutes or less” (Bungay, 2016, p. 1). One significant contention that arises is that quietness does not signify lack of knowledge or disrespect. This aspect has been emphasized in some sections of the tome because a considerable majority of managers frequently link silence to some degree of disrespect. As per the academic, on many occasions, silence might also imply a crucial and astute thought process. Particularly, the academic elucidates that appropriate coaching would facilitate managers and leaders to recognize such situations and aid in the development of both the junior staff and his or her supervisor.
It can be contended that the author upholds a general presumption that coaching solely encompasses the manager. This is because a significant portion of counsel provided is targeted at the supervisors. The role of the junior staff should also have been examined due to the essence of coaching. He details that several aspects, labeled as question masterclasses are pivotal for good coaching. The initial question, also known as the kick start question is crucial. The writer expounds that it is a question “in which you unearth the power of an opening question that gets the conversation happening fast and deep” (Bungay, 2016, p. 36). It can be debated that listening is a fundamental aspect of any form of coaching. This can be associated with various investigations that have been conducted on the same subject. Bungay (2016) employs this as his final thought and it can be argued that it encapsulates the topic effectively.
