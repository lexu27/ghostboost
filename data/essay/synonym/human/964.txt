Synopsis
Because of many socio-cultural and scientific upheavals that occurred over the 20th century, the stance toward various social groups was reconsidered by the collective majority. During the course of social revolution, the scientific community introduced the term "marginalized" groups to depict individuals who do not conform to the standard notion of the normalized American. These individuals lack the social advantages that are assumed to be inherent to regular citizens. The underprivileged as a group can involve diverse social groups that are categorized based on different attributes, such as ethnicity, sex, sexual preference, or impairment. The common and unifying principle for these groups is their association with the surrounding society, where they are devoid of the fundamental conditions that are viewed as essential for a comfortable survival. This is because of their opposition to the mainstream of American society, resulting in disadvantaged groups being in the position of a minority, oppressed by the systemic reality of the collective majority. By examining two distinct social groups that match this characteristic, it becomes feasible not only to track the history of alterations in the political and cultural landscape but also to critically grasp it.
LGBTQ+ Rights: a Chronicle
The battle for homosexuals and transgender individuals for the entitlement to express themselves has been lengthy enough and can officially trace back to the establishment of the Human Rights Society, one of the oldest human rights organizations in America. This society was the first to openly endorse individuals with non-normative sexual orientations, and their publication Friendship and Freedom was the initial release for homosexuals. Because of prolonged legislative pressure, this society was soon dissolved, but its emergence marked the commencement of the legal history of gay activism. This historical illustration appears indicative in revealing the pressure of the prevailing social forces over the groups marginalized by it. Subsequently, the fight against homosexuals was at the official level after the conclusion of the post-war restoration (Portmann, 2018). At that time, numerous individuals were terminated from their positions in government or military service. This was executed because homosexuality was classified as a mental ailment that disrupts the stable operation of the psyche.
LGBTQ+ Battle for Rights Now
More recently, in America, LGBT + activism continues to yield results, striving to counteract the attitude of the social majority toward their representatives. The empowerment of the transgender community merits special mention here since, presently, the normative restrictions excluding transgender individuals from various social activities are truly nullified. Restroom visits corresponding to gender identity have become a distinct matter here, as the ruling of the Obama administration was overturned by the subsequent President, Donald Trump. For four years, a male student suffering from gender dysphoria Gavin Grimm contested in court for the privilege to use the women's restroom and succeeded in the case in 2020 (Meyer & Keenan, 2017). This example is illustrative in demonstrating how the concept of gender identity surpasses the limits imposed by normative representations of sex. This year, President Biden permitted transgender military members to enlist in the army, affirming that every qualified American can serve a country.
Indigenous American Populations: a Survey
Indigenous American populations underwent an inconceivable number of acts of subjugation and brutality throughout the 19th century and beyond. Historically, following President Jackson's proclamation, the compulsory relocation of tens of thousands of Native Americans led to a staggering number of fatalities. Genocide or ethnic cleansing resulted in the slaughter of over 50 million native people in America over the span of a century (Hackel, 2017). To date, Native Americans remain a socially vulnerable segment of the American populace, as a complete reparation of the harm inflicted on these people still seems unattainable.
Rights of Indigenous Populations Today
The primary issue that Native Americans confront in contemporary society is their fundamentally distorted and prejudiced cultural perception. Native Americans in modern society are exoticized, deemed different, and thus, they detach themselves from the mainstream of American society. Disseminating cultural awareness that would dismantle stereotypes could be the solution to this misunderstanding. Only through educating others, who typically willingly reject new knowledge in favor of a stereotype, will it be possible to eliminate prejudice against the indigenous population of America. The Native American Rights Foundation is an exemplary instance of a Native American rights group that conserves not only their culture but also their tribal natural resources.
Male Dominance and Homophobia
The notion of patriarchy implies that within the structure of social order, it is men who dictate the organization and arrangement of society. In it, males hold the utmost authority and social privileges, occupying a dominant stance over the rest of society. Through this concept, it appears feasible to analyze the phenomenon of rejection of homosexuals and transgender individuals in American society. Same-sex relationships seem unacceptable in such a society, which could also be labeled heteropatriarchal in feminist theory. In such a system of social-hierarchical interactions, only a normative cisgender man can hold an authoritative position. Consequently, homophobia can be and frequently is one of the adverse manifestations of patriarchal ideology.
Social Stratification and Native People in the US
The concept of social stratification in sociology is a term akin to the idea of the arrangement, organization, and categorization of elements and groups. Stratification entails a segmentation of society into social tiers determined by specific features and criteria. When discussing the history of the indigenous peoples on the land of the United States, it should be noted that from the outset of their interaction with the colonialists, they were socially marginalized and pushed to the lower rungs of the new social hierarchy. At present, their position also deviates from the norm – according to the stratification system, they occupy the bottom tier of the social pyramid in numerous aspects, such as income or occupational categories.
Self-identification and LGBTQ+
It would be intriguing to examine the struggle of the LGBTQ + community for equality from the perspective of the concept of self-identity. This theoretical concept of understanding an individual is encompassed in the ongoing process of self-reflection on the subject of their character. An individual is continually conscious of who they are in the process of evolving into someone. The fluidity of gender inherent in transsexual culture acquires a distinctive interpretation through the theory of self-identity, as it represents a phase in the journey of recognizing oneself and one's own development. Hence, supporting these social groups is crucial since, otherwise, they are marginalized, posing a risk of losing social identification or encountering discrimination.
Functionalism and Native People
Through the theory of functionalism, particularly developed by the renowned sociologist Emile Durkheim, one should cautiously analyze the current condition of the indigenous peoples of America. Functionalism endeavors to perceive society as something striving for unity rather than being in a state of conflict. The conflicts between societies arose due to the absence of common objectives and the aspiration to possess a singular image of the future. The conduct of the colonizers was influenced by two attitudes unveiled by Durkheim – selfishness and belief in ethical values. Dominance over the indigenous population is attributed to the longing for enrichment and missionary conviction in the validity of their own value system. In contemporary reality, indigenous peoples find themselves on the fringes of society precisely due to the extensive trauma inflicted by English-speaking society. It can be asserted that the indigenous population constitutes a distinct society aiming to safeguard the remaining facets of their culture.
