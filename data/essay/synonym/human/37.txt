Amazon has expanded to become one of the most significant corporations in the US. Millions of individuals depend on the highly effective deliveries and economical prices. Additionally, the corporation has evolved into one of the largest employers, as numerous Amazon fulfillment centers are spread throughout the country. Given such magnitude, a wide array of challenges inevitably emerge. Lately, the numerous grievances regarding the manner Amazon treats its workers have succeeded in capturing public attention. Therefore, a dedicated analysis is required to comprehend the type of working conditions and environment the IT behemoth offers.
Key Issues: Job Discontentment and High Turnover Rates
Ensuring $15 per hour might serve as a pleasant incentive for individuals in disadvantaged neighborhoods, but only in the short term. Encouraging individuals to perform better by gradually boosting their wages would not only be more attractive and psychologically comforting but also highly advantageous in the long run. Task allocations and employee drive interact through the level of labor market competition â€“ that is, the opportunity to transition to another company (Bar-Isaac & Levy, 2022). As a result, Amazon should contemplate implementing a more conventional approach to inspiring employees, which will aid in decreasing current turnover rates.
Cause: Ineffective Motivation Strategies
E-commerce is no longer as profitable as it was a decade ago. It has become the primary method people engage in shopping, particularly amidst the Covid-19 pandemic. Consequently, numerous new firms have seized the chance and succeeded in expanding their market shares. Hence, Amazon is committed to significantly reducing expenses through various methods, including erecting its fulfillment centers in neighborhoods that have not fully rebounded from recent economic downturns. According to Kinicki (2020), turnover is one of the key outcomes that should be factored in when tailoring the array of inputs. Currently, the corporation's turnover rate remains exceedingly high.
Preferred Solution: Employing More Conventional Motivation Frameworks
The focus on intimidation, the discouragement of teamwork, and many other of Amazon's existing policies significantly weaken employee motivation and the corporation's public perception. The envisioned potential solution strategy involves implementing structured salary increases, improving bonus systems, and altering the way employees are supervised. These measures will assist the IT behemoth in motivating employees in a significantly more optimistic and respectful manner.
