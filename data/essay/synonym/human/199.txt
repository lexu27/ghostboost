The distinction among a physician approaching a patient compared to nursing practice on the same subject can be a compelling subject due to the highlighted characteristics that are underscored when aligned. Thus, medical practice utilizing oneâ€™s physiological condition while nursing also integrating psychological reactions is a efficient approach in delineating the contrast between the two clearly while working based on PICOT. The aspects to be covered are the variance in the research methodology. Given that medical practice is more impartial because it depends on specific results and evidence, the research is quantitative. Conversely, the PICOT query encompassed in the nursing practice suggests mixed research that takes into account both viewpoints and information.
Subject presents the contrast between nursing and medical practice regarding the method of diagnosis. The critical element that is being raised is the PICOT regarding laboratory findings versus evaluation based on symptoms. The study can emphasize the results in terms of the precision of the discoveries while concentrating on the comparison between the two ideas. The feature that demonstrates its significance is the general similarity between the two frameworks that may yield comparable results depending on how the study will be carried out and its discoveries.
The potential study focusing on the nursing practice of averting specific injuries and offering more patient-centered and individualized care can underscore the significance of decision-making in the sector. Decision-making is a crucial concept in the nursing care domain (Nibbelink & Brewer, 2018). Thus, a PICOT query on the subject of delivering specialized care in terms of preventing falls versus exclusively addressing them can be an efficient means of deliberating nursing from an individualized perspective.
