One of the mainstays of efficient and significant clinical practice is ensuring that every professional is engaged in continuous education and advancement. The execution of evidence-based practice is a straightforward way to offer such an opportunity to nurses, enabling them to utilize pertinent research to execute better, modernized, and patient-centered interventions. According to Koota et al. (2021), “the EBP educational intervention implemented in this study had a positive impact on emergency nurses’ EBP attitudes, knowledge, self-efficacy, skills, and behavior” (p. 23). Therefore, the introduction of EBP, by all means, is a positive alteration for the clinical setting.
However, it has been established in terms of the practicum that the implementation of EBP is currently restricted in the Memorial Regional Hospital in Hollywood, Florida. The concern is mostly associated with the heavy workload of the staff and limited costs assigned to the educational interventions. Presently, the management of the hospital is inclined towards funding actions and interventions effective in the short term. Meanwhile, EBP, denoting an innovative approach to practice, can potentially save money on substituting old time-consuming, and less efficient interventions.
The two primary implications of this concern for nursing include the incapacity to access quality education and increased likelihoods of emotional and physical burnout. Indeed, when nurses have no access to pertinent scholarly research, they are less likely to secure positive patient outcomes and acquire knowledge. With the incapacity to execute more time-efficient and innovative practices, nurses are also at risk of grappling with a heavy workload. Furthermore, according to Sultana et al. (2020), EBP can offer evidence-based approaches to decrease burnout rates among nurses. For this reason, this concern requires more attention in clinical settings nationwide.
