One method in which sociology can provide a valuable contribution to the comprehension of the connection between ethnicity and health discrepancies is by formulating a practical interpretation of ethnicity that highlights its relevant facets. Even today, despite the widespread acceptance of the social construction of ethnicity, the notion of ethnicity is frequently influenced by the ideas of physical anthropology and genetic inheritance. A proper sociological strategy regarding the issue of ethnicity concerning health discrepancies may alleviate it by concentrating on the stratifying principles of ethnicity, such as economic disadvantages and bias (Hummer, 1996). This strategy will enable a focus on the economic factors most pertinent as social determinants of health and, thereby, facilitate a better comprehension of causal relationships. Another and more detailed method in which sociology might clarify the link between ethnicity and health discrepancies is by emphasizing the ecological context of health. For example, sociology can be very beneficial in explaining the availability of opportunities for a healthier lifestyle and, particularly, nourishment. Kwate (2008) provides an illustration of what can be achieved in this regard in the examination of the connection between residential isolation and fast-food concentration. His approach involves examining the demographic, financial, physical, and social attributes of a community to discern why fast-food establishments are established on a larger scale in segregated black communities (Kwate, 2008). By doing so, Kwate (2008) redirects attention from the simplistic explanations and assumptions that can mislead the discussion of the issue in an inappropriate direction â€“ such as the assumption that blacks prefer fast foods more. Therefore, as in the situation above, the sociological approach enables a concentration on the actual structural factors behind the interrelation between ethnicity and health discrepancies.
