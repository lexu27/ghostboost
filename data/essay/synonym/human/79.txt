Introduction
The progression of data and communication technology offers a new opportunity for formulating company strategies focused on customer value co-creation. This is particularly evident in the financial sector, specifically in the banking domain. In this scenario, the competitive procedure can be supported by electronic banking operations. Financial services are presently developing alongside technological progress. Customers always had to visit the financial institution directly to carry out activities with their finances. However, with the advancement of technologies, the same tasks were permitted to be executed remotely with the aid of digital banking (e-banking).
Today, e-banking signifies a financial information system provided by the bank utilizing contemporary wireless technology to facilitate the swift and straightforward execution of financial transactions. The purpose of this paper is to examine the realm of digital banking and investigate the association between e-banking and customer contentment. The importance of our study lies in the crucial matters of electronic banking and the areas of enhancement that the banks can eradicate or enhance to enhance customer contentment. To enhance customer contentment with e-banks, enterprises must boost the following factors: speed of operations, reliability, security and privacy, and a customer-centric approach.
Literature Review
In the last 10-20 years, financial institutions have substantially shifted from conventional financing to E-banking (Khatoon, Zhengliang, and Hussain, 2020). The surges of advancement and technical breakthroughs assisted banks in broadening their clientele and E-banking products, which facilitated financial services to thrive and become more reachable (Khatoon, Zhengliang, and Hussain, 2020). Customers now can observe monitor their account balances, conduct cash transactions, deposit funds, message, and transfer payments to other individuals and companies using guidelines provided to their smartphones by institutions.
Electronic banking is also recognized as internet or mobile banking. These are platforms that banks may utilize to provide customers with easier access to services (Nurhadi and Ilfitriah, 2020). Specifically, a customer utilizing online banking does so via a computer connected to the internet, while a consumer using banking applications does so using a smartphone or tablet (Khatoon, Zhengliang, and Hussain, 2020). As per Khatoon, Zhengliang, and Hussain (2020), wireless utilization of e-banking illustrates the differentiation between the two kinds of banking settings, while users regard flexibility to be among the most crucial aspects of the electronic banking business. The most critical aspect of electronic banking is its reliability (Haq and Awan, 2020). More notably, bank customers believe that major online financial institutions are being employed, even though digital banking is the most cost-effective route.
Customer Satisfaction
Customer satisfaction is among the pivotal subjects in consumer research today. In general, it links the purchasing process to post-purchasing phenomena, encompassing attitude alteration, purchase frequency, and brand recognition (Al Ali, 2021). According to Hammoud, Bizri, and El Baba (2018), a sense of delight occurs when customers share their impression of the products or services and when their experiences align with the expectations. Thus, satisfaction levels correlate directly with the functionality of banks’ applications and services.
Defining customer satisfaction, a range of definitions have been put forth. Nevertheless, the notion of evaluating service execution and assumptions seems to be shared by most interpretations. Hammoud, Bizri, and El Baba (2018) portray satisfaction as a positive post-purchase evaluation judgment about a product or service. Similarly, Banu, Mohamed, and Parayitam (2019) described customer satisfaction as a customer response to the evaluation of the perceived disparity between expectations and outcomes after usage. Satisfaction can also be characterized as the consequence of a post-purchase appraisal of a service or product compared to the prior-purchasing stage’s expectations.
Other studies, in contrast, have found that the influence exerted throughout the purchase and consumption stages of the products or services may also have a substantial impact on the user’s evaluations of contentment. Therefore, customer satisfaction is a customer’s feeling of pleasure or dissatisfaction after comparing a product’s or service’s effectiveness to their expectations (Carranza et al., 2021). Following these criteria and the context of this study, customer satisfaction is the overall user’s viewpoint formed in response to utilizing any form of E-Banking service. Consequently, E-Banking attributes may enhance, diminish, or sustain the same level of customer contentment.
Customer Satisfaction and E-Banking
With numerous studies pointing to a connection between e-banking customer experience and customer happiness, the challenge lies in the definition of services or products that render customers increasingly happy and satisfied. According to our study’s examination of the literature, the following factors play a significant role in customer satisfaction: speed of operations, reliability, security and privacy, and a customer-centric approach (Usman, Monoarfa, and Marsofiyati, 2020). With the appropriate blend of these components, an e-banking institution will be able to elevate the level of customer satisfaction. Furthermore, to expand the customer base, Alabsy (2018) recommends banks to create a broader awareness of the service complexity.
The speed of operations denotes the pace of fund transfers, payments, fund withdrawals, or fund deposits. Reliability in this context can be defined as the overall trustworthiness of the application and the security of its usage. Additionally, security and privacy prove to play a significant role in the assessment of satisfaction levels. In the event an organization has a poor reputation and a scandalous history, the level of confidence in the company can significantly decline. The final factor, the customer-centric approach, is responsible for the prompt response of the support team. Appropriate responses from support teams can alter the perceptions of customers significantly.
Methodology
The provided research is based on the qualitative method, which concentrates on the collection and analysis of the gathered information. Among the selected variables were the e-banks such as PayPal Bank, WebMoney Bank, and Payoneer Bank. The chosen sample was a group of five individuals who voluntarily opted to partake in the study and exchange their views on their experiences while testing the aforementioned banks, particularly their services. The selected group evaluated in one day and shared their outcomes via a Google platform.
As previously noted, the reviewed literature has identified the following elements like the ones that contribute to customer satisfaction from e-banks: speed of operations, reliability, security and privacy, and a customer-centric approach. Thus, the group of volunteers was requested to test the applications of the banks and rate the specified variables from 1 to 5, which in subsequent stages of the research aided in comprehending the correlation between the mentioned factors and the level of satisfaction. To gather the data accurately, a platform such as Google Forms was utilized.
According to the findings, the e-bank WebMoney Bank delivered the lowest results and, thus, did not result in customer satisfaction. Conversely, all five participants awarded PayPal Bank the highest ratings for speed of operations, reliability, security and privacy, and a customer-centric approach. Hence, the findings indicated that these factors significantly influenced customer satisfaction. Nonetheless, the conducted research entails constraints, which could lead to subpar results. Among the limitations is the sample size, which might be deemed insufficient for robust statistical data. Moreover, the chosen individuals could be biased towards the mentioned e-banks, which could distort the evidence. Lastly, time restrictions also
