The Hippocratic Pledge, formulated in the fifth century B.C., is among history’s earliest scripts. Although the creators intended it to be a formal pledge, contemporary physicians view it as a promise to safeguard the art of healing and operate in the patient's best interest. Over time, the healthcare sector has adjusted the pledge to mirror shifts in healthcare and society. One variation of the pledge was drafted by Dr. Louis Lasagna in 1948.
The most significant contrast between the original pledge and the contemporary version is the invocation. The conventional form of the pledge, for example, is sworn by Apollo and other Greek deities of healing. Nowadays, variations of the pledge are sworn by anything sacred, or they commence simply with a vow to uphold medical principles. Furthermore, Dr. Louis Lasagna emphasizes one crucial aspect, “I will not hesitate to admit “I do not know.” This underlines the importance of recognizing that nobody possesses all knowledge, but there is always room for enhancement.
Furthermore, in the original pledge, a physician is depicted as an entity fulfilling their obligations. They also vow to steer clear of the "temptation" of their patients, "whether they are free or enslaved," which appears inappropriate. In contrast, the contemporary version presents a physician as "an integral part of society" who not only fulfills their responsibilities but also respects their patients.
Therefore, the Pledge of Hippocrates does prioritize the patient's welfare, but it is tailored to the circumstances of that era. In contrast, Dr. Louis Lasagna's pledge resonates more with my principles and ethics. I prioritize the patient's welfare and believe in the importance of maintaining compassion and respect while fulfilling my duties. Additionally, I perceive the aspect of not being embarrassed by personal ignorance as crucial since it can always serve as an incentive to acquire new knowledge.
