Television has “aided transform the distinct Negro into the proud Black,” has “given women an external view of their confinement in the home… enriched their charisma and prestige (Nye, 2006).” I picked this excerpt because it demonstrates how technology can be employed in the educational system to educate students by viewing educational programs on television. This aligns with the educational system as television supported a black American to evolve into a proud and self-respecting individual in society due to the informative programs he or she watched on television. This corresponds with how technology can be utilized in schools to bolster learning. The insight that this excerpt imparts when considering using technology in the future is integrating it into learning. Students learn to envision technological resolutions to problems that impact them, and in doing so, they transform their imaginations (Nye, 2006). Technology in contemporary times pertains to numerous sectors, including manufacturing, education, health, and governance. Presently, technology is being used to shape this world. Globalization and innovation surges have produced both losers and winners. The winners’ category encompasses entrepreneurs, investors, and high-skilled workers who have embraced new innovations and rapidly expanding markets. The losers are individuals who rely on high-cost labor markets because their competencies cannot match the pace of globalizing markets and technological evolution. Consequently, technological progressions such as the utilization of robots result in disruption in the job markets. Robots are utilized in various fields encompassing medical and education. Robots play a crucial role in the operating theater where they aid in intricate surgeries like cardiac valve repair. Robots can substitute human surgeons because they can perform what humans cannot. They also aid individuals with severe speech and hearing disabilities. Robots have also been embraced in some nations to serve as teaching aides in computer and science classes (Ross, 2016). Robots also facilitate communication in students with autism. Therefore, educators need to educate their students on the necessity to welcome technology such as robots because that is where the future lies. In this contemporary technology-focused era, educators need to impart robotics to students throughout their educational journey to enhance their ability to be inventive and imaginative thinkers and become more productive individuals in society. Educators would have to advocate for regulations and establish initiatives that would incorporate robotics into the education system. Parents and teachers are encouraged to embrace technology and educate it to their students and children. Technological transformations and globalization denote new prospects for all individuals including governments, enterprises, parents, children, students, and investors (Ross, 2016). Thus, the new innovations aim at enhancing the lives of numerous individuals worldwide. The big data explosion implies that this has altered how people learn both in informal and formal settings. Big data and analytics assist industries and commerce in adding value to their manufacturing. Big data applications can be implemented in any industry or commerce to boost their production and operations. The gathering of data supports the efficient evaluation of programs, interventions, and resources to promote school, student, and nation’s triumph. Companies or industries can utilize big data to profile their consumers comprehensively enabling the business to interact with them instantly. Companies can more effectively identify operational challenges, comprehend their consumers, manage supply chains, and detect fraudulent transactions through big data applications. Big data enables New Zealand to enhance its dairy and beef production for export to China (Ross, 2016). Companies that fail to adjust to big data applications are destined to perish in the current big data-driven economies.
