On the right side, modern data analysis provides opportunities that can be utilized to enhance current organizational practices by expanding the business, making operations efficient, and supporting meaningful causes. Through extensive data, modern data analysis plays a crucial role in how the company will stay ahead of business practices by predicting potential needs and issues (Khine, 2019). Currently, modern data analysis dominates the healthcare industry by reducing operational expenses and pinpointing efficiencies. Nevertheless, to enhance current organizational practices, data analysis will empower the company to eradicate diseases, reduce, if not prevent, unnecessary damages, manage infections, and extract the most valuable data from the existing dataset.
To ensure ongoing enhancement in the company, the following three procedures could be implemented. The PDCA, or the Deming cycle, offers a methodical process to improve products or services by recognizing, examining, and designing tests and pondering viable solutions to the issue (Hamm, 2016). The Kaizen process will enable the company to utilize standardized continuous improvement methods by becoming second nature for every staff member. The Six Sigma process will boost the business by eradicating errors (Hamm, 2016). Data analysis trends can enhance current practices by identifying decision areas where clinicians excel and replicate the level of success. Additionally, through data analysis trends, the company can also pinpoint areas where clinicians are underperforming and provide evidence to assist the business in shaping its decision-making process (Hamm, 2016). In essence, data analysis trends can aid the business in tracking successful metrics in clinical decisions through predictive analytics to minimize potential risks.
The pertinent and optimal practices to direct proposal communication to stakeholders involve formulating a strategy that outlines the necessity to involve them. A strategy makes it feasible to engage the stakeholders, and an anticipation of what the result might be is foreseen. Furthermore, a strategy serves as a critical guiding principle that delineates every engagement step from defining the content to potential attainable results (Winter, 2019). However, gaining acceptance from all stakeholders may not be straightforward. Some common obstacles include variances in decision-makers, conflicting priorities, resource constraints, and differing opinions and data.
Overcoming these challenges necessitates thoughtful consideration of the best strategies to persuade all stakeholders' acceptance. The approaches to utilize would be identifying the stakeholders and monitoring their actions, listening to their contributions, scheduling a meeting with each stakeholder, and discerning their motivators. Once the approaches are in place, stakeholders can be convinced by identifying and aligning their requirements with those of the organization (Bakken, 2018). Furthermore, with engagement and backing from senior management, it becomes feasible to monitor and gauge progress by providing feedback to the group and addressing potential concerns.
