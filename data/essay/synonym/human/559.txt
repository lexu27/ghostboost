Thich Quang Duc executed self-immolation on the streets of Saigon on June 11, 1963, and it altered the trajectory of history. Today, the photograph of Thich Quang Ducâ€™s demise, The Burning Monk, has evolved into a universal symbol of rebellion and the battle against injustice. His demise was minimized to a symbol, but it was far more than that (Sinzelle, 22). It was an act of defiance against a corrupt government that had terminated its citizens. It triggered a revolution, toppled the regime, and may even have prompted the Americans to engage in the Vietnam War. Nonetheless, the monk himself most likely did not perish for revolutionary concepts. His self-immolation was an act of repudiation of the system and the incapacity to cope with injustice.
Tunisian street vendor Mohammed Bouazizi ignited himself in protest against harassment by local officials. The desperate deed of the young man incited mass street protests in the city. The rioters demanded the resignation of President Ben Ali. His political regime confronted long-term economic and social predicaments, resulting in unemployment, predominantly among young people. Mohammed Bouazizi materialized as a symbol of the Arab Spring; he garnered adherents in Tunisia and other Arab nations, which also triggered mass protests.
The majority of the self-immolations did not impact the current situation; nevertheless, some of them played a pivotal role in the political events in the country in which they transpired. The actions of both men can scarcely be labeled a specific call for revolution. Both instances can be juxtaposed, viewing them as an extreme measure of dissent with injustice. It emerges that the men have no alternative means left for the official authorities to heed them. In one manner or another, both occurrences significantly influenced the trajectory of history.
