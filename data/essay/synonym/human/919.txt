Ethnic background, tradition, and faith are fundamental components that significantly influence each personâ€™s character. Simultaneously, these components frequently spark challenging discussions and can even lead to disagreements. As an individual who has encountered bias on numerous occasions, I am convinced that engaging in dialogues with others about race and cultural heritage is crucial, and I am consistently open to taking part in them. I have faced discrimination from the age of about seven. My parents hail from different towns in Yemen, and relatives from both sides would occasionally discuss with me how their heritage surpasses the other. Upon relocating to Qatar, I was met with disparaging remarks and assumptions about my nationality and economic status in my homeland. In the United States, I encountered new prejudiced encounters, this time related to my faith. Nonetheless, these encounters have led to personal growth, learning, and a deeper appreciation for my heritage, faith, and ethnic background. Furthermore, whenever I am singled out by individuals harboring unfavorable opinions about me, I make an effort to engage them in conversation. I do not take offense at their remarks because I recognize that their viewpoints stem from their lack of knowledge. Hence, I consistently endeavor to enlighten individuals and share my beliefs and cultural heritage with them. Consequently, I am highly proficient in such discussions and always eager to participate since, in most instances, individuals genuinely alter their perspectives, acknowledge their errors, and sometimes even offer apologies.
