Ethnicity, culture, and religion are essential elements which to a considerable extent, shape every individual â€™ s personality. At the same time, these elements often become a topic of difficult conversations and even sources of conflict. As a person who has faced discrimination on numerous occasions, I believe that holding conversations with people about race and cultural identity is important, and I am always willing to participate in them. I have experienced racialism ever since I was about seven years old. My parents are from different cities in Yemen, and both side of meat of the family would sometimes have conversations with me on how their culture is better than the other. After migrating to Qatar, I encountered negative comments and assumptions about my nationality and poverty in my home country. In the United States, I faced new racist fundamental interaction, this time concerning my religion. Still, these experiences have made me grow as a person, learn, and appreciate my culture, religion, and ethnicity. Moreover, every time I am targeted by people holding negative views about me, I attempt to have a conversation with them. Unity do not get appal by their word because I understand that their perspectives stem from their ignorance. Therefore, I always strive to educate people and tell them about my beliefs and cultural background. As a result, I am highly skilled in such conversations and always willing to engage in them since, in the majority of cases, people actually change their attitudes, recognize their mistakes, and even apologize.
