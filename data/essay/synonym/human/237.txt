Electric vehicles have only recently started to rival the internal combustion engine, but they have been actively utilized by drivers for over a century. These vehicles were particularly popular at the beginning of the 20th century but declined in popularity when Ford's moving assembly line expanded the availability of passenger vehicles (Simpson 2021). The utilization of electric cars offers various benefits, including their eco-friendliness, maintenance cost, and intriguing history of the emergence of innovative technology.
The design of an electric car is not inferior to regular passenger vehicles and might even be deemed safer than conventional models. The primary structural components of an electric vehicle are battery, electric motor, gearbox, on-board charger, inverter, DC converter, and electronic control system. The construction of an electric car implies the lack of a clutch and transmission, which is why they accelerate more smoothly and ascend slopes more easily (Magnusson 2017). Such a vehicle does not contain engine oil and spark plugs, which lowers maintenance expenses. Electric cars also operate quietly, produce minimal noise, and do not contribute to noise pollution. The motor also consumes no power when the vehicle is stationary. The transmission of an electric car is quite straightforward. With the on-board charger, the vehicle can be powered from the household electrical grid. Thus, a simple and comprehensible vehicle design can contribute to their prevalence.
Climate scientists argue that the electrification of vehicles is one of the most effective methods to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Fully electric cars run using a large electric battery and do not emit exhaust fumes. Electric vehicles are becoming increasingly environmentally friendly over time, despite the more intensive battery production process. Conventional gasoline-powered cars are the least eco-friendly choice, with long-term expenses and emissions spanning a wide spectrum. This diminishes the risk of fatalities from accidents and exposure to exhaust fumes on an individual's respiratory system. According to Dr. Tranchik's approximations, the production emissions of electric vehicles will be offset within six months, depending on the cleanliness of the power grid from which the car is charged.
Electric cars have lower popularity than gasoline-powered vehicles due to their higher initial price. The battery capacity cost should also be factored in since a vehicle that can run longer on a single charge will be more expensive. However, empirical research demonstrates that electric cars enable drivers to save money in the long term. A team from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology computed the total life cost of the vehicle (comprising the purchase price, maintenance, fuel) and determined that electric cars are much more cost-effective for owners (Penney 2021). Presently, electric vehicles are becoming safer, more affordable, and, when produced by prominent brands, are starting to be mass-marketed. The global leader in electric vehicle sales is Norway, which aims to cease selling gasoline-powered cars by 2025. New Zealand follows a similar strategy due to environmental concerns. The dissemination of such studies could help lower the financial burdens associated with vehicle usage.
The proliferation of electric vehicles necessitates the expansion of infrastructure and enhanced accessibility. Despite electric cars becoming more prevalent on roads, only a select few nations are approaching their widespread adoption. Nevertheless, electric vehicles will serve as an excellent substitute for traditional gasoline vehicles and enhance the environmental situation.
