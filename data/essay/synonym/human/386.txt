English is the easiest form of communication accessible between individuals from various parts of the globe. It persists as an indisputable reality that most individuals persist in talking with an accent even following numerous years of acquiring the language. This reality produces an extensive surge of bias, notably from indigenous speakers. The reality is that even they commence to alter their language to accomplish a specific distinctiveness and dissimilarity, particularly in the imaginative field. The accent, which is so challenging to eliminate when conversing in another language, is that our ear becomes accustomed to sifting through frequencies from childhood that are unnecessary to comprehend native speakers. It is crucial to understand that conversing with an accent is common, that this is not a basis to discriminate against an individual. However, conversely, it is a remarkable chance to support them enhance their language.
The strategy of multiculturalism, which is the parallel coexistence of diverse cultures, is adjacent to the social movement "The English only movement." The latter energetically promotes establishing uniform standards of the American literary language for Caucasians and African Americans (Park Hong). Various political and socio-economic actions devised to eliminate the country of racist biases have not yet been successful. In modern sociolinguistics, a distinct spot is granted to language as a social activity that establishes power dynamics among representatives of various racial and class groups.
The sensation of their alienation, "otherness" in a mostly still segregated American society generates tensions between migrants and the native population. The complexion, the dimension of the eyes or nose endure as an unyielding partition dividing the universe of migrants from the remainder of Americans. Although in recent years, there has been a substantial advancement in the material and social state (Park Hong). The Asian encounter is not the solitary one that demonstrates that language discrimination is still strong, although its boundaries are notably blurred (Kim 4). Migrants from Russia, Latin America, and the Middle East consistently encounter discrimination. It is predominantly due to the intricacy of their mother tongue, which is not as simple to master faultlessly (Ingham). The English language will be perceived very inadequately in such circumstances, even with numerous years of study experience.
Linguistic appropriation as one of the manifestations of cultural appropriation is perceived in the USA as a continuation of the privilege of the white populace. White America does not correctly allude to primary sources, disregards the historical context, and upholds stereotypes about migrants. The language of migrants becomes the target of continual criticism from the public and the basis for linguistic bias (Kim 7). This language is linked not with a sign of ethnicity and a means of self-identification of its speakers but with their degree of education and intellectual capacities.
Nonetheless, it is valuable to acknowledge that discrimination is commencing to enhance, predominantly owing to creativity. Various musical artists most frequently become renowned in the United States as migrants (Ingham). They prosper by purposely simplifying or complicating the language, not merely profanity. This encounter reveals fuzzy boundaries, and there is a softening of edges regarding a conversation with an accent. It is insignificant where you are from, South Asia or the Middle East, Africa, or Russia; this will not evolve into an impediment to dialogue.
The uneven relationship between Americans and migrants is directly mirrored in linguistic occurrences. With any level of English proficiency, you can be comprehended and heard, not solely in the USA but also worldwide. It is imperative to relinquish the fear of speaking and inscribing on social networks in a language that is not native to you. It is a crucial realization that leads to linguistic liberty in the USA.
