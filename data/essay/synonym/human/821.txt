Cultural modesty is a notion that must be integrated into human service establishments to enhance the efficiency, receptiveness, and availability of rendered services. The concept of cultural modesty arose approximately 30 years ago, which was initially introduced by Melanie Tervalon and Jane Murray-Garcia. Cultural modesty was recognized as “a lifelong commitment to self-assessment and criticism, to rectifying power imbalances… and to cultivating mutually advantageous and non-paternalistic partnerships with communities on behalf of individuals and defined populations” (Greene-Moton & Minkler, 2020, p. 142). In essence, cultural modesty heightens caregivers' consciousness about the culture of service recipients through self-examination and contemplation.
Although the majority of human service establishments comprehend the significance of cultural modesty; nevertheless, not every establishment has a declaration of cultural modesty/safety. Connecticut Coalition to End Homelessness (CCEH, 2015) possesses such a declaration which is termed “Cultural Competency and Responsiveness.” The declaration admits that the establishment offers services to progressively diverse populations in terms of race, cultural heritage, language, age, gender, and sexual orientation (CCEH, 2015). The declaration provides explanations for cultural competency, cultural modesty, and cultural responsiveness. Furthermore, the declaration delineates the population it caters to, showcasing awareness about the issue, which is vital for delivering top-notch services. Additionally, it presents a roster of resources that were utilized to steer the operations of the establishment in terms of cultural safety.
While the declaration is satisfactory, there are two notable shortcomings. Firstly, the establishment does not detail how the tenets of cultural safety were put into practice. Hence, it is advised that CCEH showcases instances of how the dedication to cultural safety resulted in enhancements in day-to-day operations. Secondly, the establishment places a heightened focus on cultural proficiency instead of cultural modesty. Unlike cultural proficiency, cultural modesty acknowledges the incapacity to grasp the intricate nature of an individual’s culture (Greene-Moton & Minkler, 2020). Meanwhile, cultural modesty commits to learning about the culture of others. Therefore, it is suggested that the establishment places a stronger emphasis on cultural modesty.
If I were the head of the establishment, I would strive to find a means for interacting with some of the factions of younger homeless individuals in Connecticut. For example, the establishment acknowledges that over 30% of the served population are young Hispanics (CCEH, 2015). This demographic might encounter difficulties communicating with service providers. However, if the establishment enlisted a bilingual young adult to communicate with the population, it would yield a more substantial impact on the results. Such a practice would enhance the establishment's cultural modesty practices.
