The TED Discussions are demonstrations of bio-psycho-social-spiritual developmental concerns that ultimately generate situations in which specific individuals do not feel entirely integrated into society. For instance, Smith (2015) mentions the variances associated with raising a white and a black child. Abdel-Magied (2014), conversely, illustrates how a garment alters the way individuals interact with, perceive, and assess Muslim women. It is definite that prejudice commences with bias, which is a multi-layered concept. An essay released by New York Times (2016) discusses the ordeals of non-white individuals in the US, which frequently coincide with the absence of a sense of belonging.
This is also perpetuated by prejudice, which shapes distinct outlooks where individuals tend to prefer one group of individuals over another. The prejudice can be automatic, uncertain, and mixed depending on its attributes and how it appears in relation to people’s perspectives on specific groups of persons (Fiske, 2022). Although such occurrences have never been directly encountered, it is clear that the existences of individuals I am acquainted with have been influenced in terms of self-respect and assurance, which can frequently be adversely affected because of prejudice. I wish to investigate racial bias due to its importance in today’s era, particularly how it exhibits itself on structural levels.
