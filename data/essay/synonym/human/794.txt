There is an unfavorable impact of the opioid epidemic on the United States. These substances typically lead to a dependency, and a more crucial aspect suggests that they do not tackle the root cause of pain. Instead, opioids induce a sense of euphoria that conceals suffering. That is why it is clear that there is no necessity to legalize heroin, indicating that alternative pain relievers should be developed.
Since heroin and other opioids adversely affect the entire nation, a logical step is to finance alternative treatments for pain. For instance, some researchers contemplate utilizing marijuana as a pain reliever, but this substance also carries some health hazards, signifying that this decision should be made cautiously (Saloner et al., 2018). However, if medical scientists succeed in discovering an alternative pain management medication, numerous advantages will ensue. Specifically, this choice will result in enhanced patient safety because opioid misuse is a primary cause of peopleâ€™s demise (Saloner et al., 2018). For instance, over 60,000 individuals succumbed to a drug overdose in 2016 (Saloner et al., 2018). Moreover, a notable benefit will pertain to cost savings because utilizing an alternative pain reliever will not generate individuals who will necessitate additional services. That is why there is no uncertainty that it is crucial to invest in alternative pain management medications.
In summary, it has been recognized that the opioid crisis is a significant obstacle for the United States. This issue leads to thousands of injured and deceased individuals, indicating that alternative pain relievers should be discovered. Marijuana is a viable choice, but the potential detrimental effects of this substance explain why the healthcare sector has not initiated its use. In any event, researchers should seek alternative pain relievers to safeguard patients and diminish healthcare expenses.
