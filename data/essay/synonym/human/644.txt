Text: Introduction
Individuals’ behaviors and choices are frequently the primary focus of sociological investigation. Flint (Michigan) water crisis can be perceived as an example of such choices and behaviors that have resulted in severe problems with multiple consequences. To comprehend the reasons behind the crisis and methods to avert such issues in the future, it is feasible to utilize the Marxist approach. The class notion of this framework most fittingly aligns with the examination of the situation as a clash between two major groups is evident.
Flint (Michigan): Demographics
In the midst of the twentieth century, Flint (Michigan) was a rapidly growing and flourishing city that accommodated such titans as General Motors. Nevertheless, in the 1980s, the town began to deteriorate due to the profound oil crisis that impacted the automotive industry (Pauli, 2020). The city witnessed substantial demographic changes as thousands of individuals departed in search of better work opportunities and living conditions. Currently, the city’s population stands at slightly over 96 thousand individuals (Data USA, 2021). The majority of inhabitants are Black, and one-third is White. The poverty rate is relatively high and peaked at 39% in 2020, while the median age is quite low (35.5 years). These statistics indicate that the socio-economic situation in Flint is concerning, and significant alterations are imperative.
Water Crisis in Flint (Michigan)
The crisis commenced in 2014, and authorities in cooperation and oversight of the public and scientists were unable to resolve it until 2019. In 2014, officials had to alter the water source due to the challenges in maintaining the existing infrastructure (Krings et al., 2018). No prompt actions to upgrade the infrastructure were taken. That same year, individuals approached officials due to their discontent with water quality, which remained unaddressed. Following several investigations and data releases concerning extreme breaches of water quality standards (elevated lead level, harmful bacteria), officials were compelled to take action. Subsequently, pipes were replaced, and the necessary enhancement to the infrastructure was carried out with the assistance of federal budget funds.
Water Crisis in Flint (Michigan): Causes
One of the central issues that triggered the crisis was the city’s limitations associated with infrastructure. Flint’s budget could scarcely guarantee adequate maintenance of pipes and other infrastructure elements (Pauli, 2020). Owing to the economic circumstances in the city, the public had minimal influence over the actions and decisions of an emergency manager and Governor Rick Snyder. Residents reached out to the authorities, but their grievances received scant attention as the authorities focused on the economic advancement of the city rather than public health or safety.
Flint Water Crisis: Social Concept Applied
When investigating the causes of the crisis, it is indispensable to apply the concept of class. Although various scholars indicate that class is a subjective construct devised for analytical purposes, this idea is a pertinent component of population stratification (Neilson, 2017). Individuals identify with a specific group, such as laborers (proletariat) or large business proprietors (bourgeoisie). In Flint, this stratification is pertinent as there is nearly no middle class. Evidently, officials prioritized the needs of large businesses over laborers.
Marxist Theory: Class
According to the Marxist theory of class, human society is predominantly divided into the laborers (proletariat) and bourgeoisie (those who exploit laborers’ resources). The former are working individuals with limited resources as they are appropriated by the affluent (Neilson, 2017). These two groups are in perpetual conflict, and their resolution can be attained through revolution. The revolution can be executed peacefully through a coalition with a portion (minority) of bourgeois and proletariat or due to violent confrontation. Marx believed in the triumph of the proletariat and the establishment of communism with its equity and equitable distribution of resources.
Marxist Perspective Regarding the Crisis
In the scenario in Flint, the authorities sided with the bourgeoisie, disregarding potential consequences. Authorities made certain decisions to allocate funds to boost economic growth supporting businesses. However, the proletariat was the class deprived of superior living standards as indigent individuals had to reside in older communities with antiquated water pipes significantly contaminated. Water emerged as the pivotal resource in the conflict between the two classes. The proletariat emerged victorious in the conflict, which can be elucidated by the success of the peaceful revolution with the alliance of workers and a portion of business owners.
Marxist Perspective Regarding the Crisis (Social Concepts)
The examination of the crisis from the Marxist theory of class perspective facilitates a deeper exploration of concepts such as civil society and race. Civil society is perceived as a framework that brings equilibrium to society and guarantees that the interests of all groups are considered (Neilson, 2017). Race is another social concept that can be employed as the majority of the city’s residents are Black. The poverty rate within this demographic is also the highest (Data USA, 2021). This group encounters the most challenges in accessing proper living conditions (favorable neighborhoods), employment, and healthcare. They represent the most vulnerable group that was the primary force propelling civil society, leading to substantial enhancements and crisis resolution.
The Crisis from Bourdieu’s Perspective
The Flint water crisis can be examined from Bourdieu’s viewpoint predicated on the notion that classes are analytical constructions. Instead, distinct groups, with individuals joining and departing these clusters, collaborate or find themselves in conflict. There was no distinctly delineated working class in Flint, and big businesses vied for resources. Nonetheless, workers, unemployed individuals, small business proprietors, significant business owners, officials, scientists, and others were communicating and cooperating. These interactions aided the groups in resolving an issue that had adverse repercussions on all of them.
Conclusion
Marxist and Bourdieu’s viewpoints can both be applied to scrutinize the Flint Water crisis. It becomes evident that classes are objective creations, although they are not definitive. Workers, entrepreneurs, significant business owners, merchants, scientists, and employees possess diverse interests, and they may occasionally be at odds. Nonetheless, the requirements of individuals pertaining to various groups can be achieved through collaboration. The Flint Water Crisis serves as a demonstration of conflict and its resolution. Although the initial focus was on the interests of businesses and economic expansion at the expense of public health, individuals succeeded in compelling officials to make appropriate decisions and tackle the water predicament. The representation of diverse classes and clusters of society constituted the civil society that emerged as the force driving the solution. The authorities had to implement suitable measures to address the issue. It is evident that civil society can serve as a supervisory force to guarantee that officials make sound decisions.
