Social Disparity in the Gilded Age and Progressive Era
The Gilded Age was one of the United States’ most affluent epochs. Between 1870 and the early 20 th century, the nation accumulated riches at a rapid pace. The country appeared to be on a trajectory of financial steadiness, with everyone encouraged to join in, but this was an illusion. The Gilded Age was splendid on the surface but harbored decay beneath. It transitioned into the Progressive Era that aimed to rectify the injustices of the Gilded Age with arguably significant success. It was a period of intensified social activism. In this document, I explore the social inequities endured by minority communities in these epochs, how they endeavored to resolve them, and the depiction of these pivotal periods of American history in the textbooks.
Social Disparities Faced by Minority Groups
One of the trademarks of the Gilded Age was widespread disparity. This form of unfairness broadly manifested in two ways; social and economic (Cashman, 293). With the emergence of corporations that provided employment for all those ready to work, the influx of millions of immigrants from Europe and the Far East was a welcomed sight; or so it was believed to be. It resulted in the rise of the appalling condition of laborers in the republic. The workforce outnumbered the available jobs, leading to mass unemployment. The majority of the migrant populace was unskilled, and the absence of factory positions equated to zero income.
Securing a job was not illustrious, perhaps merely the lesser evil at most. Laborers in these enterprises overseen by excessively astute entrepreneurs who prioritized productivity above everything else were remunerated meager wages for their toils. They had to endure hazardous working environments without recompense for injuries sustained while on duty. This, combined with the exorbitant rent imposed by landlords, made the cost of subsistence for the newly arrived immigrants exorbitant. The expense was so high that most immigrants were compelled to reside in congested, unhygienic, and crime-ridden tenement yards, all in pursuit of the American Dream.
The bulk of the social unfairness during the Gilded Age was perpetuated by trusts and firms operating monopolies and the ‘robber barons’ who aimed to establish full-fledged capitalism. Andrew Carnegie, Cornelius Vanderbilt, and JPMorgan are among them. Stating that wealth distribution in the US was unequal would be a significant understatement. Four thousand families, constituting 1% of the population, controlled as much wealth as 11.6 million. The financial magnates who amassed their fortunes in various sectors of the economy insisted on production at any cost, a cost primarily borne by the laboring man. The anecdotes, such as one of Carnegie unleashing a small army on his laborers, are rather alarming.
Efforts to Tackle the Disparities
With the Progressive Era came reforms; individuals united to put an end to the social injustice they had long been subjected to. The populist movement of Agrarian reforms, the antitrust movements, and the progressive movement of urban social reformers emerged. It became apparent that the only way to make an impact was not through individual action but through a united effort to demand rights and equitable treatment (Cole, 297). Numerous policies to mitigate disparity were formulated and advocated. The challenge was that no framework or groundwork was laid to render them politically viable and pragmatic.
Loewen’s Evaluation of the Representation of these Disparities in Textbooks
Loewen is highly critical of how textbooks in the present day and in the past have portrayed the issue of class. This is evident in Lies my Teacher Told Me. He asserts that there is a general absence of class analysis in American History textbooks. It is nearly impossible to present class prejudice positively; to circumvent this and the ensuing controversy, textbooks provide blandly positive narratives of history, occasionally diverging from actual events. This is a deliberate effort to promote the concept of the American dream.
Migration, which has been a pivotal aspect of the nation’s narrative since independence from Great Britain, is allocated an unjust and superficial segment in history textbooks. They handle the subject matter in figures, presenting statistics and non-descriptive details on the migrants. Their challenges in their voyages to America and their new existence on the continent take a backseat. Only the migrants whose lives culminated in fame through some act are showcased. The same applies to African Americans and serves only to reinforce the rags-to-riches storyline, which, while motivating, tends to blame the impoverished individual for their destitution.
Loewen also suggests that class bias in textbooks has been exploited as a mechanism to further enrich the affluent as they ‘deserve’ it and to compel the working class to acknowledge their status in society. In an attempt to discredit class bias, textbooks portray it as archaic disputes unworthy of recollection (Loewen, 137). Even the legislation that bolsters the affluent individual’s position is downplayed at the expense of the less privileged. In chapter 7, Loewen faults society for class bias in textbooks. Until recently, authors were stigmatized as Marxists for addressing class matters in their publications. Given today’s society inching closer to resembling a second gilded age, textbooks should lead the charge in ensuring that social disparity does not resurface.
Policies during the Progressive era contributed to the decline of blacks, migrants, and laborers. Instead of reducing monopoly and disparity, the government established a super monopoly and elevated the pursuit of privilege and rent-seeking as a principle. Not all aspects are truthfully depicted in textbooks concerning how life was structured at that time. Therefore, to prevent the recurrence of past errors, contemporary textbooks must provide accurate information to avert the mistakes of the past.
