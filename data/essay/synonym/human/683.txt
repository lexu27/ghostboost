Caring for individuals is a challenging task, and even the most skilled physician will not be able to handle it single-handedly. Nurses are a crucial connection in the operation of the healthcare system and the process of preserving the lives of the public. Reflecting on my past, I encounter occurrences that guided me to the profession of a nurse. People's encounters significantly shape their personality and ideas, which influences many life decisions (Woźniak, 2019). My involvement in various situations helped me recognize my calling. These circumstances in my life may appear routine, but for me, they have turned out to be pivotal and those that demonstrate that all incidents are not random at all.

Matters of challenges and obstacles individuals encounter, such as global issues and similar worries, have preoccupied my thoughts since childhood. I pondered what could be done to alter something. In return, considerations arise about altering the world, ecological demonstrations, the innovation of technologies that will safeguard the ocean. Nevertheless, even though these actions are crucial, they seemed inappropriate for my personality, and I desired to engage in something more practical and impactful. These reflections are the primary basis that guided me to the profession of a nurse. For me, medicine and compassion transform the world for the better. Furthermore, without them, humanity would have never attained the contemporary standard of living. Transforming the lives of even one patient positively is also as significant as transforming the entire world.

Many of us had some encounter with sickness and even being in hospitals during childhood. Such a circumstance occurred to me – I had to remain in the medical facility for therapy for several days. Being a child, I was frightened and anxious, particularly at night. Nonetheless, there was a nurse who succeeded in pacifying me and assisting me. She even allowed me to address her by her name, Tina, and I sensed that we developed a friendship. I consistently remembered her with happiness, and as I matured, I comprehended how valuable and significant her deeds were for a young child. This event was the second rationale that led me to the profession of a nurse – I perceived that there are numerous individuals in the world who, like me back then, require the same support and solace, and I can offer it to them.

We have to address ailments and injuries not exclusively in hospital settings but also in emergencies in any situation. Family members, acquaintances, and even strangers may suddenly become sick or injured, and it is imperative to respond swiftly – since saving a life can hinge on a few seconds. As an adolescent, I witnessed my friend fracture his arm. We were fortunate, and there was an individual close by who could render assistance, and the ambulance arrived promptly. Nevertheless, for a few minutes, I felt powerless and perplexed – I aspired to provide assistance but did not wish to cause harm. This occurrence was another rationale that urged me to opt for becoming a nurse. Proficiency in first aid, and even simple aid in assessing pressure, can be life-saving.

Hence, numerous pivotal occurrences and lengthy contemplations when making decisions underlie my choice to become a nurse. I perceive numerous benefits in the role of nurses and have faith in their distinct significance. Preserving lives and offering solace and care to numerous individuals are what I aspire to do. Kindness, attentiveness, and support are what our world necessitates, and these attributes can bring prosperity to the public.
