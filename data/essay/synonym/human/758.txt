One might argue that the brief narrative “Where Are You Going, Where Have You Been?” possesses a suitable open conclusion that both mirrors the legendary quality of the occurrences happening to Connie while also offering adequate proof to show what had transpired to her. On one side, the reader comprehends that she was most probably killed, as “she sensed her breath commence jerking back and forth in her lungs as if it were something Arnold Friend was piercing her with again and again with no gentleness” (Oates). Nevertheless, when Connie regains awareness, she is encountering something akin to an out of body experience.
It is evident that she is deceased and moving towards the afterlife, but it raises numerous queries in the conclusion as to who Arnold Friend truly is, how is he all-knowing and seemingly almighty? There is always the possibility that it might be a dream, given that she ventured outside and could have drifted off knowing her tendency to daydream. The open conclusion emerges as to what lies ahead for Connie and whether she is entering paradise, or merely an illusion of it crafted by her murderer. Connie’s essence has seemingly transformed from her physical appearance, but the audience is never provided with the complete picture.
One crucial analysis by Samantha Conover proposes that Connie actually encountered an abduction and some form of rape or sexual assault. The narrative does not directly depict this but potentially employs euphemisms and other literary devices to imply that this influential, wealthy man, who most likely stalked her, was a sexual predator. It is understood that the brief tale was inspired by Oates on a real-life serial killer, who killed several young girls before capture, indicating a typology and form of sexual aggression displayed through his satisfaction when killing his victims. Connie’s circumstance mirrors that of numerous other women who have encountered sexual assault, she recognized the perpetrator but not closely, she was met alone, but in broad daylight, seemingly when no crime should transpire. Finally, her vulnerability and out-of-body experience could imply that she merely was traumatized to the extent of no longer having awareness of her own body (Conover 125). It is a terrifying, but sadly precise analogy drawn through imagery and metaphors in Oates' narrative, signifying that it might not have been legendary at all, but an instance of awful realism.
