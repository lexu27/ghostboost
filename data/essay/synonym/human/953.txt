Departing from societal customs could lead to a scale of advancement. Societal customs have a manner of dictating what to carry out and how to respond to specific circumstances. An establishment establishes regulations to be obeyed and challenging such customs is defined as defiance. Society, including mass media, is accustomed to depicting the black community as a melancholic one so observing them content appears like a breach of order. Displaying black joy might appear like opposition from the societal customs but will have a beneficial impact on the entire American society. Adam also had to defy God to be liberated from a pre-human condition to a human one. Hence, deviating from societal customs can result in numerous forms of advancement for humans.

Resisting the governing authority may seem like disobedience but can lead to significant human progress. For the African Americans, resisting the pessimistic customs of sorrow requires sharing more joy with the black community. Nevertheless, it will require more than individuals to produce favorable outcomes. The imaginative and media communities need to disseminate black joy to alter the black tradition of commemorating sorrow and suffering. Such actions would communicate the multiplicity of black culture, the necessity to occupy space, and claim their possessions. As per Roderique, sharing black joy “would create spaces of opportunity, possibility, and affirmation” (4). This statement confirms that resisting negative societal customs brings about favorable outcomes. Hence, if resistance is necessary to achieve progress, then in this scenario resistance is beneficial.

Deeds of defiance, though may seem incorrect initially, when they bring about freedom, they are perceived as right. When Adam and Eve disobeyed God in the Garden of Eden, they appeared to have been defiled by sin (Fromm 1). However, the sin or rather a defiant act transformed Adam from pre-human to human, and that denotes advancement. The text notes that it was not until the Messianic prophets arrived on earth that they affirmed that the act of disobedience was correct, and people comprehended the concept.

Humans have persistently progressed and evolved through acts of defiance. It is by questioning the authority or established societal customs that a person can thrive. Fromm asserts that compliance with the regulations or customs of a community or establishment is acquiescence and indicates a denial of independence (2). Consequently, humans remain fixed in one place while adhering to the established customs. However, once a person contests the regulations, he or she is labeled as disobedient but subsequently discovers progress. The choice to comply or disobey is a decision to stagnate or grow.

Adhering to regulations and societal customs established by the community is akin to consenting to the directives of the superego. According to Fromm “Super-Ego represents the internalized commands and prohibitions of father, accepted by the son out of fear” (3). Fear is recognized to establish boundaries and restrict the capabilities of individuals. Societal customs are created to restrict human capabilities, and it is only by breaking away from them that a person can thrive. If Roderique, when shared the cheerful post about Black Panther allowed fear to restrict her, she would not have crafted the passage. She would also not have written to urge for the black community to openly share the joy and shatter the societal norm of the despondent black community.

Defying established societal practices is a psychological process that must involve the readiness to transgress or make an error. Going against such customs will be labeled as immoral and rebellious, hence one must toughen up. Individuals can only liberate themselves from societal practices by learning to decline authority. When a person liberates themselves from authority and is psychologically liberated, he or she can progress positively.
