In order to thwart heart disease, cancer, and diabetes, individuals are obligated to stick to stringent regimens, particularly concerning diet. According to American Heart Association, individuals desiring to avert heart disease must ingest nourishment devoid of added sugars and elevated quantities of sodium, as well as saturated and trans fats (“Key Ingredients”). Furthermore, persons must consume whole grains, veggies including frozen and canned ones, nuts, seeds, and meat like chicken and lean beef. American Cancer Society’s dietary directives to individuals involve the necessity to consume more fruits and veggies, notably dark green and orange ones, as they possess a significant cancer prevention capability (“American Cancer Society”).
Furthermore, the society suggests individuals consume foods rich in fiber, like legumes and whole grains, while steering clear of red meats and added sugar. Lastly, American Diabetes Association advocates for consuming more non-starchy vegetables, like broccoli, carrots, cauliflower which should make up one-half of each meal (“Eat Well”). The association also emphasizes the importance of consuming foods high in protein, such as beans, hummus, and lentils, along with fruits and monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats.
The suggestions to deter the three aforementioned conditions are, to a large extent, similar. Essentially, all organizations emphasize that it is crucial to evade consuming added sugar and saturated and trans fat. Moreover, individuals interested in preventing heart disease, cancer, and diabetes also need to consume more fruits, vegetables, and chicken meat. Concurrently, red meat is strictly forbidden for cancer patients while generally permissible for individuals with diabetes and heart disease. People with diabetes should ingest more non-starchy vegetables than individuals with the other two conditions. Lastly, to avoid heart disease, individuals must particularly be cautious about consuming any form of fats.
