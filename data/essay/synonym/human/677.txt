This week concentrated on the second section of the textbook that examines the essence of individuals and civilization. The primary focal point is the recognition that civilization is the structure of life and impacts the facets of life for every person (De Melendez & Beck, 2018). Consequently, everything an individual does, how they perceive things, their attire, preferences and aversions, approach to social and political matters, and interaction with others is influenced by one’s civilization. This awareness will enhance how I perceive and connect with individuals at work and in social environments because diverse civilizations will generate different life approaches and styles.
It is essential to seek a rationale for classroom behavior among students. The subsequent idea from the text asserts that students’ etiquettes, behavior, and responses can be credited to their civilization (De Melendez & Beck, 2018). Therefore, suitable actions by one student may transform into unsuitable to another or to the educator. Since children start to absorb their civilization from birth, most of them will possess the behaviors inherited from guardians, elder siblings, and other close relatives. This insight will aid me in comprehending my students and devising the optimal encounters for every student in the classroom.
Lastly, despite civilization belonging to society, there exist variances between individuals in the same cultural groups. Such disparities are observed in a classroom where every student possesses a distinct way of expressing themselves and responding to various subjects. Hence, even individuals within the same family or community may display differing behaviors and etiquettes (De Melendez & Beck, 2018). Such distinctions arise from socialization and personal differences. Following this chapter, while in the classroom, I will handle each student as unique and culturally distinct to ensure each of them obtains the finest attention and guidance during the educational process.
