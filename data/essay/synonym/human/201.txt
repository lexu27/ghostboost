The strategy and thought process underlying the dissertation are elucidated in this chapter. This part is intended to furnish ample details for other researchers conducting investigations concerning the digitalization of the management accounting domain. Consequently, the academic embarks on delineating the exploration design, encompassing a portrayal of the study's concrete procedures. Subsequently, this document delves into the investigator's methodology, discoveries, suggestions, and presents constraints and future exploration.
Exploration Design
The exploration design is a comprehensive tactic for tackling the study concerns. A well-structured exploration design ensures that the exploration techniques align with the exploration aims, quality data gathering, and appropriate analysis to address the exploration queries using credible sources. Effective designs enable researchers to draw reliable, sound inferences. The design links the theoretical exploration challenge to pertinent and feasible empirical exploration. The investigator will embrace the experimental exploration design, involving presenting open-ended inquiries to acquire a fresh comprehension of the subject under scrutiny. The design was selected based on what was most suitable to address the subsequent exploration queries:
1. "How will digitalization transform the management accounting profession?"
2. "What competencies will a management accountant require in the future to tackle future digitalization challenges?"
An experimental design is a commendable approach for attaining a new standpoint or illuminating insights on a subject. It will further broaden the understanding of the subject, enabling the researcher to fathom better why and how phenomena occur. The researcher employs exploratory exploration to elucidate concepts, formulate priorities, and generate operational explanations. According to the academic, this realm of exploration is relatively recent after scouring literature on the subject. Consequently, few scholars have probed into these topics. There is exploration on the repercussions of digitalization on accounting enterprises. However, there is a scarcity of information regarding accountants' perceptions about how digitalization would impact their profession. The researcher aspired to comprehend how digitalization has influenced the managing accounting sector. The capacity to convey and procure new information about the subject benefits from employing this form of study. It allows the author to take an open stance to data gathering and analysis.
Data Collection
Researchers can utilize both primary and secondary sources to acquire data. The academic employed primary data in the thesis to procure material pertinent to the exploration challenge. Personal interviews played pivotal roles in information gathering by the investigator. An interview is a commendable method to acquire information and ensure the author garners more insights about the participant's self-awareness, motivation, and personal perspectives on digitalization. The researcher amassed secondary facts from the accounting enterprises' websites to comprehend how digitalization has affected management accounting.
Assortment of enterprises and participants
Interviews with five accounting firms served as the foundation for the exploration. The respondents are equally diverse in terms of experience, age, and gender. They have toiled anywhere from 9 months to 25 years of experience. All firms were free to select who would be interrogated. Interviewing the manager provided an opportunity to scrutinize the company's comprehensive picture. By interviewing a management accountant, the academic acquired firsthand information and vision of how digitization has influenced their profession and their skills to realize organizational objectives. Random sampling strategy played a substantial role in affording each participant equal chances of selection.
Interview method
As previously mentioned, the researcher chiefly amassed data through interviews, which would be a commendable method to accumulate information about digitalization impacts. An interview is a method of acquiring more extensive and comprehensive information about a person's experience, viewpoint, and views about a subject. Interviews provided accurate and consistent data germane to the exploration queries. Interviews comprise semi-structured, organized, and unstructured (in-depth) interviews. The investigator employed semi-structured interviews to focus the conversation in one direction while permitting the subject to express themselves freely and elucidate any uncertainties.
Interview preparations and guide
An interview guide provided a systematic framework for the interviews. An interview guide lists topics and questions that the researcher desires the interviewee to respond to. The researcher was not obligated to adhere strictly to the guide when executing a semi-structured interview; thus, the researcher utilized the guide to aid in recollecting essential subjects and questions. The interview commenced with a brief overview of the issue and ourselves, followed by a series of straightforward questions. These methods would assist the interviewee in commencing well, such as, "What is your employment position?" and "How long have you been in the accounting industry?" were some of the initial questions posed regarding their background and education. "What predicaments and opportunities do you associate with the digitization of the accounting industry?" and "What attributes are needed to leverage digitalization?" were two of the questions raised. These were open-ended questions so that the response might offer supplementary information about the subject.
Interview Completion
Qualitative interviews can be conducted in person, over the phone, via chat, or by email. The researcher contemplated in-person interviews since they nurtured a sense of trust and transparency. This tactic facilitated a seamless dialogue with few disruptions. We also managed to monitor the issue and govern it. The researcher deployed a voice recorder during the interview, to which all participants assented, encompassing both written and oral records. Voice recorders aided the researcher in remaining present throughout the interview to enhance effective communication.
Data Analysis
The researcher employed thematic analysis, which involves compiling, dissecting, recombining, analyzing, and concluding. The investigator utilized codes to denote the themes from the data gathering during a thematic analysis. The academic further employed theme analysis for the thesis as it facilitated a rigorous methodology of depth interview data while also providing a more unobstructed route for study. This tactic supported the research, affording the author to pinpoint central themes, scrutinize critical themes, and notice new challenges that emerged during data collection and assessment that the researcher previously overlooked.
Findings: Digitalization of Management Accounting Role
Management accounting digitalization significantly transforms the profession in diverse ways. For instance, IT solutions, particularly automation, amplify resource availability due to a substantial decrease in the obligatory capacity for repetitive tasks, enabling management accountants to aid with strategic decisions. New business models, a shift in the focus of management accountants, and real-time performance data and reactions are all aspects in support of innovative value-adding operations. Overall, organizations can gain a competitive advantage by effectively managing the data and information made available through digitalization (Puhovichova et al. 140). Due to numerous laws, it is challenging to use all of these benefits. Any significant change to be executed in a firm requires a well-thought-out strategy and overall plan. The development of a performance management approach requires open communication and constructive feedback. Change drivers will struggle to implement changes without strong employee participation. A trial-and-error culture must be established in addition to changing the culture. In an environment where less stability is unavoidable and more uncertainty must be managed, disruptive developments add stress.
Digitalization plays a significant function in enabling workers to experiment with new things, which is critical in dealing with environmental changes but challenging because it contradicts another strategic goal that prioritizes safety through defect avoidance. Consequently, digitalization in the management accounting industry is crucial for keeping personnel up to date on new technologies, such as artificial intelligence and ERP deployments, to eliminate complications and guarantee that work is completed quickly. Before automating anything, it is essential to figure out which actions and responsibilities are appropriate and then rate them. Another issue highlighted is the expensive cost of building sound IT systems. Nonetheless, good
