Social Media Examinerâ€™s (2021) video on social media initiatives was most beneficial to me since it offers more than twenty social media post concepts to enhance the marketing of any business. This source illustrates that social media, specifically Facebook Business and Instagram, possess significant influence and boost marketing efforts, promoting organizations through posts, stories, hashtags, and user-created content. The most valuable information to me was regarding trends, advantages and disadvantages, comparison, direct proposal, and long-form content.

Efficient change leadership is crucial when an organization seeks to embrace social media initiatives. A competent leader is linked with efficient communication, such as written material on social media. For instance, a leader may urge customers to produce content by initiating a hashtag, such as #MyInstagramLogo, and inviting them to share their opinions on the logo or any other product or service the company provides (They Ask, You Answer, 2018). Leaders should elucidate their vision and ensure that everyone comprehends them. They should guide their employees in the correct direction, motivating them to change.

I may face the following moral dilemmas: over-committing, failing to deliver, and exaggerated assertions. I would strive to furnish my customers with sincere information about the business and desist from pleasing everyone to tackle the first issue. Over-promising can leave clients dissatisfied and result in negative feedback. Hence, it is preferable to adhere to ethical standards and make commitments only if they can be completely met. To tackle the second issue, I would aim to be candid and truthful about the content. If the company asserts to transport goods from one country to another in three days, it must fulfill this promise. Otherwise, it would be deceiving the clients, thus compromising its credibility. These strategies will assist me in addressing the aforementioned moral dilemmas because integrity and transparency are always esteemed, and they aid in attracting new customers and retaining the existing customers who have faith in the company.
