Narrative

Most rulers and those aspiring to become one have heard about the significance of leadership traits. Frequently, these skills encompass various abilities linked to communication, emotional intelligence, professionalism, confidence, and ethics. However, not all leaders acknowledge the potent tool of storytelling. Individuals perceive the world from their perspective for the majority of their existence. One viewpoint will never present a complete depiction of ongoing events. When an individual hears the tale of the conversationalist, he senses this distinct viewpoint, constructed on different convictions, on a varied life experience (Snyder et al., 2017). In this instance, if an individual is captivated by history, he is absorbed in a fresh viewpoint and is already reshaping his convictions. In the possession of leaders, such a tool can alter the mindset of their proteges for superior outcomes.
To disrupt the existing prejudice and stereotypes, a leader must undertake more than merely recount a story from his life. Any leader’s account encompasses a conflict, structure that is comprehensible to the conversationalist, and frequently concealed morality that encourages people to undertake the required action. Today we will discuss how storytelling from the mouth of a leader can evolve into one of the primary tools of leadership procedures and why everyone gains from it.
Benefits
Tales are unforgettable, motivating, and naturally convert often arid information. It regularly turns out that storytelling is the lone feasible approach to relay thoughts to individuals. Graphics, printed materials, messages lack the emotional and natural component that an individual invariably embeds in his anecdotes. Initially, the leader displays his humanity by narrating stories that, for many workers, the chief’s apprehension is a stride ahead towards a bond of trust. Secondly, storytelling is ingenuity, and to some extent, even artistry. The identical tale recounted by two individuals can sound wholly distinct. Furthermore, this tool fosters inclusivity and diversification within the team since storytelling is a fundamental occurrence for all nations, societies, and cultures and has existed since time immemorial (Denning, 2017). Thirdly, this tool demonstrates the expertise to prevent errors in the future. Any tale itself emanates from the exterior, and solely through the mouth of an individual, its significance is narrated. A leader can articulate the vision and mission of the enterprise through their stories, thereby engaging employees in work processes more and more. In consolidations and procurements, storytelling for new recruits is crucial, far more critical than salary and schedule (Orr & Bennett, 2017). Ultimately, stories function in circumstances where explicit directives are ineffective (van Hulst, 2017). Individuals cannot become imaginative and adhere to ambiguous regulations until they comprehend what is behind these decisions. A leader’s tale is a highly dependable source in this scenario. Consequently, a mere human life story establishes trust and connections between leaders and employees.
Significance
Alternative tools for constructing trust between supervisors and employees encompass the subsequent. The initial tool is transparent communication and feedback established on justice. Partially, this tool is the opposite side of storytelling in the sense that in the narrative, an individual imparts his emotions and beliefs, and in the instance of feedback, he is willing to acknowledge the sentiments and opinions of another person. The outcome is a comprehensive cycle indispensable for the robust development of the ambiance and effectiveness within any enterprise. The second tool is the introduction of corporate principles and the promotion of gratitude. The tool is constructed on the tenets of corporate ethics and prevailing trends in social responsibility. Employee principles can also be instilled through storytelling, transformational leadership models, or training (van Hulst, 2017). As a result of these endeavors, both the engagement and the contentment of employees in the workplace escalate.
Do you possess a tale?
Allow me to relate a tale to elucidate an unpopular perspective. Leadership attributes and all associated tools can be implemented not solely in institutions and corporations. Sound management is equally crucial in simple daily scenarios and intricate catastrophes beyond the office. Severe complications may emerge in various spheres of human life, where the assured composure of the leader is requisite. One tale recounted by an acquaintance of mine had a profound impact on me and fully reinforced this notion.
My account
I once conversed with an intimate acquaintance of mine who is deeply engrossed in Eastern philosophy and traverses the globe seeking answers to eternal queries. Destiny brought him to Bombay, one of the largest and most resilient cities in India. On the roads, in residences, and in slums, there is consistently some activity vastly distinct from the traffic on the streets, for example, in New York. He had the privilege to partake in slum life with the native inhabitants, and leading this territorial community, as it is presumed, was a leader. Each day, if he was not engrossed in affairs, he frequented the slums and recounted stories to his residents, laughing heartily and imparting wisdom. However, his methods of governance appeared peculiar to my acquaintance, and his reprimands raised numerous queries. For instance, he once quarreled with siblings; he securely fastened leg to leg with a scarf until the day’s end, reminding them that they are relatives to each other and no disputes can sever their bond, which he so metaphorically conveyed. The leader was perpetually accompanied by an unwavering assurance in his own actions. My acquaintance was skeptical about such methods until a fire besieged the slums. The fire obliterated several makeshift dwellings, rendering people homeless. Nevertheless, the leader issued sharp, coherent, and accurate instructions, with the aid of which the residents managed the catastrophe. Considering how arduous it is to access water in the slums and no matter how pitiful the attempts to extinguish the immense flames ceaselessly being hurled into the neighboring slums, with the aid of a natural leader and the engagement of residents in the process, the predicament was resolved.
Conclusion
We may not comprehend what underlies the leader’s actions, question his righteousness, and be astonished at his confidence. Every leader’s deed is accompanied by faith; otherwise, he cannot anticipate the same reciprocation and engagement. Not everyone is permitted to evaluate a manager on dire predicaments, although there are doubtlessly such “fires” in the operations of every enterprise, with the distinction that there is no issue of life and death. The enlightening “punishment” of the two brothers is intrinsically compassionate and metaphorical; the siblings consented to abide by his regulations and likely forgot about the dispute by evening. By recounting stories, this Indian leader acknowledged each of his inhabitants as an individual and divulged himself to him as a person. Hence, in the event of a problematic situation, no one deserted the settlement in distress, and beyond this, there is much more than apprehension for their own possessions.
