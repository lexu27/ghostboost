One of the societal aspects that could influence which groceries are bought is the absence of nutritious food. Dealing with Wal-Mart in Forest Part enables me to collect sufficient details concerning accessible products and their costs. For instance, one gallon of excellent value milk is $2.65, one loaf of Sara Lee bread is $2.44, one sack of gala apples is $3.58, and one sack of organic baby carrots is $3.88. Proceeding with my trip, the costs are as follows: one yogurt tub is $1.92, 2-liter of Pepsi Soda is $1.98, one sack of chips is $2.84, and one family-size bundle of cookies is $3.98. In Maywood, IL 60153, the community is primarily African Americans (68.6%), but Caucasian citizens (18.2%) and Hispanic/Latino (26.9%) also reside there (United States Census Bureau, n.d.). The chosen residential zone lacks decent grocery stores, but the number of fast-food eateries has significantly risen during the past few years. This indicates that individuals are unable to purchase nutritious food but must consume low-quality items, contributing to their health issues such as high blood pressure and diabetes.
Another societal element that impacts human health and shopping behaviors is inadequate alteration and the impossibility for the laboring class to visit Wal-Mart regularly. The median household earnings in the selected area is about $50,176, and the poverty rate is approximately 15% (United States Census Bureau, n.d.). This implies that not all persons can visit the shops with quality food and make choices, not at the expense of their health. The amalgamation of transportation, low earnings, and food elements are crucial for public health (Islam, 2019). It is insufficient to recognize an issue but to discover methods to resolve it and aid the population in attaining enhancements.
A group health nurse (CHN) is accountable for enhancing public health and the selection of measures to deal with food safety. According to Schffer and Strohschein (2019), there are 17 measures presented in five groups with varying shades, and cooperation is an exclusive opportunity for all community members to promote and safeguard health. The principal features of this measure are a substantial commitment level, partnership, and aim orientation (Schffer & Strohschein, 2019). Cooperation at systems levels assists CHNs to contact all appropriate stakeholders, community collaboration is essential to scrutinize the present state of affairs, and partnership with families enhances individual knowledge and involvement.
