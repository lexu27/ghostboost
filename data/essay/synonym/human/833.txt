Athens and Sparta were two crucial city-states of the Archaic Period of Greece; they were inherently alike but different in numerous ways. They both shared representative forms of government through assemblies of members elected by the citizens of each respective city-state, but Sparta was governed by two monarchs in a tightly controlled military state, while Athens was governed by archons chosen annually in a democracy. Both city-states shared an extensive slave-owning culture, with Spartans enslaving the helots while Athens possessed significant populations of slaves. It could be contended that both Sparta and Athens were militaristic. Sparta epitomized military culture, training males from a young age to fight and be self-reliant. However, Athens also upheld a potent army and formidable navy as well; it was a peaceful city-state, frequently waging war to establish dominance (Brooks, 2019).
Where the two city-states differed significantly is in their cultures. Sparta was a military society concentrated on service to the military and state. It stressed aspects such as responsibility, control, and physical stamina through all components of its government system, like the military, education, and civil service. In numerous ways, Athens also appreciated these aspects, particularly with an emphasis on civil service, especially after reforms that permitted not only wealthy nobles to govern but granted all males access to authority. However, the Athens culture was also deeply rooted in humanities, such as philosophies, art, and entertainment â€“ things that Sparta had little regard for in its society. Athens also maintained a robust class division, where the ruling elite controlled much of the authority and riches while the lower classes, despite being citizens, were granted less. Women who had virtually no authority, voice, or presence in Athens society were not allowed to own property or vote and were viewed as the possessions of their husbands and fathers. Meanwhile, while some class division existed in Sparta, the military nature united everyone as both monarchs and ordinary Spartans respected each other. Women in Sparta were granted the most privileges, possibly in the entire ancient world, being able to own property, could speak publicly, manage households, and be trusted by their husbands (Brooks, 2019).
