Environmentally conscious technologies evolve with the increasing societal awareness regarding the problems induced by pesticide use in diverse sectors. Sharma et al. (2020) assert that "these substances infiltrate the ecosystem, thus disrupting the delicate environmental balance through bio-accumulation" (p. 110812). As a result, alternative approaches are sought after to safeguard plants and wildlife from bioaccumulation and significant alterations in natural environments (Sharma et al., 2020). Biological, semi-chemical, and physical management techniques to reduce pesticide usage necessitate adequate support to achieve sustainable enhancements in the ecological condition. Undoubtedly, governmental initiatives, legislative reforms, and corporate endeavors that advocate for environmental conservation are essential for the implementation of innovations.

Various methods exist to influence the decision-making procedures concerning pesticide use in sectors like agriculture and animal husbandry. Initially, awareness about the harmful impact on human health must be heightened through public health campaigns or communal gatherings. Understanding the illnesses that individuals exposed to pesticides could develop within their households would prompt them to assume accountability more effectively than merely warning them about the repercussions that may transpire in the future (Magarey et al., 2019). Secondly, lawmakers and authorities can establish a supportive scheme for enterprises transitioning towards reducing pesticide usage (Sharma et al., 2020).

In fact, special taxation schemes, benefits, or incentivizing assurances can motivate farmers to adopt alternative management practices to eradicate the utilization of neonicotinoid insecticides. Finally, a set of environmentally efficient criteria to assess the degree of risk stemming from a specific industry or company's pesticide application should be devised. Magarey et al. (2019) affirm that "eco-effectiveness serves as a practical foundation for optimizing pest control for sustainability" (p. 3129). The existence of regulations and benchmarks aligning with production standards can prompt industries to explore eco-friendly manufacturing methods.
