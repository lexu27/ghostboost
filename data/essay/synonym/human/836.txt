Preamble
Importantly, healthcare security and well-being are fundamental concerns in attaining a quality healthy population. The intricacy of patient technology has been evolving. Previously, nurses used to physically interact, sense, and listen about monitoring patients while tending to them. With the current progression of technology, various approaches have been devised to enhance and upgrade healthcare services which have been highly successful (Alotaibi and Federico, 2017). While technological changes elucidate both challenges and solutions in improving patient safety, much effort is required to address the issues. One of the developed technological tactics involves Automated IV Pumps, a tool utilized to dispense medication. The introduction of Automated IV Pumps has resulted in both adverse and favorable impacts in the nursing field based on the description.
The importance of providing quality healthcare is the extent to which health services to populations heighten the likelihood of achieving desired healthcare results. Automated IV Pumps are one of the primary technological innovations in healthcare which is a device engineered to assist nurses in administering the correct dosage. Employing Automated IV Pumps has boosted the effectiveness of service provision, minimized mistakes and enhanced flexibility, which is believed to enhance overall patient safety. To a significant degree, safety precautions such as adhering to instructions, supervision, and dosage must be taken into account.
The issue at hand
Despite the technological advancements in healthcare, achieving 100% patient safety remains a challenge. The escalating number of patient concerns necessitates more focus to conduct further research (Wei et al.,2021). Patient safety and care are major priorities for all, thus the research will assess the patient outcomes associated with the use of Automated IV Pumps to devise the requisite measures. Alternatively, there has been marginal progress in care services in the nursing sector.
Regardless of the advancements in technology that have enhanced the level of patient care, there are still concerns about patient safety regarding the utilization of technological advancements, such as Automated IV Pumps. Patient problems, such as medical errors, are among the primary hurdles that need to be minimized to ensure safety and well-being.
Aims of the study
The primary objective of the study will examine the major impacts of Automated IV Pumps in the nursing sector. Furthermore, the study will accomplish this by evaluating the results of patients undergoing treatments using Automated IV Pumps.
Inquiry
To assess the effects of Automated IV Pumps in the nursing sector.
Rationale for the study
My study aims to ascertain both positive and negative consequences of Automated IV Pumps on patient care and safety to provide the essential backing for the use of Automated IV Pumps in the nursing sector or otherwise.
Discoveries
Nurses engage in numerous tasks to deliver quality patient care. The advancement of technology such as the use of Automated IV Pumps is a significant achievement as it enhances the precise assessment of drug administration. Patient care should no longer rely on guesswork but on accuracy and consistency. Conversely, the use of Automated IV Pumps eases the burden on overworked nurses. The impact of Automated IV Pumps is evident in the reduced occurrences of medical errors, simplified infusion capabilities, and user-friendly operation.
Diminution of errors
Incorrect dosage and medication to the human body can be perilous. Nursing medication administration errors have been curtailed since they provide the correct dosage accurately. The use of pumps provides a reliable method to dispense medications, creating a safer environment for patients. Furthermore, it streamlines the work environment for nursing professionals who have to administer medications using IVs.
Infusion capabilities
An infusion pump system is not a fixed piece of equipment, it can be tailored to various conditions. Having anything too large to move might waste time and energy. It has a simplified process of infusion that can save a patientâ€™s life if triaging them in an unfavorable place. Also, hospitals frequently deal with crises, an infusion system that can be moved across the building is beneficial. A smart infusion system allows to use it in non-traditional settings, therefore, to serve more patients.
Straightforward user interface
Using an infusion pump does not necessitate a technician. A person does not even need to know how to program it. It is simple and easy to read, which helps when providing IVs quickly. These IV pumps are excellent choices for nearly any medical facility because of their accuracy and ease of utilization.
Benefits of Automated IV Pumps
Conversely, Automated IV Pumps have fewer medical errors and incorporate alerts to reduce the error rate. Additionally, they are versatile and convenient for nurses as they can be easily transported and utilized during emergencies. Above all, Automated IV Pumps simplify the treatment process as nurses have ample time to attend to patients, thus enhancing patient safety and treatment for quality recovery.
Drawbacks of Automated IV Pumps
Despite the positive impacts of Automated IV Pumps in the nursing sector, there are also negative consequences linked to their utilization. Automated IV Pumps are costly to procure, thereby restricting other healthcare organizations and nurses in delivering safe care. Furthermore, the programmed language of Automated IV Pumps may contain errors which could lead to severe health effects for patients, resulting in diminished patient care and safety.
In conclusion
With the reduced medication errors and the flexibility of Automated IV Pumps, Nurses have recently made significant strides in care and patient safety. Conversely, the positive effects of using Automated IV Pumps outweigh the negative impacts of their use. I would, therefore, propose the continued use of Automated IV Pumps in drug administration and medications. Additionally, there are improvement measures to surpass the negative impacts of using Automated IV Pumps.
