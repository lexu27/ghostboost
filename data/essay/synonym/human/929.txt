Creationism is a religious doctrine concerning the inception of the world based on the Bible. This motion is frequently portrayed as a branch of science, and writings are portrayed as scientific and peer-reviewed. Nonetheless, creationism does not fulfill the requirements of the scientific method of knowledge – deriving conclusions from facts rather than faith. A scientist can only speculate about some new entity if there is substantial justification to do so that cannot be elucidated by the existing theory and not because of religious faith. Nonetheless, creationists are not perturbed by their absence of a scientific method. In this manuscript, I would like to evaluate one such document. Despite having its proportion of factual information, the majority of its arguments do not endure criticism. The document “The image of God” by Genesis File endeavors to invalidate Darwin’s theory of evolution and substantiate that life on earth was shaped by external intelligence (2021). The author’s primary contentions against evolution are the proliferation of molecular disorder and the insufficiency of transitional forms in the archives of fossils, which ostensibly contradict Darwin’s theory of evolution. In my document, I will inspect these arguments consecutively and emphasize their principal point. Subsequently, I will utilize evidence-based science to disprove these assertions. In conclusion, I will summarize all the deficiencies in the evidence and make recommendations on how to enhance them. The initial imperfection in the document’s argument is that throughout the entire existence of the species homo sapiens, not a single mutation into other species has been observed. This argument cannot be deemed valid because it manipulates the facts. The reality is that this argument is cited as evidence that an organism cannot alter its form and evolve into other species autonomously. It argues in favor of the fact that early organisms could not evolve from natives into amphibians and then into mammalian creatures (Genesis File, 2021). However, the author of the document does not contemplate that at the time of life of the first organisms, the conditions on our planet were dramatically distinct from those of today. Floods, droughts, and ice ages transpired. To endure, organisms had to undergo substantial changes. Nor should we disregard that these changes transpired over millions of years. Nonetheless, the author of the document contends that since none of them evolved further over the last few hundred thousand years of modern homo sapiens existence, the entire theory of evolution is flawed (Genesis File, 2021). Alterations in the species transpired and are still transpiring, just very gradually. For instance, primitive humans had a dissimilar physique; they possessed a more potent, broader, and shorter chest than modern humans (Jantsch, 2019). These alterations were due to the optimization of the respiratory system, which granted humans the capability to run long distances and other types of endurance. Another argument to invalidate the document argues that our species has been around for a relatively brief period compared to those that have undergone more remarkable evolution. This signifies that we may not yet have attained a notable change due to lack of time and may indeed be transformed into another form in the process of unceasing evolution. The subsequent imperfection in the document’s argument is that primitive organisms could never have evolved into humans. The paper justifies this by stating that a cell encloses a specific genetic code and can only be subject to minor adaptive changes (Genesis File, 2021). Thus, the author contends that a unicellular organism cannot evolve into a multicellular organism. Additionally, a unicellular organism cannot develop into a multicellular organism independently. According to the author, for more striking evolution, the intervention of an intelligent being is necessary. The instance of human birth can refute this argument. Man, a complex multicellular organism with consciousness, is born from the fusion of two unicellular organisms, the male sperm and the female testicle (Jantsch, 2019). This is an incontrovertible experimental fact. As one can observe, the process of human birth from unicellular microorganisms exists in nature and in no way necessitates divine intervention. Consequently, a multicellular organism can emerge from a single-celled organism. Furthermore, when a new human being is born, evolution replicates the entire path from unicellulars to humans. Development is fundamentally chemically identical to the birth of a human being; the process is just significantly prolonged in time. This is precisely how it occurred – from unicellular emerged multicellular. Another instance can also illustrate this. Speciation due to acts of natural selection transpires today in a wholly natural manner without the slightest divine intervention. Occasionally even in spite of human intervention – for example, numerous species of pathogenic bacteria are routinely poisoned with antibiotics. Many bacteria perish, but new antibiotic-resistant bacteria emerge due to the pressure of natural selection, and not even hundreds of years have elapsed. Another imperfection in the document’s argument is the reference to the absence of transitional forms in the archives of the fossil record as a fact in support of the absence of evolution. Creationists believe that development has always progressed simultaneously and assumed many transitional forms must have been (Genesis File, 2021). If there were no transitional forms, there was no evolution. To invalidate this argument, it is worth emphasizing how evolution transpired. The evolutionary transition from one species to another transpires only when natural selection is under pressure. The factor inducing the stress of natural selection is not constant, so evolutionary transitions are also discontinuous (Jantsch, 2019). As an example, contemplate the transition between fish and amphibians. As long as fish resided in the water and had sufficient food to survive there, there was no pressure of natural selection to bring them onto land in search of food. Nevertheless, this selection pressure emerged from the depletion of food and heightened competition in the water on the one hand and the abundance of food and lack of competition on land on the other (Dror, 2020). Those fish with slightly larger fins could occasionally feed near the ground and lay eggs there. Consequently, after one generation, the descendants of this population in these conditions had slightly longer fins. In the next generation, there were even longer fins. Hence, every year in the coastal fish population, fish with larger and larger fins survive and reproduce. After another few hundred years, they developed some semblance of paws. As a result, it turns out that the evolutionary transition is very fast by geological standards – only a few generations, not millions of years. Consequently, evolution transpired by such rapid leaps caused by the variable pressure of natural selection, which varied depending on natural conditions – differences in resources and the level of competition in flora and fauna. This elucidates the scarcity of transitional forms in the fossil record. In conclusion, while many creationist articles are deemed scientific, they encompass many imperfections in their reasoning. The primary shortcomings were manipulating facts, disregarding a critical treatment of arguments, and the lack of a theoretical basis. Therefore, the author erroneously contended that the species homo sapiens is incapable of evolution and that a single-celled organism cannot transform into a multicellular organism independently. To enhance the argument, I recommend the author to peruse scientific articles presenting an alternative view. This will aid in making the ideas more comprehensive and aligning with current scientific evidence.
