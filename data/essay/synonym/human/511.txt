I am able to express that I would arrange my genome for various reasons. Firstly, despite the fact that it has a negative implication, this data can lead to uneasiness and pressure, but simultaneously, I can utilize valuable time to prevent a severe sickness. Secondly, any genome sequencing outcomes are crucial from a scientific perspective since they have the chance to either validate the statistics of the majority of identical sequences or uncover a new statistical anomaly that holds beneficial scientific information for society. Finally, this data would be beneficial for future generations, even within my family, to prevent similar issues in children and grandchildren. Certainly, in this scenario, the financial accessibility of this tool is crucial, and, in my view, sooner or later, it should be accessible to most people on Earth. However, such access should be granted only after thorough research into the psychological nature of the perception of the outcomes and the mitigation of potential harm to the participantsâ€™ health.

My focus was caught by scientific data that the arrangement of the genome includes predispositions to specific diseases and that this data can be acquired not only in qualitative but also in quantitative form. Surprisingly, 99.9% of individuals have roughly identical sequences of T, C, G, and A proteins; nevertheless, they harbor specific diseases (Sanderson, 2018). The distinctiveness of the series results in a broad range of disorders in the body, including mental disorders (Sanderson, 2018). The significance of the psychological aspect in providing this data to sequencing participants may offer valuable insights for further research exploring the connection between mental health disorders and genome structure (Robinson et al., 2019). Various diseases with detectable symptoms but unable to provide a comprehensive picture among recognized diseases can be explored using sequencing (Robinson et al., 2019). Ultimately, through genome sequencing, individuals contribute to a fundamental comprehension of certain aspects of disease causes, which can stimulate advancements not only in medicine within each specific domain but also in pharmacology, psychology, and other affiliated sciences.

I strive to visit my physicians annually to sustain and prevent health. I visit the gym to maintain fitness. I encounter some spinal issues and encountered a severe heart condition as a child, which was treated by adolescence. In my perspective, the timing of this process is crucial because by concentrating on heart disease in childhood, my parents could discern a predisposition to a condition of a different character with less focus. We must strike a balance between conscious maturity, prudent choices, and youth when the outcomes of sequencing can aid in preventing any disease.

This data can be harnessed to enhance society in the subsequent manner. First, the nature of most severe diseases will be identified individually for each individual for the objective of prevention and treatment. Secondly, unknown conditions with particular symptoms can be clarified through genomics. Finally, methods for dealing with individuals who have anomalies, including psychological ones, can be obtained in the future. The adverse influence can manifest itself in the still inadequately understood psychological facet of providing information: in specific cases, it can injure a person (Sanderson, 2018). Furthermore, it is challenging to exert further oversight over the activities of an individual who may maintain their life unchanged or disregard low risks of diseases (Sanderson, 2018). Ultimately, by enhancing the accessibility of this tool, it will still be rather difficult to screen all individuals on the planet, leading to injustice and social conflicts.
