The cause for the military conflict between the United States and Spain was the American government’s backing of the Cubans’ protracted struggle for autonomy from the Spanish monarchy. The US incursion into Cuba became apparent when the USS “Maine” sank under enigmatic circumstances in the waters of Havana. Approximately at the same period, in February 1898, hurried preparations for war commenced, while the Spaniards were charged in absentia of sabotaging the battleship (Mortenson & Springer, 2019). Broadly speaking, one can discuss a prolonged political maneuver with Spain, in which various provocations strained relations with the nation on the brink of the conflict.
The emancipation of Cuba appeared to be a financially alluring opportunity for the US and offered strategic benefits. Furthermore, the American dominion was then just gaining momentum and already had a successful background in seizing other territories of the Western Hemisphere (Kagan, 2019). The American government depicted the unleashed war as a struggle for the concerns of Cuba and depended on instances of human rights violations to justify military intervention.
In April, a ten-week conflict commenced in which the United States overcame the Spanish military and naval forces. Under the Treaty of Paris in 1898, the United States acquired command of the island. In 1899, the island was taken over, and a couple of years later, the government obtained authorization to establish naval bases. The stance of the American government is technically legitimate, but essentially, it seems to be a more humane type of control of the island. By utilizing instances of the subjugation of the Cuban populace, the United States secured the backing of the insurgent movement. It gained the ethical entitlement to seize the territory for its objectives.
