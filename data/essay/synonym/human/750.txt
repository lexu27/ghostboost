Walmart is a global corporation that has catered to clients in global markets for a long duration. The enterprise has established above 15,000 retail stores worldwide (Courtemanche et al., 2019). Nonetheless, as the corporation's retail store quantity has expanded, it has encountered challenges that have hindered its customer experience. The primary issue is that the corporation was unable to offer any aid or incentive for exceptional performance by the employees in their daily work routines. Businesses that overlook compensating their staff often encounter a decline in productivity due to the employees' reduced work contentment. Therefore, job contentment was low in the absence of support from the company's overall management.

Given the aforementioned problem, the optimal solution is for the corporation to reward its employees for any improvements acknowledged at the workplace. This will help in boosting the team's productivity. The company should also take into account the staff's interests, such as their aspirations, principles, and worries about their occupations. The corporation should consider the advantages and strive to enhance them to motivate people to operate at their maximum potential. Nevertheless, it should be noted that most enterprises operate most effectively when their personnel are driven by positive thoughts and attitudes.
