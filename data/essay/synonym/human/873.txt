Chapter I
The initial chapter delineates the status of women in Neo-Confucian reigns in China and Japan. When contrasting the outlook of the community towards women in these two nations, it is evident that Chinese society was more stringent towards them (Hughes, S.S. & Hughes, B., 1997). Nevertheless, women’s status in both societies was fairly low as China and Japan were male-dominated patriarchal nations, although Japan formerly operated under a matrifocal system.
The Chinese authorities enacted various statutes designed to safeguard women’s honor and virtue, yet in reality, these laws acted as stringent constraints on their liberty and encroachment on their entitlements. Therefore, the Quing ravishment regulations introduced in the midst of the XVII century made it arduous for women to attain justice as they were required to furnish proof of being violated. Furthermore, the description of ravishment was officially defined, making it challenging to categorize an attack as rape if it did not align with the stipulated criteria (Hughes, S. S. & Hughes, B., 1997). Additionally, the Chinese government curtailed the position of widows as they were compelled either to reside in the residence of their deceased spouse and tend to the household or to wed again, relinquishing all possessions and offspring to the initial husband's family. Consequently, numerous widows were coerced into remarriage against their wishes and left bereft of assets and standing.
Consequently, women in China were compelled to safeguard their virtue independently, occasionally even at the expense of their lives. Despite their marginalized legal standing and almost negligible social stature, some Chinese women were prodigious artists. For instance, Chen Shu is among the renowned artists of that era, and her creations were esteemed by the monarch himself. Women in Japan were nurtured with more autonomy than in China, although they were still anticipated to comply with men. They commenced working at twelve years old or even earlier and subsequent to marriage, they were anticipated not only to manage the household but also to labor alongside their spouse (Hughes, S.S. & Hughes, B., 1997). Conversely, affluent peasants could afford to educate their daughters to serve as attendants in the residences of the aristocracy.
Chapter II
The subsequent chapter of the manuscript is centered on the status of women in the Ottoman Empire in the XVII century. To commence, men were legally permitted to wed more than one woman, and numerous aristocrats, including the sovereign, maintained seraglios where their concubines resided (Hughes, S. S. & Hughes, B., 1997). Therefore, during Suleman I's rule, one of his former concubines, Hurrem, emerged as one of the most influential women in the Empire and influenced the country's politics. Despite the array of privileges afforded to them, such as receiving education and the prospect of marrying a nobleman, all women in the ruler's seraglio, except his mother and siblings, were enslaved. Despite their enslaved status, the sultan's favored concubines could establish social connections with the nobility and garner their backing or even companionship.
Furthermore, hereditary unions were quite prevalent in the Ottoman Empire during the XVII century. It is noteworthy that Turkish princesses could undergo multiple nuptials throughout their lives as their initial marriage typically transpired when they were approximately two or three years old (Hughes, S. S. & Hughes, B., 1997). This practice aided the dynasty in augmenting its political clout and influence not only internally but externally as well.
Regarding women who did not reside in seraglios, it is imperative to note that they had the option to resort to the judiciary to safeguard their entitlements or resolve issues pertaining to property, matrimony, divorce, and other matters. Historical accounts from that period reveal that Turkish women litigated in court almost as frequently as men did (Hughes, S. S. & Hughes, B., 1997). Despite the provision for a woman to annul her marital union, she was mandated to obey her spouse during their matrimony. Although men could have multiple wives and several concubines, women had the liberty to select their spouses, and coerced marriage was nearly unattainable.
