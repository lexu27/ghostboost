Both Christianity and postmodern relativism pertain to spirituality and its impact on human life. Christianity advocates the belief in a supreme God who governs everything in the cosmos, permitting and prohibiting life occurrences. The theological and religious perspective influences how individuals perceive God as the omnipotent and everlasting one (Lasair, 2020). Christians’ belief systems are rooted in the idea of God as depicted in the Sacred Scriptures. They elucidate the purpose, veracity, and significance of human life, shaping how Christians view healthcare. Reliance on the almighty external power enables Christians to attain a transcendent state for healthcare encounters and other life incidents.
As they adhere to God’s direction in every choice, Christians are more content with life outcomes. For instance, they embrace healthcare results more readily than non-believers do due to the conviction that God permits every destiny, whether favorable or unfavorable. Morals are guided by biblical principles, even in relation to healthcare (Lasair, 2020). For instance, termination of pregnancy is equated with killing the unborn child and is not sanctioned by Christians. Consequently, healthcare determinations concerning Christianity are directed by the scriptures.
In contrast to Christianity, which rebuffs uncertainty by conforming to biblical directives, postmodern relativism assumes a permissive stance towards spirituality and morals. These relativists consider that there is no absolute truth concerning God's existence or adherence to morals (Garrett, 2018). Hence, every spiritual or moral conviction holds merit, even when conflicting. Therefore, discarding any discourse or decision regarding healthcare is not advocated. Postmodern relativism endorses diversity and multicultural methodologies in healthcare because healthcare practitioners must embrace varied and contradictory viewpoints from patients and families (Garrett, 2018). Moreover, the comprehension of ethics may vary from one patient to another without compromising the quality of care.
Scientism
Scientism contends that physical sciences furnish superior scientific knowledge as the sole fount of genuine and definitive truths. The physical sciences, encompassing physics and biology, rely on laws of nature or experimentation. They yield dependable outcomes grounded on testable, factual, and reproducible data. Scientism views social sciences as inferior or pseudosciences since their theories and suppositions are not replicable or factual but subject to alteration (Vukov, 2021). It seeks to distinguish between the two science categories based on the worth of their information, with physical sciences presenting more valuable knowledge than social sciences. The dependence on subjectivity renders social sciences susceptible to influences by human nature, leading to conflicting notions on the same principles. Overall, scientism accords greater intellectual authority to physical over social sciences in matters of knowledge.
Several contentions are raised against scientism and its elevation of physical sciences. The first contention disputes the assertion that physical sciences employ factual data that remains constant by affirming the recalibration of measuring instruments and variations in the environment (Vukov, 2021). Hence, the sciences cannot offer absolute facts and truths as knowledge expands with new information, blurring the distinction between physical and social sciences. The second argument against scientism pertains to the disregard physical sciences exhibit towards personal viewpoints to heavily rely on rationality. Given that deliberate thoughts play a vital role in new knowledge discovery, the authoritarian approach advocated by scientism impedes scientific progress. Accordingly, social sciences are better positioned to advance scientific knowledge through the exploration of new information as they support deliberate thoughts.
Worldview Questions
Ultimate Reality
Ultimate reality posits that individuals are shaped by the interactions they have with the surroundings. People are a product of their environment through nurturing rather than nature. The surroundings encompass family units, schools, religious factions, community, neighborhood, city, and state. From this perspective, I am the product of my engagements with parents, grandparents, and siblings at the family level. Other significant interactions occur in my educational institution, where I engage with peers and educators. I engage socially beyond home and educational establishments in workplaces and other communal activities.
My family has instilled fundamental values and beliefs in me, while schools, community, and religious groups have supplemented the belief system or altered my outlook on certain concepts. Growing up in a Christian household, most of my formative years were spent in Christian environments rather than Islamic ones. Consequently, I lean more towards conservatism in contentious public health matters such as abortion and polygamy. Nevertheless, the academic milieu and knowledge gained through learning have broadened my perspective to become a more progressive Christian. Thus, I would endorse abortion in cases of life-threatening situations and support LGBTQ communities in the spirit of equal human rights.
Nature of the Universe
The nature of the cosmos entails perpetual change by relying on energy and prioritizing processes through evolution, energy conversion, extinction, and competition. Evolution involves adapting to alterations in one's environment, while energy conversion signifies a transition between energy forms. Extinction transpires when components are eliminated from the universe due to the inability to compete, whereas competition denotes the contest for scarce resources.
While flora and fauna are susceptible to extinction, humans undergo competition and evolution. The nature of the universe compels us to pursue education in schools to become competitive in the job market. Without skills and experience, individuals risk becoming 'extinct' in their areas of specialization. As technology progresses, humans must evolve to acclimate to the latest ways of living to avert extinction. For instance, the world is progressively transitioning to digital currencies like those offered by central banks. Individuals clinging to cash transactions will eventually be unable to make purchases at most stores in a few years. The nature of the universe necessitates their transition from cash to cashless payment systems for survival.
Human Being
Human beings are sentient creatures and can be characterized as the creations of God or products of evolution. Religion acknowledges God as the architect of the entire universe, including human beings. For example, Christians uphold the belief that individuals bear the likeness of God as detailed in the creation narrative of the Sacred Scriptures. Hence, they are expected to fulfill the creator's purpose for their existence, encompassing procreation, stewardship of the earth and its inhabitants, and obedience to divine directives. Humans are also viewed as products of science through the evolutionary process. This perspective posits that humans developed advanced cognitive abilities through selective adaptation, resulting in intricate vocabularies, languages, and technologies.
My worldview aligns with the Christian definition that an almighty God fashioned humans in his image to fulfill his design on earth. In this context, we are enjoined to adhere to the creator's principles by procreating and safeguarding the rest of creation. Humans are custodians on earth, designated by God to care for animals, birds, and the environment they inhabit.
Knowledge
Knowledge comprises a blend of abilities, information, and facts cognitively acquired through learning or experience. Learning may transpire in formal or informal settings such as educational institutions or at home. In a formal educational setting, the processes of knowledge acquisition are organized with distinct roles between educators and learners. Moreover, specific bodies of knowledge are imparted to learners. Conversely, informal learning environments often entail social circles where knowledge is inadvertently transmitted from one individual to another. For instance, within a familial context, children learn from their parents through emulation of behavior and language. Experience denotes acquiring knowledge through practical engagement rather than from an external source. Thus, learning imparts theoretical knowledge while experience imparts practical expertise.
Knowledge plays a pivotal role in enhancing the quality of life for
