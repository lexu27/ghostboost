The piece by Zulaika (2022) illustrates the influence of COVID-19 lockdowns on adolescent pregnancy and school abandonment among secondary school girls in Kenya. The instances of teenage pregnancy emerged in Kenya following the nationwide school shutdown that commenced in March 2020 and extended until January 2021. Zulaika (2022) explores the degree to which the pandemic impacted the sexual and reproductive health of adolescents in Rarieda subcounty. The research demonstrates there was a restricted engagement of health authorities regarding the issue of pregnancy among school girls. Adolescents lack sexual instruction and are not informed about various protection techniques. Health authorities should prioritize this matter as early pregnancy can jeopardize girls' well-being and result in diverse socio-economic challenges in the future. Furthermore, if the frequency of adolescent pregnancy continues to rise, there will be fewer educated females in Kenya. Zulaika (2022) also notes that the stress level of pregnant teenagers is substantial, influencing the mental and physical health of young prospective mothers. To address this concern, Zulaika (2022) proposes implementing population-level measures concerning girls who are attending school. Pupils should receive instruction on the fundamentals of sexual education and the consequences of sexual activity. Additionally, the article emphasizes that contagious illnesses can spread rapidly if school girls are unaware of the significance of contraceptives. Thus, there is a necessity for a national initiative to educate school students and their parents about sexual and reproductive matters. The repercussions of COVID-19 on teenage pregnancy are adverse, leading to supplementary social and economic challenges not only for the expectant girls and their families but also for the entire nation.
