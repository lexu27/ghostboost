The well-being of the population is one of the principles for the community, thus, safeguarding and enhancing it is a crucial responsibility in which everyone, regardless, should participate. Alterations in the circumstances for the operation of governmental bodies and the ongoing shift to market connections propose novel approaches to arranging and methodological backing for the education, retraining, and advanced education of nursing experts. Nursing staff, executing the nursing procedure in offering obstetric and gynecological assistance, offer medical and preventive assistance to women and families at different stages of their lives, conduct observation, examination, rehabilitation, provide care and required aid.
For women, the resolution to end a pregnancy may be influenced by various factors. Termination of a pregnancy is the deliberate or unintended cessation of a pregnancy (Endler et al., 2019). In certain nations, abortions are officially permitted, while others are restricted to the degree of inadmissibility of targeted aid from medical staff. Moreover, diverse religions contrast in their stance toward abortion. Hence, women who contemplate and determine to have an abortion may encounter a different life circumstance, as well as the conditions for terminating the pregnancy.
A nurse serves as a consultant, guide, helper regarding a woman and her family. Nursing personnel must complete all phases of the nursing procedure: conduct an initial evaluation, recognize the patient’s issues, plan the tasks, execute planned care, draw deductions from the care. Additionally, an essential aspect of the work of nursing staff is medical ethics. A nurse devotes much more time with patients than the medical personnel (Mainey et al., 2020). The capacity to adhere to medical ethics, to maintain medical confidentiality and the patient's confidentiality, not to reveal them is the responsibility of every healthcare worker. Consequently, a compassionate and diligent attitude toward patients assumes a very important part in the execution of their responsibilities.
Simultaneously, the nursing staff strictly and meticulously obeys all the criteria of this medical facility and the guidelines of the attending physician. Presently, due to the expansion of knowledge in the realm of physiology and pathophysiology of the processes linked with planning pregnancy, childbirth, and the postpartum period, contemporary techniques of obstetric care, prevention, and treatment of pregnancy and childbirth issues are being devised. Nevertheless, even when in disagreement with the patient’s resolution to have an abortion, if the patient possesses such a legal entitlement, the nurse must honor this perspective.
The nursing employee, attentively monitoring the patient, should promptly inform the physician about all alterations in the patient’s status. Furthermore, the duty of the nurse may be to educate the patient about the abortion procedure and its potential repercussions (Mainey et al., 2020). In this instance, the function of the nurse is to communicate the information entirely and impartially, without personal bias. Similarly, advice should be dispensed based on the patient's well-being and not the nurse's personal stance on the matter of abortion. At the instant of presenting such information, the interpersonal skills of a nurse are significant to merge the function of psychological and medical care.
To conclude, there is consistently a necessity for high proficiency of medical practitioners, encompassing the nurses. A nurse must possess an understanding of medical ethics and adhere to it when interacting with patients. Medical staff must respect the resolution and rights of a woman who chooses to have an abortion. Accordingly, when informing the patient about the potential repercussions, compliance, unbiased storytelling, and the elimination of the personal viewpoint of the nurse must be adhered to. Likewise, the protocol of safeguarding patient information confidentiality must be maintained.
