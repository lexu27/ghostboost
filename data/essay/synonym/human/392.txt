Synopsis
Tufts-New England Medical Center (Tufts-NEMC) situated in Boston, MA, is among the most established enduring medical establishments in the region. Nonetheless, it is a respected healthcare organization recognized as a comprehensive medical and surgical facility highly rated for excelling in computer technology and education globally. Due to the eminence and well-regarded healthcare operations, the medical center obtained $2.3 billion in research grant money from the National Institute of Health. The $2.3 billion grant was the most substantial grant sum awarded to any medical facility in that area, ranking second only to California. Hence, it was an honor to secure that level of funding. Regrettably, in the 1970s and the 1980s, Massachusetts hospitals, along with other medical facilities in the country, amassed a significant amount of debt to modernize the facilities and acquire new technological equipment.
As healthcare facilities encountered challenges, Tufts-New England Medical Center was among the healthcare facilities that faced financial difficulties during the 1990s. The medical center failed to establish crucial network alliances with other hospitals, negatively impacting Tufts-NEMC. Nevertheless, Tufts-New England Medical Center managed to utilize federal urban renewal and hospital construction programs to finance an ambitious expansion program intended to enable it to compete with other esteemed Boston hospitals. This was due to current CEO Ellen Zane, who made significant efforts to effect changes to restore this hospital's prominence. This document will offer an extensive analysis of the case study focusing on the issues confronting Tufts/NEMC and the strategies the organization employed to prepare for change.
The Various Aspects of the Issue
Tufts/NEMC's financial standing remained precarious; the company reacted sluggishly and ineffectively to changes in the business environment. The cash flow management and operational efficiency enhancement process were dysfunctional. Moreover, Harvard-Pilgrim Health Care declined to offer insurance coverage for Tufts/NEMC, citing high expenses. Tufts/NEMC started seeking partner organizations in 1997 to alleviate its financial instability. The company's top leadership opted for a merger with Lifespan Corporation in Rhode Island as it was expected to enable the company to expand and enhance its activities in academic medical center expansion in Rhode Island. Top management underestimated the intricate nature of merging two distinct organizational structures and their consequences.
Following the Lifespan merger, Tufts/NEMC lost its identity. They also ceased communication with the Mayor’s office and Beacon Hill. Tufts-NEMC incurred a monthly loss of $6 million since separating from Lifespan. Despite making progress with Schottland’s initiatives, Tufts-NEMC fell behind industry standards in numerous areas, including days in accounts receivable, days in accounts payable, the average length of stay, operating margin, and days cash on hand. For example, the various components of the ‘length of stay’ issue encompassed attitudes regarding patient care, procedural breakdowns, absence of feedback to physicians, and the utilization of ‘PICC lines’ in the email address. The impacts of each element on the organization are significant; for instance, PICC lines were more dependable IV lines that allowed patients to continue their medication at home. PICC lines had to be inserted by specially trained nurses, and often the physician discharged the patient too late in the day, rendering these nurses unavailable.
After assessing the managed care contracts, Ellen Zane uncovered that Tufts/NEMC was severely underpaid. Another obstacle for Tufts-NEMC was its magnitude; the components of the issue comprised competition, marketplace, and volume of cases. Tufts/NEMC would be deemed a notable player in any other market, but it was overshadowed by Partners, CareGroup, and Caritas in Boston. Maintaining the level of services and research demanded by a major medical center was exceedingly arduous for an organization lacking the volume of cases or endowments compared to rivals.
The Community's Requirements in Relation to the Organization
Analyzing the community's requirements concerning the organization is crucial for success. Tufts/NEMC, for instance, scrutinized the needs and was the first to anticipate a community medical service for the underprivileged. Consequently, the hospital promptly established a reputation for innovation. Furthermore, the hospital realized that assigning nurses to patients, forming a visiting nurse association, and founding “dental, rehabilitation, venereal disease, lung, food, and nutrition, and evening pay clinics” were imperative (Ingols & Brem, 2016, p. 452). Tufts/NEMC was the initial provider of employer-paid clinic treatment, well-child services, and mobile x-rays based on the community’s needs.
The tradition of innovation has persisted in recent times, with pivotal programs in cancer treatment, transplants, and neurosurgery. Tufts/NEMC became Boston’s primary full-service, private teaching hospital in 1992 when it integrated a maternity service (Ingols & Brem, 2016). Upon joining the organization, Ellen Zane grasped the significance of engaging with the community because identifying and fulfilling needs impact the organizational reputation and performance. For instance, Zane expressed that she recognized the significance of parking and employee work ethic by simply consulting community physicians. Obtaining thoughts and ideas from the community is immensely advantageous to the organization. Therefore, it is essential to address and meet those needs to enhance community outcomes.
Strategies Utilized to Enhance Recognition of the Necessity for Change
The ADKAR Model comprises five fundamental strategies or phases: awareness, desire, knowledge, ability, and reinforcement. The ADKAR lifecycle, according to Galli (2018), commences with acknowledging a change. Informing employees of the need for change within an organization is denoted as ‘awareness.’ At this stage, the main concern is determining the extent of change for a specific project. Employee and project team ‘desire’ involves the motivation to engage in the change and the capability to execute the required adjustments. Consequently, employees must comprehend how to change and the implications of the change. ADKAR emphasizes ‘Ability,’ which are the competencies necessary to implement change consistently. To instill and perpetuate change in the organization, ‘reinforcement’ is imperative.
For instance, Ellen Zane utilized communication and outreach to elevate awareness and desire within the organization. Since the hospital operated around the clock, Zane arranged a series of meetings during the day and night to ensure everyone had an opportunity to participate. Zane opted to conduct the meetings semi-annually across all shifts as they effectively disseminated information. Additionally, she supplemented them with regular emails in which she kept employees and physicians informed about financial matters and other issues. Ellen Zane employed various channels to disseminate information and oversee the turnaround endeavor (Ingols & Brem, 2016). Moreover, she reached out to physicians to promote her message of change while also retaining them amidst widespread recruitment efforts from other AMCs. Zane invested considerable effort in retention and recruitment to concentrate on ability, knowledge, and reinforcement.
How an Organization Effectually Challenges the Status Quo
Significantly, the status quo pertains to a situation devoid of change. Page and Schodler (2019) contend that individuals find transitions psychologically challenging as they find solace in the status quo. Employees typically find comfort in their traditions and established behavioral patterns. Essentially, organizations do not transform due to novel systems or
