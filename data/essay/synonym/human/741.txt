Sex trafficking is a significant and frequently disregarded issue of contemporary societies globally. According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (2009), sex exploitation is the primary reason for human slavery, constituting approximately 79% of all instances. In my perspective, such a violation is driven by individuals' avarice, lack of media attention, and governmental focus, along with the existence of substantial demand. Concerning the latter, frequently unacceptable forms of sexual desires and the quest for lower prices act as the significant impetus behind the sex slavery market.

Nonetheless, what is more crucial is the lack of acknowledgment from government officials and other establishments towards this dilemma, resulting in extensive public ignorance. On one side, the actual and potential victims are unaware of how to identify sex traffickers and react when they come across them. On the other side, the general population harbors bias that most sex workers have autonomy in choosing to trade their bodies due to an inability to secure alternative employment, substance abuse, or other causes. However, contemporary studies and inquiries into this subject disclose that this is untrue in numerous instances. For this reason, women were previously censured for vending their bodies instead of the men who coerced them.

For a similar rationale, some of the males who utilize the services of sex workers are oblivious to the fact that they are endorsing the offense. Nevertheless, there are others who realize that they are engaging in sexual interactions with minor girls or enslaved females and should face repercussions akin to those who traffic women. Nevertheless, I believe that the former faction can still be faulted for their ignorance because many clients of such services perceive sex workers as an item. This, in turn, results in the incapacity to show empathy towards these women.

To tackle this issue, as previously stated, the government, particularly in regions with high instances of women trafficking, should ensure that women are knowledgeable about how to elude capture. Moreover, in my viewpoint, the authorities should exercise complete oversight over a few adult resorts and frequently monitor their operations. Lastly, concerning trafficking in developing nations, the U.S. should actively engage in endeavors to cease this practice and encourage other nations to partake in these initiatives. In this aspect, I am of the opinion that only through the collaborative efforts of all countries can humanity bring an end to sex trafficking.
