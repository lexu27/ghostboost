An initial response speed is an immediate rate at the start of the reaction. The chart has the y and x-axis, y represents the density of moles per liter, and x represents time in seconds. In this scenario, the chemical response is progressing against time; at the start of the reaction, the chemical density is very high, thus regarded as a favorable reaction. As time progresses, the incline decreases, resulting in a negative curve; hence, the reactant density decreases within a timeframe.

Immediate rate is an immediate rate in time with differential rate, the reactant against time. The immediate computation is by ascertaining the negativity of the incline and the curve for the density of the moles per liter against time in seconds (Du et al., 2021 p 3154). Rate is equivalent to the negativity of the incline over time in seconds; this establishes the immediate rate and the variance between them, providing the instantaneous rate.

The response rate determines the mean over a time span by dividing the change in moles' density per liter over time per seconds' period by the time span. Obtaining an average is by noting the contrast in the reactant's density using the formula where the parentheses signify the focus on the reactant. A minus symbol is applicable when the rate is of a positive figure from the preceding formula. Nonetheless, the negative symbol is unnecessary to ascertain the employed products' mean rates. Deriving the mean from B to G is by summing all the density intervals and dividing them from B to G to obtain the norm. In conclusion, at the initiation of the reaction at point A and time 0, the density of moles per liter was high, while at point G, the engagement was low.
