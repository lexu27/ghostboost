Biomedical exploration involves direct engagement with individuals, and regulations are in place to establish limits for examining subjects in an ethically appropriate way. Following horrifying trials carried out on humans during World War II, moral guidelines were instituted to oversee scientific work and prevent harm or disrespect to the participants (Piasecki & Dranseika, 2019). History has shown that while swift technological advancement is unattainable without investigation, consideration for subjects must always be demonstrated irrespective of potential complications. Current studies incorporate ethical deliberations, and peer-review panels also scrutinize if the biomedical investigations have questionable aspects in their methodologies. This article aims to explore the influence of the history of research ethics on contemporary approaches and the safeguarding of the rights of human subjects.

Ethics are crucial for biomedical exploration as their procedures involve direct intrusion into an individual’s personal space, physique, or mental well-being. The history of guidelines commenced with the Nuremberg Code established in 1948 which stated that no research could be conducted on an individual without their voluntary agreement (Dawson et al., 2020). Another significant element of research ethics in biomedicine is the Declaration of Helsinki which outlined the standards that, for instance, forbid the execution of studies without prior laboratory testing on animals (Piasecki & Dranseika, 2019). The regulations address fundamental principles such as regard, beneficence, and fairness through informed authorization, risk evaluation, and equitable outcomes prognosis. Understanding the history of research ethics influences the perception of biomedical studies by emphasizing the precedence of human rights over any scientific advancement, even if it assures advantageous outcomes for healthcare.

Numerous contemporary and traditional biomedical research articles have been reviewed and examined throughout the nursing educational curriculum, and diverse ethical considerations were observed. Moreover, while working on the PICOT inquiry, the most recent investigations concerning the COVID-19 pandemic were evaluated and can exemplify the protection of human rights. The practicum issue for which the PICOT framework is applied is the escalating number of missed follow-up appointments by underprivileged patients in the local clinic (Dawson et al., 2020). Studies regarding the identified populace and the impact of non-attendance on their health outcomes and service quality were chosen for retrieving proof to devise an intervention. For instance, the article “Adverse effects of COVID-19 lockdown on mental health service access and follow-up adherence for immigrants and individuals in socio-economic difficulties” is grounded on scrutiny of patient documents (Aragona et al., 2020). The data was de-identified, and no informed agreements were signed; nevertheless, it lacks adequate protection of human subjects’ rights. Indeed, there is no assurance that patients are aware that their health information might be utilized for scientific or pedagogical intentions.

Another research on missed follow-up appointments and the specific demographic is “‘Missingness’ in healthcare: Associations between hospital use and skipped appointments in general practice” conducted as a retrospective cohort study. Researchers sought to ascertain the correlation between deteriorating conditions of participants and the heightened frequency of accessing healthcare facilities and analyzed patient records for evaluation (Williamson et al., 2021). Even though the chosen articles are unrelated to biomedicine and do not involve direct interventions, they indicate that research ethics still require reinforcement. For example, organizations can devise a policy that informs all patients that their records may be utilized for educational or scientific ends and necessitates a signed document to permit analysis of personal data.

The history of research ethics provided valuable insights on prioritizing human subjects’ rights and upholding the principles of justice and beneficence. Undoubtedly, scientific interventions must have limits that cannot be exceeded despite the call for further advancement, and participants must always be informed about the methodologies of the studies. The examination of articles related to the PICOT inquiry regarding the impoverished population missing their follow-up appointments revealed that researchers may still underestimate the ethical considerations.
