The commencement of novel genetic technologies that enable individuals to find and alter genetic codes has garnered many varied viewpoints on the technology. Particularly, the discourse on genetic alterations revolves around the potentials of human embryo modifications and moral considerations regarding the aftermath of such experiments. Specialists have apprehensions about the societal problems that could arise with the extensive implementation of genetic modification initiatives like CRISPR. This composition will investigate some pivotal instances from videos, an article, and a movie that highlights the topic of ethics in genetic engineering and articulate arguments opposing genetic alterations.

Initially, in his TED talk Paul Knoepfler proposes that the genetic modification of human infants is akin to designer items for their cost, excellence, and status attributes. Knoepfler (2017) elucidates that the scenario where the non-use of genetic alterations for offspring will be frowned upon is nearer than it appears. Nonetheless, the writer also describes the situation is fabricated solely to underscore the impact of such potent technologies. In actuality, it is more probable that genetic modification will assist individuals in becoming healthier by eradicating the genes that carry hereditarily transmitted illnesses. I believe it is crucial to recall that human evolution took a lengthy period, and any interferences from external sources may disrupt the equilibrium of human existence and pose a potential hazard.

Subsequently, another video on CRISPR technology proposes that genetic alteration has been one of science's top priorities since the revelation of DNA. CRISPR notably decreased the duration needed for genetic alteration experiments from one year and beyond to several weeks, constituting a substantial technical revolution (Kurzgesagt â€“ In a Nutshell, 2016). Furthermore, it significantly slashed the total expense of genetic adjustments, and now genetic alteration experiments can be conducted in any laboratory. In my viewpoint, such accessibility of technology presents a flaw rather than an opportunity, as extensive utilization of the technology by inappropriate individuals could lead to clandestine or illicit human genetic alteration laboratories.

Moreover, the article by Caplan et al. (2015) examines how even non-human genetic adjustments could inflict harm on the ecosystem. The authors depict how gene drives are inherited by offspring in the mosquito community. Gene drives could be utilized to halt the proliferation of ailments; nevertheless, the procedure will yield unforeseeable outcomes on the populace (Caplan et al., 2015). Consequently, even though the CRISPR technology substantially enhanced the duration and cost of genetic modification procedures, external supervisory bodies should meticulously scrutinize the experiments and their possible ramifications.

Lastly, the apprehensions articulated in the videos and article were delved into much earlier in sci-fi literature and movies. Despite in popular culture, genetic experiments are commonly viewed with a pessimistic undertone and are frequently linked with eugenics carried out by governmental regulatory regimes. For instance, Gattaca is a movie issued in 1997 that concentrates on the future where genetic modifications serve as the cornerstone of societal structure. The film underscores the imperfections in the system, as some privileged valid individuals possess flaws not intrinsic in ideally modified individuals and in-valid individuals exhibit more physical vigor than their flawless counterparts. Gattaca (1997) presents a case against the utilization of genetic engineering as it illustrates how genetic foundation could be coercively utilized to restrict individuals' life objectives and ambitions.

Hence, while genetic alteration could be employed to eradicate deficiencies such as hereditary ailments, genetic engineering should not be utilized in humans due to possible threats to the populace and moral apprehensions. Finally, before advancing into the epoch of genetic modifications, scientists should be mindful of the potential exacerbation of society's schism into proponents and adversaries of genetic alterations.
