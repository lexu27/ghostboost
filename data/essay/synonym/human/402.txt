The Monarch, penned by Nicholas Machiavelli, is a crucial addition to the contemporary notion of politics. In a way, this piece goes against the philosophical heritage of ancient political philosophy in which political application is overshadowed by the idealization of authorities and utopian towns. Conversely, in Monarch, Machiavelli (2014) establishes that the actual execution of politics involves genuine scenarios with real individuals whose conduct, choices, and deeds typically are not inherently ethical. The primary subject of "The Monarch" by Machiavelli is royal governance and survival. This writing was deemed as a manual for policymakers on the utilization of ruthless, self-serving shrewdness and sparked the expression "Machiavellian". Machiavelli (2014) elaborates extensively on how a leader should behave in different scenarios or contexts and confirms that the primary objective of politics is the effective retention of authority. The publication had a long-term impact on political philosophy as in it, Machiavelli opposed the conventional stance on politics that caters to the populace to a kind-hearted self-interest, where the ruler is egocentric and concentrated on his pursuits. The publication validates any methods as long as they assist the governor in achieving his objectives. According to Hobbes, individuals are self-centered, acquisitive, and pursue personal benefits. Self-interest is proclaimed to be the principal motivator of human conduct. However, Hobbes does not denounce individuals for their self-serving tendencies, does not believe that they are wicked by nature. Many individuals view Hobbes' perspective as pessimistic since it is excessively simplified and not all actions can be accounted for by self-interest. For instance, there are numerous individuals and charitable groups that contribute their funds and time without charge without any personal advantage. As for me, I find human nature infinitely more intricate than power-seeking persons depicted in Hobbes's composition.
