The creators of the Constitution did not believe that citizens would participate actively in the political life of the country. While many freedoms were included in the Constitution, its creators questioned whether people were interested enough in politics to follow its developments. It is accurate that in those times, information was restricted; however, nowadays, mass media assist people in being well-informed about political events. Furthermore, the media serve as a watchdog on the governmental authorities (How Does the Media Affect Politics). News agencies report the events and enable readers to form their opinions about them or express their views (How Does the Media Affect Politics). Nevertheless, it is always advisable not to rely excessively on the media and make an effort to track the political life of the country. They believed that ordinary citizens were uninformed and indifferent to what was happening in our government.

I dispute that citizens are uninformed and apathetic about political life. Nowadays, there are numerous organizations that advocate civil rights and freedoms closely monitoring the events on the political scene of the country. People do not wait for a crisis to voice their opinions; conversely, citizens strive to stay well-informed about current affairs (Jach & Trolian, 2022). The media, as a valuable source of information, facilitates this endeavor, granting people access to the latest events worldwide (Greenberg & Page, 2015). Crises like these heighten people's interest in politics, but there are many individuals who make an effort to express their opinions, regardless of the political or economic circumstances. These individuals deserve immense respect as they function as overseers of the broad judicial, legislative, and executive authorities entrusted to our politicians and judges by the laws we have embraced as a nation.
