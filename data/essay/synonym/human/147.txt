Elephants waltz the polonaise, ocean lions juggle spheres, bears pedal bicycles, a tiger leaps through a burning circle â€“ all these are spectacles with four-legged artists that excite the audience, particularly the young ones. However, animal welfare activists have raised the alarm because circus stunts are unnatural for wild animals; they are seen as ridicule and abuse. There should be a comprehensive ban on the exploitation of animals in circuses, as this matter goes against compassionate treatment and is a direct infringement of their rights.
Since the 1970s, many countries have been enacting laws to care for animals and ensure their basic safeguarding. Global treaties were made, acknowledging that animals are sentient beings whose fundamental requirements must be honored and safeguarded (Marino 148). Notably, the routines trained to animals for the audience's amusement have nothing in common with their innate conduct. The sole method to make them comply is to penalize and starve them so that the deprived, starving creature will do anything for a desired morsel (Arnold-Foster 146). Animals should display and exhibit behavior characteristic of their species, and the notion of circuses conflicts with this principle.
Moreover, the term "animal entertainers" frequently elicits favorable sentiments because performing is always linked with glamour. Nonetheless, unlike their human equivalents, animals never willingly select the profession of an actor. Circus existence signifies forfeiting freedom perpetually, spending 95% of the time isolated, in a confined crate where animals cannot stand up to their full stature and pivot (Ward 131). They endure significantly, but there is nothing they can alter because humans are more considerate and craftily apply coercion.
It can be deduced that establishing constraints on the exploitation of animals in the circus is an essential step in the current world. Creatures should be allowed to heed their instincts and be in their native environment because that is their intrinsic liberty. Everyone should perceive that animal rights should be safeguarded and, therefore, one must decline attending shows that have been produced through violence and brutality.
