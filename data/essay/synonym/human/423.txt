There is no straightforward response to what it signifies to be human. Some might argue that being human implies being self-reliant and managing their personal lives. For other individuals, being human signifies utilizing the advancements of civilization, wearing garments, and going to work every day, i.e., doing everything that animals cannot achieve. It is also intricate to state how individuals aspire to exist because each person possesses unique needs, aspirations, and opinions on this matter. This composition contemplates the On Being podcast and addresses the aforementioned inquiries.
In the podcast, Thich Nhat Hanh elucidates why individuals need to be human. According to him, “we have to remain human to be able to comprehend and to be empathetic” (Onbeing.org 30:53 – 30:58). The monk adds that being human implies having a privilege to make errors, but the lack of a “privilege to persist in making errors” (Onbeing.org 31:15 – 31:20). Hence, being human signifies being attentive, accountable, and open-hearted. In essence, being human revolves around being compassionate. Individuals dwell in a realm of aggression and horror and are unable to even communicate with each other productively (Onbeing.org). Consequently, they fall short of comprehending which lifestyle is authentic. From the statements of Thich Nhat Hanh, it could be deduced that individuals yearn to exist without fury; they desire to exist thoughtfully and be in command of their emotions. Nevertheless, an average contemporary individual could scarcely attain this mode of existence.
On the whole, the podcast is exceedingly motivating as it is devoted to being human, dilemmas individuals confront in the contemporary frenzied world, and methods to evade them. The Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh establishes an impression of a mindful individual whose notions should be regarded seriously. Despite not sharing the Buddhist perspective, I profoundly respect the character of Thich Nhat Hanh since he encouraged me to delve deeper into mindfulness routines.
