Preface
With the contemporary global concerns about sustainable development, the matters of food waste and environmental protection have become more prominent and more effectively addressed. With prevailing issues of inadequate nutrition and food insecurity due to the disruption of traditional food consumption customs, sustainable eating is endangered (Huambachano, 2019). Indeed, human eating behaviors and the general culture of food consumption are subject to scrutiny to detect trends that may have an impact (positive or negative) on the environment from both short- and long-term viewpoints. Daily routines of consuming food, preparing meals, grocery shopping, and handling leftovers and waste constitute the entire conduct of individuals regarding food. They are commonly linked with the ecological perspective that predominates in an individual’s overall perspective. Hence, it is pertinent to review and modify the ecological perspective to rectify harmful or unsustainable eating habits by participating in spiritual practices for improved sustainable outcomes. This document provides a contemplative examination of the author’s eating habit-informed ecological perspective, their connection with nature's well-being, and potential spiritual practices to enhance sustainable food consumption.
Ecological Perspective Examination
The assessment of one’s ecological perspective should be grounded in the observation of practices and behaviors rather than evaluated theoretically. In this way, the identification of a specific paradigm is more impartial and practical. For that reason, the foundation for this evaluation is the log of a seven-day eating habit diary that I have finalized for the purposes of this assignment. The data documented in the food habit chart allows for classifying my ecological perspective as stewardship. This deduction is confirmed by the minimal waste I generate after each meal, which aids in safeguarding the environment from contamination and averting the risk of excess production in the long run within food systems. Indeed, most days, I did not generate any waste, while on other days, no edible food was discarded except for some fries. Furthermore, the stewardship ecological perspective involves caring for the planet by regulating the utilization of resources. In this context, my integration of occasional home-cooked meals with takeout food contributes to the balanced intake of food.
To perform a thorough assessment of the ecological perspective based on my food consumption patterns, it is pertinent to scrutinize my approach from three fundamental standpoints, namely philosophy, faith, and morality. Within the philosophical spectrum, my logs of eating habits suggest that I lean more towards materialistic philosophy. Specifically, the review of the food habit log illustrates that the majority of my meals are consumed when I am alone, with infrequent shared dinners with my family. Moreover, I frequently order food from fast-food establishments to acquire meals promptly and to my preference without exerting much effort. I do not splurge on meals excessively, which validates my materialistic drive toward food consumption.
When examined from a religious perspective, my eating habits point to my alignment with pantheism, which denotes the interconnectedness of the universe and God. As indicated by my food consumption routines and the associated activities, I do not draw a distinction between the external world and God. I do not actively apply religious considerations to justify my food habits. Nonetheless, during meals, I view this time as a spiritual practice of linking my body with the world. From an ethical viewpoint, I most closely resonate with anthropocentrism. I curtail my concerns about purchasing groceries and cooking meals or selecting sustainably produced food. Instead, I opt for readily available food items to fulfill my immediate requirements. Additionally, I engage in concurrent activities, such as watching TV, checking emails, using my phone, and others while dining, indicating my prioritization of my emotions and gratification of my needs.
Nature Relationship Assessment
As my eating habits suggest, my connection with nature is marked by detachment and insufficient consideration. In the majority of my meal logs, I am unaware of the food sources, origins of meal ingredients, or production techniques. I do not ponder over these matters when making my daily food selections. The details that I gather about certain food items on my menu primarily come from the official websites of the establishments from which I order. It may lack objectivity and does not offer any insight into the impact of my food choices on nature. Furthermore, I am more concerned with the variety in my diet, evident from the diverse choices I make, albeit within a confined range of cuisines. Hence, the ecological impact of my eating habits is not a primary concern for me on a day-to-day basis.
Nevertheless, the identified stewardship ecological perspective urges me to pay more attention to the sustainable utilization of natural resources when consuming food. Specifically, the stewardship ecological perspective entails assimilating knowledge about the repercussions of specific production methods on the planet and mitigating harm through behavioral enhancements. This approach facilitates the shift of emphasis from an egocentric stance toward eating habits to a more nature-centric one. In this manner, the selection of dining venues and the items on the menu (or ingredients for home-cooked meals) should align with the optimal benefit for humans and minimal harm to the planet.
Spiritual Eating-Related Practices for a Healthier Relationship with Nature
Primarily, one of the spiritual practices linked to my eating habits might involve initiating family cooking sessions. There is a wealth of information online and on social platforms regarding cooking and advocating for a nutritious diet with sustainable food handling (Choudhary et al., 2019). Engaging in cooking activities will enable my family and me to bond, learn, and cherish the wholesome food prepared by ourselves. Additionally, I will have the opportunity to educate children about sustainable food consumption, thereby contributing to the sustainability of future generations. When selecting recipes and ingredients, I will be mindful of the natural resources utilized in their production and assess the impact on the planet. By doing so, I will harmonize with nature and raise awareness about ingredients, their source, nutrients, and health benefits. Furthermore, this practice will aid in managing food waste by preparing dishes based on leftovers. Overall, by cooking more frequently, including outdoor picnics, I will enhance my connections with nature.
Secondly, I will shift to a vegetarian diet to mitigate the environmental threats posed by meat production. Indeed, studies indicate that "excessive meat consumption necessitates intensive farming and animal husbandry methods, which are notably detrimental" (Nemeth et al., 2019, p. 4). Furthermore, in terms of spirituality and ethics, abstaining from animal-based foods will conserve animal life on Earth and reduce production-related harm to the soil and ecosystems.
Thirdly, another significant practice that could enhance my rapport with nature is sourcing groceries from farmers who guarantee the use of sustainable production practices for food items. Prioritizing organic food will be a substantial contribution to sustainable food consumption with potential advantages in the long-term well-being of the planet and nature. I will exercise logical reasoning and well-informed decision-making when selecting food items to ensure that the products I purchase and consume pose no harm to nature. Such a practice will promote sustainable consumption, bolster organic farming, and mitigate the damage from non-sustainable production in the long haul.
In Conclusion
To sum up, the discourse presented aimed to assess my ecological perspective, its implications for my relationship with nature, and the formulation of spiritual practices to enhance it. Overall, based on the records from my eating habit log, it was ascertained that I indeed align with the stewardship ecological perspective. This perspective allows for a certain degree of obliviousness to sustainability concerns with minimal harm to nature. The minimal
