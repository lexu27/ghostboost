I believe that I could become a supporter of the LGBT community. This community needs help because heterosexual pairs have unearned privileges and granted authority (Edwards, 2006). Specifically, heterosexual persons did not do anything particular to gain this authority, while members of sexual minorities are stripped of this benefit due to their sexual preference. From my perspective, this situation is not suitable and should be dealt with, indicating that I could serve as a supporter for social justice. Edwards (2006) specifies that individuals from dominant groups are also harmed, indicating that actions to obstruct, modify, redefine, and disassemble the existing systems are crucial to address the issue. This data suggests that aligning with the LGBT community can be beneficial for both the community and me.
My alliance would establish a bond with the marginalized community and concentrate on offering these individuals with the necessary support. An appropriate and efficient slogan should be devised to disclose my intention. It appears that the subsequent declaration is fitting: “Sexual preference is not as crucial as it appears.” These terms suggest that evaluating an individual based on their sexual preference is not rational.
Several important barriers can impact my alliance, including societal resistance and the hesitance of the target community to alter the situation. On one side, numerous traditional social groups and organizations can oppose my partnership because homosexuality is not suitable for them. Thus, it is vital to tackle this reality by educating people. Specifically, the emphasis can be placed on the fact that social suppression frequently leads to negative health outcomes for LGBT individuals. Conversely, the members of the selected community may be hesitant to advocate for beneficial changes, signifying that specific guidance should be arranged for them to involve them in the partnership.
