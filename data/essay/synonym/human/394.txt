The lawful question of agreement is quite an intriguing subject for discussion. The primary facet of this idea is agreement, which plays a crucial role in this procedure. To scrutinize this facet, the Georgia vs case can be employed. Randolph, which impacts the confiscation of evidence without authorization from the suspect. This work also examines what exemptions, in addition to the lack of a consent from a search warrant, can be applied to computers or other advanced evidence.

Before continuing to the consideration of cases linked to digital information, it is vital to comprehend what Georgia v. Rudolf case is. The defendant was indicted by his spouse of utilizing narcotic substances and the woman pledged to offer evidence of the accusations that were in their shared residence. However, if the partner agreed to the exploration of the property, the man declined and opposed him. Hence, the authorities gained access to the needed evidence, which was subsequently amassed after securing the order and the spouse was accused of cocaine ownership. Nonetheless, the court determined that since the wife had no acknowledged authority in the law to give agreement, she provided the authorities no more grounds for justifying entry than they would have had in the absence of any agreement at all. Thus, there was a breach of the Fourth Amendment, and the compensation claims of the state were not summed up to outweigh it.

The Fourth Amendment, which is the central legislative concept in this case, prohibits unreasonable searches and detentions. Furthermore, it implies the issuance of search warrants only if they are granted by a court with adequate grounds. However, research reveals that “the Supreme Court has never elucidated what makes an expectation of privacy reasonable, and scholars consistently grumble that this standard is incomprehensible and unworkable” (Tokson, 2020, p. 1). Therefore, if we apply this facet to Internet technologies and electronic information of an individual, the authorities cannot obtain this information without the direct agreement of the accused. This also pertains to the fact that the security authorities cannot heed the agreement of the roommates or neighbors, since these proofs are not their personal property.

Moreover, therefore, it can be deduced that the confiscation of evidence is legal with the authorization of one person when another, who will attempt to hide them and concurrently is present at the scene and explicitly declines to give consent unlawfully. The Fourth Amendment supports the fact of unauthorized actions for the uncoordinated acquisition of digital information and without a court order with the necessary amount of substantiated evidence.

Hence, using the case of Georgia v. Rudolph (2006) as an illustration, it can be deduced that law enforcement agencies, with assistance, can seize the necessary evidence on electronic media without consequences for the Fourth Amendment. The Fourth Amendment provides people the right to be secure in their residences and papers (Garrett & Stoughton, 2017). This is an intrinsic right that balances the governments need to investigate criminal activity while preventing unnecessary and unwarranted police intrusions. However, it is a limited right and is not applied to all searches and seizures. Additionally, it is a personal right and can be claimed only by the person who is the subject of the exploration.

On the contrary, the amendment prohibits unreasonable searches and considers many circumstances simultaneously. An instance would be the case United States v. Verdugo-Urquidez as a reasonable justification for the exploration, a set of circumstances were provided and the assistance and collaboration of foreign agents was emphasized (Bailey, 2018). The Fourth Amendment in this instance did not have its force in relation to the exploration of property belonging to a non-resident alien and situated in another country. An exemption in the absence of content may be the assumption by law enforcement agencies of the validity and evidence of their actions in line with the appropriate authority.

Another exemption is the instance when the electronic source of the necessary evidence has several hosts. Hence, if there is a password to the technology, a third party can agree to the data search. An instance of such a case was the investigation of the United States v. Smith (1999). Therefore, it is plausible to bypass consent, but this case can still be rebutted by the court as a breach of the Fourth Amendment.

Electronic advanced technologies store an immense amount of information about their users. Hence, in relation to the Fourth Amendment and applying it to electronic devices, agreement is required, which prohibits the acquisition of evidence. Furthermore, this amendment enables law enforcement agencies to conduct explorations to seize documents during criminal investigations and empowers judges to issue warrants authorizing police to seize suspects’ digital devices. The principal condition in this case is a detailed indication of the places to be explored and the items to be seized. Nonetheless, this factor can be circumvented if the electronic carrier has several users who possess the required password.
