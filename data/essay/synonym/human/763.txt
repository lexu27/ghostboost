According to Lufkin (2021), there is a pressing need to diminish the influence on physical and digital attendance in the age of pandemic and social changes. This article concentrates on the significance of identifying genuine motives for attendance and explains the effect of subconscious biases on employee relationships. Simultaneously, the mere exposure and halo effects are linked to unjust or inefficient promotions that determine the standard of work. The notion that numerous biases unreasonably endorse attendance and adversely impact performance is accurate, and distinguishing employees’ accomplishments using favors appears dubious. Attendance is challenging because most individuals persist in confronting their subconscious convictions about professional advancement. Lufkin (2021) observes that not all workers can arrive at work early and depart late to display their dedication to the organization. Some individuals prioritize instead of attaining work-life equilibrium and prospering as an employee and a parent. They are convinced that their presence at the workplace facilitates obtaining promotions or rewards, but the pandemic constraints have already demonstrated that remote work can be effective. Such attitudes toward attendance dishearten and enforce responsibilities that barely enhance performance. Nevertheless, the focus on the halo and mere exposure effects raises some inquiries and worries. The author acknowledges that leaders and managers perceive individuals who fetch coffee or interact as diligent employees (Lufkin, 2021). In today’s corporate world, management principles have been enhanced, and workers gain entry to new methodologies at various levels. Competent leaders will never elevate a worker due to an enhanced ability to brew coffee. If transformations at the workplace are grounded on trivial aspects, the progress of such organizations is questionable. For instance, there are two unwell persons: one is present but accomplishes nothing due to a runny nose and a headache, and another is at home but works online to meet the deadline. An effective manager evaluates the scenario and comprehends the current contributions of both employees. If attendance misleadingly influences the attitude toward these employees, the team’s professionalism is low. It is fallacious to assume that displaying faces at the office is a criterion for professional advancement. Lufkin’s article exposes worries about attendance and its influence on individuals’ evaluations. Occasionally, an individual requires a respite or a day off to work efficiently, and absence is not an indication of unprofessionalism and feebleness. Being present offers no assurances regarding the standard of work, and this assessment renders companies competitive and robust.
