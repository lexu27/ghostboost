A predicament is a period or an event which may lead to a perilous or unstable situation that distresses an individual, a community, or a group. It is an adverse alteration in environmental or human affairs, particularly when transpiring suddenly, with little or no caution. A predicament may assume various forms: being pilfered, assaulted, or tormented, confronting death or illness, or even losing a job. At times, it can be triggered by inner stressors such as hopelessness with undesirable self-talk. The predicament necessitates one’s attention; therefore seeking aid assists one in tackling a variety of issues they might not have contemplated. Early interference can significantly enhance one’s capacity to deal with what has taken place and its impact on their life. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, I was embroiled in a severe financial predicament that compelled me to seek urgent aid from several firms and individuals to intercede in my circumstance.
The Predicament
The COVID-19 pandemic was an urgent calamity that caught each person off guard and unprepared. I am one of the individuals who were adversely affected by the outbreak in numerous ways. I toiled in a specific company as a teller, and my life was flowing smoothly since I had some earnings to provide for our family. Although I had a steady income stream from the job, I had not pondered saving or investing a portion of the money. I also utilized the income to settle my fees since I pursued part-time studies in a nearby institution. I had formerly never encountered any sort of a financial predicament; hence I could not fathom that something like that might befall me.
Upon the announcement of the COVID outbreak, the government enforced stringent restrictions and regulations on businesses, such as the shutdown of hotels and restaurants to reduce the mingling of people. The regulations implemented were to curtail the transmission of the disease and hit numerous individuals through job loss, which occurred abruptly with no one’s foresight. I lost my job unexpectedly with no savings, no investment, or any other source of income, and I was the provider for our family. Consequently, that plunged me into despondency since I had no inkling what to do next, and everyone else was counting on me to provide.
Initially, I presumed the COVID outbreak was a short-term occurrence; hence I had little optimism of returning to work after some time. Subsequently, the catastrophe persisted daily with no signs of abating, and one day it affected our family. My parents contracted the disease, and later on, I fell ill as well. That was the most dreadful moment of my life since I had to seek treatment for them and myself though I was financially insecure. The situation compelled me to seek aid from acquaintances until it reached a juncture where they could not offer more support as the treatment became costly. I could not endure that any longer and resolved to apply for urgent aid from agencies since the entire family had descended into an unpleasant state. I sought urgent aid from Federal Emergency Management Agency. They aided our family in acquiring the necessary medication and provided financial support for a period until I recuperated.
Conclusion
A predicament can manifest in diverse forms, such as a financial predicament, and can occur at any time irrespective of economic status. Therefore, it necessitates prompt intervention through seeking aid from agencies, friends, or family members. In instances like the one I experienced, it is imperative to request any form of assistance. If one does not receive aid promptly after undergoing a predicament, personal distress may prolong and result in poor decision-making.
