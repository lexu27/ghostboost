It is common knowledge that various factors influence health when buying groceries. Among them, earnings and way of life were recognized â€“ both affect the quality of bought items. Consequently, households with low earnings prefer more affordable tinned vegetables instead of fresh ones because of a restricted budget. Also, individuals who lead a healthy lifestyle or are preparing for specific sports accomplishments are compelled to opt for more natural, hence, pricier products.
In reality, there exists a set of factors that could additionally influence shopping behavior and the intake of food that impact physical well-being. As stated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, social determinants of health encompass financial stability, learning, healthcare availability, surroundings, and neighborhood situation (Healthy People 2030, n.d.). Based on this roster, it is feasible to infer that the level of learning might also impact grocery shopping. For example, an individual who possesses knowledge concerning nourishment and is conscious of the adverse effects of snacks, sugar, and tinned food on health, will make every effort to steer clear of these items irrespective of his socioeconomic position.
