The predicament of enslavement in the United States is a intricate set of socio-economic, socio-political, civil-legal, racial matters, the origins of which delve deep into American history. The video broadcasted by Annenberg Learner (2019) delineates the clash progression between the North and the South, scrutinizing the human aspect of historical alterations. The primary points emphasized in the discourse are concentrated on the socio-economic variances between the two frameworks, the real existence of slaves, and strategies of blacks’ uprising.
To commence, it is noteworthy that the two regions composing a coalition, in reality, were not that culturally and ideologically distinct. The American society of the 1860s persisted, with limited exceptions, profoundly prejudiced. The North, in this regard, conceivably even ahead of the South, where whites at least did not hesitate from residing with their black slaves under the same roof. Enslavement in the North was annulled not for religious and moral, but for economic causes. Because of the climate, such labor-intensive sectors of agriculture as rice cultivation, cotton cultivation, tobacco cultivation, where slave labor had the most substantial impact, merely did not evolve. The manner the slaves’ emancipation was executed conveys a lot about the northern society, the extent of its contamination with xenophobia.
Moreover, the North and the South divided economic concerns since both aspired to develop western territories, the construction of railways. The South also employed northern vessels to seize new markets. However, as highlighted in the video, the Northerners did censure southern enslavement for its cruelty and barbarism, depicting horrifying tales of black individuals enduring from the regulations of establishments in which they found themselves, simultaneously harboring the same aspirations and aspirations as other Americans.
Furthermore, the second point pertains to the existence of slaves and how it used to be perceived in the South as opposed to the notions shared in the North in this context. Southerners warranted the enslavement system primarily by asserting that blacks were much jollier and safer. Additionally, the slave holders mocked and denounced the capitalist lifestyle of the northerners, deeming a free laborer much more powerless than the individuals of color. The principal argument in support of this stance was that slaves freely manifested their identity by singing folk tunes and preaching their traditions and religion. Concurrently, photographs of disfigured blacks and runaways’ tales expose the southern system’s atrocious aspect, awakening from the trusting and naive belief that enslavement will bestow more liberty and serenity. Hence, the real existence of individuals of color over time adopts more and more practical contours, elucidating the genuine meaning of the melodies of the enslaved ones.
Lastly, the discourse elaborates on the opposition to the system by the blacks themselves. The aspiration for literacy can be deemed an exemplification of the fight for freedom. Although this instruction was strictly not promoted by the proprietors, blacks comprehended that the route to liberation lay through the capability to read, write and articulate their ideas. Furthermore, the new desired arrangement was communicated through tunes, tales, and insubordination by the slave holder. Individuals of color crafted a realm where the feeble triumph, and the slaves become liberated in fairy tales and proverbs. They also endeavored to etch their liberated disposition through trivial and more severe disobedience, from theft to physical mistreatment.
In general, the video imparts substantial daily and cultural occurrences that are crucial for grasping the enslavement system and the antecedents of the American Civil War. Nevertheless, several specifics remain ambiguous in this conversation. First, since it was noted that the northern states were even more xenophobic, why did they so vehemently criticize the southerners, who, conversely, did not avoid being in intimate contact with the slaves. Second, given that the southern economy was trailing in advancement, why was the Confederation so averse to capitalism, particularly given its reliance on exports and the agricultural industry? It is challenging to envision that the matter of enslavement was so fundamental that the southern states were even prepared to depart the coalition.
