Conflict resolution at the workplace is one of the essential aspects associated with the organization of work in healthcare facilities. In this context, McKibben (2017) maintains that conflict is an unavoidable part of any human interaction, particularly when the collaborative activity is linked to physical, mental, and ethical intricacy present in hospitals. Consequently, if overlooked or not managed appropriately, the disagreements among the colleagues at the workplace result in reduced performance and satisfaction levels of the involved employees (Suifan, Alhyari, & Sweis, 2020). This, in turn, adversely affects the overall quality of provided patient care. Hence, it is crucial to address the conflicts promptly when they arise. Nevertheless, to comprehend how to handle disputes efficiently, one must grasp the factors that trigger them.
Broadly speaking, all the precursors of organizational conflicts can be categorized into three clusters, specifically individual, interpersonal, and organizational. Concerning the former, Kim et al. (2017) contend that the healthcare professional’s self-respect, self-centeredness, emotional intelligence, predominant reactions to conflict, communication approaches, and global outlook influence the frequency and intensity of the disagreements. Similarly, Chang, Chen, and Chen (2017) discovered that an individual’s certification level, age, and prior exposure to working in other groups can all impact the conduct during conflict scenarios. On the other hand, interpersonal conflicts arise from factors such as absence of reliance and regard toward an individual, authority misuse, and inefficient communication (Kim et al., 2017). Lastly, organizational conflicts originate from the general configuration and work setup. In this regard, factors like ambiguously outlined duties and inadequate hierarchy can trigger dissatisfaction and disagreements (Kim et al., 2017; McKibben, 2017). Consequently, this form of conflict emerges due to feeble or erroneous management choices.
I have also engaged in several disputes that can be elucidated by the aforementioned factors. Initially, I have a companion who is generally a decent individual but who is rather self-absorbed; thus, he frequently overlooks other people’s viewpoints. Because of that, we usually have to comply with his wishes, which eventually culminates in conflict when I grow weary of compromising. Secondly, I have observed that numerous conflicts between me and my parents and friends stem from my incapacity to manage one’s emotions. Lastly, once, we had a conflict with my peers while collaborating on the group project as we neglected to discuss the responsibilities of each individual beforehand.
