The YouTube video released by GP Synergy, “GP Training in Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services,” conveys a message that Aboriginal Medical Services play a vital role within the diverse community. The services are crucial for offering culturally aware and high-quality care to the target populations, often marginalized and underserved, making sure they have all they need to address increasing health concerns. The extensive range of services provided by the medical facilities guarantees that the patients from the Aboriginal community have access to affordable and convenient health care. One service can assist various aspects of clients’ lives.

The thorough approach toward culturally-sensitive care is particularly pertinent in dealing with the social determinants of health (SHOD), which cover various areas of the population’s health, well-being, and quality of life. SDOH comprises secure housing, communities, accessible transportation, racial bias and violence, education, earnings, job prospects, access to nutritious foods, poor air and water quality, and language and literacy proficiency (Healthy People 2030, 2020). Hence, the Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services strive to tackle the health gaps and injustices that most Aboriginal patients face (Pearson et al., 2020). The professionals operating within the Aboriginal Community Health Services framework emphasize the significance of patient education to ensure that the population is informed about its possible health challenges and understands the importance of early prevention and management.

The notable SHOD discussed in the “GP Training in Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services” video is bias. The health center staff acknowledge that many of their patients have encountered bias in the healthcare system and desire to receive culturally-aware services (Kim, 2019). Delivering such services is demanding because healthcare personnel are unaware of what to anticipate from each patient and must be ready to provide culturally responsive services (Jongen, McCalman, and Bainbridge, 2018). Care continuity is especially crucial in this scenario because when patients sense prejudice or lack of understanding, they are less inclined to revisit their providers for ongoing treatment or screening of their main health issues.

Although implementing culturally sensitive care and dealing with the SHOD of bias is challenging for providers, it is also extremely fulfilling. The patients facing bias wish to feel embraced, recognized, and looked after. Therefore, the employees of the Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services centers consistently prioritize developing meaningful connections with their patients (Luft, 2017). Furthermore, the professionals have observed that they have adopted the role of advocates who back their patients concerning healthcare services and their inclusion in their immediate community and the broader society.

Hence, the work of Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services professionals involves continual cooperation between themselves and their patients who feel underserved and misunderstood. In conclusion, addressing the social determinants of health impacting the Aboriginal community is a demanding process that requires commitment and centers on the unique requirements of patients arriving at a facility to receive culturally-aware care. Undoubtedly, the process will require some time as healthcare providers must be adequately prepared and knowledgeable about the social determinants of health influencing their clients.
