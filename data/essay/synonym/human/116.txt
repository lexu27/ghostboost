International labor regulations forbid making employment choices concerning individuals’ age and disabilities. It implies that Etihad Airways violated the current rules by implementing its strategy for layoffs. Given that social fairness is a key requirement for multinational companies, Etihad’s behavior can be seen as unethical and irrelevant. Increased employee participation in the decision-making procedure could have prevented this circumstance. This directly impacts performance and ensures that equitable decisions respecting the employees’ input are made. Therefore, Etihad achieved success in compensating employees for their effort and labor. Salary processing is a crucial element affecting job stability and employees’ drive, signifying that this choice aids Etihad in producing advantages and rehiring them in the future.

From the scenario, one can also observe that a decrease in job stability was a crucial factor linked with the transformation process in Etihad. The resolution to terminate employees led to a lack of trust among experts and diminished their drive and long-term schemes within the company. Hence, it is vital to secure employee roles to guarantee individuals are committed and execute their responsibilities efficiently. Prejudice was another element distinct to the transformation process at Etihad Airways. The enterprise neglected the corporate social responsibility matters, leading to an increase in discontent, lack of drive, and involvement. It suggests that the company dismissed potential alternatives that could have been utilized instead of its discriminatory methods undermining job stability and individuals’ willingness to work with such institutions.

Overall, the scenario demonstrates that insufficient employee engagement was one of the primary concerns in the case. The firm’s upper management instigated changes with minimal employee engagement. This caused the formulation of an unpopular and ineffective strategy that nurtured discontent among employees. Etihad Airways disregarded employees’ necessity for self-realization, diminishing their drive. The remaining employees did not perceive their importance to the company and the authority to impact its progress. It illustrates that contemporary employees should be granted the opportunity to engage in corporate decision-making to recognize their importance and become driven.

In an attempt to manage the payroll, Etihad Airways endorsed the incorrect choice, perceiving layoffs as the sole feasible alternative. The selection of disability and age as criteria for decision-making breached the current labor regulations. Also, it weakened job stability as employees acknowledged their fragile position. Outcomes demonstrate the poor efficacy of this approach. Concerning the lack of accessible manpower, the surviving employees began to endure burnout due to the elevated stress levels. Additionally, the absence of drive and involvement due to the aforementioned processes affected their performance. Consequently, Etihad Airways’ capacity to accomplish existing goals was impeded. The scenario highlights the crucial significance of employee engagement in decision-making during the transformation process as it assists in motivating them and identifying the most suitable choices.
