Chapter 9
The two primary ideas in chapter 9 of “Women in World History” are sex roles and women's liberation.
Sex Roles
Sex roles (SR) are societal roles assigned to each gender, irrespective of whether they are manly or feminine. SR is acquired early in a person’s life through a process called gender socialization. Women have been given feminine roles over time, which has restricted women’s chances in society. The Turkmen women were involved in nomadic carpet crafting from the comfort of their own residences (Hughes & Hughes, 1997). While men were transporting goods out of the family tents, women were responsible for tasks inside and around the shelters. Young women who had not yet given birth to their first children wove for twelve hours a day while older women managed the household. In the twentieth century, carpet weaving became a major industry in Iran, as it was in high demand in other western societies. Generally, the book describes how the allocation of work resulted in females handling household chores and males traveling and engaging in business deals.
Women's Liberation
Women's liberation is a term used to portray a western ideology that pushes for women's rights based on political and socioeconomic parity. However, the definition and objective of women's liberation have evolved to involve and acknowledge the interests of males as well. As per Hughes and Hughes (1997), women's liberation emerged alongside Middle Eastern nationalist movements in Western nations, driven by European notions of women's education, gender parity, individualism, and pride and disdain for Islamic societies. Due to the growth of international trade spurred by the railway and the Suez Canal, many women encountered lifestyle changes. Ultimately, When the Islamic Republic was established, the administration began revising laws regarding women's newly acquired rights.
Chapter 10
Chapter 10 of the book principally explores the influence of British authority on Indian women.
Gender Segregation and Women's Liberation
This segment, akin to Chapter 9, discusses sex roles; however, it centers on Indian women within this framework. The British arrived in India to enhance their commerce and boost their profits. The British colonial government initiated an educational scheme to train men to work as clerks in the civil service. Women were responsible for domestic tasks and the organization and management of family gatherings. Westerners had debates on the handling of women to justify their acquisitions of Asians and Africans. Some conservative leaders publicly ridiculed women's liberation, likening it to western fair demands. Ultimately, nationalists reacted with a plan of liberal reforms for women, which required a women's liberation perspective to transform the lives of Indian partners.
Women Seclusion (Purdah)
As per Hughes and Hughes (1997), “purdah” was a term used to describe seclusion and included women being isolated from society, particularly in Islamic tradition. The Indian National Congress, a nationalist group, contended that women should possess land and reside in nuclear families instead of secluded residences. Women in purdah were compelled to come out and actively join contemporary public gatherings. Indian women were liberated from social restrictions, not British colonial authority.
Poverty and Literacy
Dalit women were among the most impoverished in India, with a substantial rate of illiteracy.
Prejudice made it more challenging for them to rise above poverty, while the ongoing political dialogue exacerbated the matter of educational and occupational security. Rather than being perceived as human beings, males have regarded women as sexual objects. They have been suppressed for an extended period, making substantial lifestyle changes difficult.
