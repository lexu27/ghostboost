The proportion of individuals without health insurance in my state, Washington, is among the least. Specifically, it was 6.6% as of 2019, which is significantly lower than in Oklahoma (14.9%) or Texas (18.4%) (Kaiser Family Foundation, n.d.). In my view, the relationship between the socioeconomic status and access to care is apparent. The fewer opportunities a person has in terms of financial provision, the less feasible it is for them to afford high-quality health care. Individuals with low income are highly likely to be uninsured or eligible for Medicaid. Consequently, such citizens do not seek health care as frequently as it is necessary. Often, they only consult specialists in emergency situations, overlooking many other issues that necessitate prevention or treatment.

I believe that the primary reason why the proportion is low in my state is due to its geographical location. There are numerous employment opportunities in the state of Washington, which means people can manage to pay for health insurance. Additionally, individuals residing in this state are well-informed about their choices concerning health requirements. Besides that, the quantity of healthcare facilities is much greater than, for instance, in rural areas. All of these elements contribute to the elevated level of insured individuals.

Discussing the disparity in quality of care and access to health care, I should also mention such factors as racial discrepancies, access to education, and community context. In my state, it is simpler for individuals from various backgrounds to adapt and discover support. Nonetheless, there are regions of the country where some ethnic groups might be received with bias, which complicates their pursuit of high-quality education and finding well-compensated jobs.
