Individual liberties and national security are at times viewed as two opposites. Nevertheless, in theory, national security should demonstrate the balanced relationship between the two aforementioned concepts. Furthermore, the principle of the prevalence of individual liberties over the national security underlies the democratic idea. Individual liberties encompass individual rights and are safeguarded by the US Constitution (Longley). This article contends that individual liberties should never be compromised for the sake of national security.
This essay suggests that safeguarding individual freedoms while upholding national security is a fundamental principle and objective of democracy. US President Joe Biden remarks, “I firmly believe that democracy is the cornerstone of freedom, prosperity, peace, and dignity” (Biden 3). Unlike authoritarian or totalitarian systems, a democratic system prioritizes individual liberties over national security concerns. The application of this principle often sparks debate, as there is no single rule applicable to all situations. Nonetheless, individual freedoms are upheld in most spheres of social existence, encompassing migration, cyber defense, economic stability, and international diplomatic relations. Notably, actual cyber defense policy and practice adopt both people-centered and national-security-centered approaches (Deibert 411). In this context, states establish “indivisible network security on a global scale for the broadest possible inclusivity of the human experience” (Deibert 412). The aforementioned instance highlights the range of options for implementing the principle.
There may be an opposing view to the notion that national security concerns should override individual freedoms. This stance can be rationalized by an external menace or military ambitions and is typically endorsed by authoritarian regimes. This standpoint is flawed as national security should safeguard the welfare of every citizen, not the abstract notion of the nation. Every citizen is a part of the nation and their freedoms should be inviolable.
Hence, it was deliberated how individual freedoms should never be relinquished for the sake of national security. The call to compromise individual liberties is often advocated by authoritarian regimes whose true aim is to serve the interests of the regime. Conversely, in democratic nations, individual freedoms are fundamental and must not be infringed upon under any circumstances. These freedoms are sacrosanct and uphold the coherence of the democratic nations.
