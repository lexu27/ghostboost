In point of fact, organizational elements play an exceedingly crucial role in the execution and alteration of strategies, guidelines, and action blueprints in healthcare environments and decide their triumph. Therefore, comprehending and dealing with organizational culture (OC) have turned into a necessity for attaining enhanced healthcare efficiency. This study aims to explore the significance of OC for infection prevention and management (IPC) measures, the conceptual foundation of required cultural adjustments, and the function of leadership in them.
Generally, no shared explanation might unify all facets of OC in it. Nonetheless, the most fitting one was perhaps provided by Shein, who asserted that OC is “the pattern of basic presumptions that a given group has devised, found, or developed in learning to handle its issues of external adaptation and internal unity, and that has functioned well enough to be seen as valid, and, hence to be instructed to new members as the accurate method to perceive, think, and sense in connection to those issues” (De Bono et al., 2014, p. 2). Furthermore, the collective psychological programming on the basis of fundamental principles, regulations, traits, standards, and presumptions sets apart the individuals of diverse organizations (Valmohammadi & Roshanzamir, 2015). As healthcare-linked infections presently endure as one of the most significant obstacles to medical establishments, the effective execution of infection prevention and management (IPC) measures aids in decreasing infection-linked occurrences (De Bono et al., 2014). Nonetheless, efficient IPC distinctly relies on the interaction of various management systems influenced by OC. Specifically, the design of the organization and the configuration of distinct tasks are the key constituents of culture that decide employee conduct. Accordingly, employee conduct influences the prevention and management of transmittable ailments.
Numerous theories linked to cultural alteration are crucial for enacting measures that encompass the cultural adjustment theory, the self-efficacy theory, and the transformational theory of leadership. The initial one depicts cultural change as the production of value in response to evolving circumstances. It elucidates the essentiality for changes in OC in reaction to fresh challenges. The self-efficacy theory pertains to employee conduct alteration and specifies four forms, encompassing performance enactment based on an individual’s faith in their abilities, observational learning by observing others, verbal persuasion that alters conduct, and emotional stimulation (De Bono et al., 2014). Lastly, the transformational leadership theory accentuates leaders’ unique role in cultural transformation.
Despite various leadership manners that could be employed for cultural transformation, transformational leadership yields enduring effects. According to Willis et al. (2014), in organizational culture transformation, “alignment refers to the association between transformational vision and action through an array of activities carried out by those at various tiers of a system” (p. 9). Thus, capable leaders significantly influence their juniors, shaping their perceptions and behavioral trends. First and foremost, they express a new vision of OC boosting individuals’ drive and self-regulation (Fischer, 2016). In essence, in transformational leadership, employees are bonded by a specific mission where they are accountable for results. Concerning the execution of IPC, hand cleanliness may be viewed as the fundamental measure. Thus, instead of complete control, a leader articulates the significance of hand cleanliness for illness prevention and inspires employees to adhere to directions. In this scenario, healthcare providers realize their accountability for the success of measures.
