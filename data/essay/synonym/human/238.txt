Darwin’s evolution hypothesis of natural selection elucidates how diverse organisms came into existence and how others went extinct. In the hypothesis, evolution transpired from one generation to the next as they inherited physical and behavioral characteristics that enabled them to flourish in swiftly changing environments. This hypothesis commences by indicating that in ancient times, there existed organisms with contrasting characteristics i.e., either robust or feeble traits. Geological and other environmental alterations influenced the necessity for the survival of the species. Consequently, the organisms with more robust specific traits would survive and ultimately transmit the traits to their succeeding generations as they reproduce. The organisms with weaker traits would perish naturally leading to the extinction of their lineage (Flew 28). Darwin’s hypothesis of evolution was pivotal in deliberating the unique occurrences and advancements in human sciences. The hypothesis in itself elucidates genetics despite the absence of its knowledge at the time of its conception.
When correlating the hypothesis to the notion of human existence and the science encompassing it, it is evident to note how humans have achieved noteworthy progress in science with the aim of enhancing their world, asserting dominance, and comprehending every aspect of life to stay ahead of anything that may seek to eradicate them from the surface of the earth. Understanding the functionality of the human brain provides a clear indication of how the brain is highly evolved compared to other organisms and why humans persist as superior to other organisms. This clarifies why with each passing century, fresh advancements are made and new scientific inquiries are identified reshaping the world.
Scientific Questions Supporting Association of Darwin’s Hypothesis and Human Sciences
One of the scientific queries is the inception of life and the eradication of certain species. This query is utilized to ascertain the genesis of humanity and the divergence in the organisms existing presently compared to those that existed in former centuries e.g., mammoths. It also endeavors to investigate if humanity will endure or if we are also susceptible to extinction. Through the pursuit of obtaining answers, one can comprehend how evolution has influenced alterations in the life of diverse organisms as well as humans and how humans have delved deeply into the existence and evolution of life. The other scientific queries comprise:
 1. How has the mystery of life been unveiled over time? (How various individuals have sought to explore and sustain life).
 2. How exceptional is the human brain and what is its function in the human body? (History of researching the human brain and how the acquired knowledge has been utilized in the progress of the field of psychology and neuroanatomy).
 3. How does the brain influence our existence? (This clarifies the diversity in brain development at varying stages and among diverse individuals).
Confirmation of the Association Between Science and Society
The recordings demonstrate how knowledge evolved from one era to another and was constructed on the breakthroughs of prominent researchers and enthusiasts. All the knowledge served as guiding principles in the various scientific disciplines and new knowledge was appended to the existing data. The transformations noted from one era to another are predominantly attributed to scientific progress. Nations like Britain that prioritized science progressed swiftly and adjusted to the rapidly changing environments compared to other countries and this serves as an indication of the connection of science and society.
