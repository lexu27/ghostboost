Transport plays a prominent role in global logistics; presently, a digital upheaval is occurring in this domain, the pace of which is escalating due to the pandemic that has emerged globally. Digitalization is the element that unveils fresh possibilities in logistics such as hastening, reorganization of the business model, and offering a broader array of services. The rapidity of transformation is such that logistics does not have the time to reconstruct and results in interruptions in the supply chain. The operations of transport companies involve continuous cargo movement. To prevent the halt of global cargo transportation, it is crucial to digitize the five existing modes of transport. Although it is challenging to envision a completely innovative form of transport in the foreseeable future, the influence of new technologies (particularly of AI) on the Big Five presents numerous logistics prospects.
The characteristics of the Fourth Industrial Revolution – machine learning and artificial intelligence, big data and the Internet of Things – established the basis for a new strategy to manage the supply chain – Supply Chain 4.0 (Klumpp & Zijm, 2019). The turning point was the initial progress of AI-based cargo routing technologies by corporations. Supply chains comprise connections; the corporation has numerous such logistics connections: suppliers of components (raw materials), manufacturers, logistics companies, distributors, warehouses, carriers, retail chains, etc (Bowersox, 2019). The operational efficiency of all participants in the supply chain relies on the speed of this interaction and the quality of the shared information. With the inception of the Supply Chain 4.0 era, the logistics of corporations have become more foreseeable — facts, not a subjective perception of an individual, have taken precedence (Klumpp & Zijm, 2019). Furthermore, AI identifies such interrelations that an individual cannot establish, as there is no direct link between the data, and the volume of data is immense.
One of the most notable instances of the utilization of AI in the realm of logistics is predictive analytics systems. The conventional approach to route planning is grounded on a restricted number of factors that are predominantly static and do not consider current alterations. Leveraging AI, the model can integrate data on traffic, weather, waiting periods, loading and unloading rates at specific locations and at certain suppliers, the impact of particular company and customer staff on the delivery speed. By concentrating on real-time data, such a model will be capable of devising the optimal route with significantly greater accuracy and compute the ideal delivery time. This indicates that concurrently it is feasible to curtail expenses and delivery times and enhance customer contentment with top-notch service.
Presently, the worldwide market is dominated by the distinctive model that resembles a blend of sales channels. The omnical model’s approach is structured in a manner that the consumer should not discern the distinction between an online store and a physical store (Wang et al., 2019). Consequently, the number of small orders is rising, and the functions of stores that integrate both a retail space and a warehouse are evolving. Hence, it is imperative for a logistics company to assure prompt delivery of goods, transparency of the supply chain, clarity of the product life cycle, and the caliber of services provided. To accomplish this, new technologies are consistently implemented in the Big Five supply chain management: drones and artificial intelligence. This digitalization enables the consumer to monitor the delivery process from their home digital device, heightening trust in the manufacturing company.
By employing novel transportation technologies, the scope of supply is also expanding. For instance, drones can transport cargo by air; as the absence of a pilot and other maintenance personnel eases border crossings, the range of deliveries is broadening (Klumpp & Zijm, 2019). The introduction of intelligent roads, which encompass a unified concept comprising various technologies for regulating ground transport, also fosters the expansion of supply ranges. They encompass numerous components that aid in ensuring a more secure delivery of cargo promptly and conveniently.
The digitalization of the Big Five transportation modes has also exerted a substantial impact on transportation expenses. Robotics undertake responsibilities for the distribution of goods and the execution of logistics supply chains. Various advanced designs can supplant individuals, leading to significant savings in terms of salary payments. Even considering the maintenance of new technologies and the funding of their development, the resultant profit adequately offsets the extra transportation costs.
Modernization in terms of altering the Big Five transportation modes triggers a revolution in global trade. The observed trend of ameliorating the prevailing methods of cargo transportation will result in an upsurge in cargo traffic and have a favorable influence on all participants in the transportation process. At the current phase of technological advancement, novel approaches are devised to boost customer orientation through the integration of new technologies. Consequently, the Big Five transportation modes will be utilized much more effectively with the further advancement of artificial intelligence.
