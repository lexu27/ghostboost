Sexton, Anne. “Desiring to Perish.” Poetry Foundation, 1981, Web.
“Desiring to Perish” is a free verse poem with thirty-three lines split into eleven tercets (three-line stanzas). This poem has been termed one of Anne Sexton’s literary suicide notes as it is penned in the first person and is presented in a conversational manner. With an individual who has inquired about suicide, the author discusses the reasons for suicide and the allure of it in this poetry. The poem starts with a dialogue between the author and an unidentified interrogator. Sexton captures the essence of confessional poetry in this poem, as she candidly reveals her sentiments about the association with death and her ongoing battle with suicide. Though this poem seems to revolve around death and suicide initially, there are numerous instances in it that may be linked to substance addiction and the aims of the drug user. This poem’s mood is generally gloomily sorrowful as it crafts meticulously dark and gloomy imagery. Through precise personifications of suicide and death, it plunges the reader into the mindset of the suicidal notion.
Sexton, Anne. “Her Kind” Poetry Foundation, 1981, Web.
The orator of “Her Kind” adopts various identities that resist stereotypes of femininity, rejecting society’s expectations that women be attractive, nurturing, and compliant in the process. As per the author, being a woman who opts for autonomy over dependency, self-reliance over familial ties, and death over compliance means being perceived as a hazardous outlier—a witch who must be banished. Instead of alienating the woman, this independence furnishes her with a potent sense of unity with other non-traditional women: she is not solitary but one of a kind. The orator scrutinizes the diverse ways patriarchy confines women into narrow categories in each line of the poem—categories that the speaker refuses to be confined in. The poem “Her Kind” by Anne Sexton has a serene tone, with no explicit scenes or dialogue but a robust sense of narrative, emotion, and imagery. It emerges as an odd, nostalgic recollection of a lady who has long since perished, peculiar as that may be. Despite this, the narrator’s vitality, which starkly contrasts the poem’s destiny, contributes to the piece's infusion of an eccentric charm.
Plath, Sylvia. “Dad.” Poets.Org , Harper and Row, 1962, Web.
With brief allusions to Sylvia Plath’s marriage to British poet Ted Hughes, this poem unveils autobiographical facets of her association with Professor Otto Plath, who perished when she was merely eight years old. Like the prior works, this poem grapples with mental health, suicide, and the struggle between life and death. This intricately layered poem alludes to Nazis and Jews, vampires, and the devil. It is noteworthy that this poem is partly a farewell letter to her father, partly a confessional diary entry to herself. “Dad” strives to merge the intimate and mystical. It is chilling, like an unusual nursery rhyme about a split personality, a restrained onslaught aimed at a father and husband. Plath’s terror and sorrow are eloquently and ominously expressed in this poem. It blends cheerful echoes of a Mother Goose nursery rhyme with somber World War II resonances.
