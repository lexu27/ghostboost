Preamble
This ultimate assignment mandates that I formulate a Training and Organizational Development (OD) proposition aimed at enhancing diversity training at Cape Coral Hospital. It is crucial to mention that many organizations view the administration of diversity programs as not confined to HRD initiatives and procedures, but broadened to encompass the distinct requirements of the new employees. Hence, as the HRD supervisor for Cape Coral Hospital, my duty is to suggest novel training initiatives and procedures to senior management, and elucidate how HRD techniques can aid in overseeing a culturally assorted workforce.
Advantages of Cultural Diversity
Embracing and endorsing cultural diversity brings forth numerous advantages. Initially, having a varied workforce is crucial for any enterprise concentrated on realizing its authentic potential. Cultural diversity enables organizations to have a robust presence on the international stage and fosters enhanced innovation (Kamales & Knorr, 2019). Concerning Cape Coral Hospital, cultural diversity equates to more committed employees alongside increased retention rates and superior patient care quality. Other perks of diversity in the workplace encompass the promotion of diverse viewpoints, augmentation of profits and revenue, attraction of top talent, enhancement of global reputation, and streamlined problem-solving. An organization that neglects cultural diversity may encounter numerous issues such as legal battles associated with employment discrimination. In summary, by endorsing a more diverse workforce, Cape Coral Hospital will nurture an array of perspectives.
As the HRD supervisor for Cape Coral Hospital, recognizing and valuing employees is highly advantageous, particularly when they hail from varied cultures. This is pivotal since it fosters high innovation—when diverse cultures collaborate, there are more prospects for heightened creativity (Kamales & Knorr, 2019). Similarly, valuing employees engenders a sense of appreciation and empowerment among them. Based on these concerns, the recruitment process for new employees at Cape Coral Hospital should be approached comprehensively to ensure that minority employees do not feel marginalized.
Some Key Demographics
Currently, women constitute roughly 47 percent of the overall workforce. This proportion is projected to remain consistent until the culmination of 2022. Although the projections do not specify the exact percentage, an upsurge is expected due to a sudden rise in single-parent households. Furthermore, approximately 20 percent of individuals with disabilities according to ADA are part of the workforce (Sprong et al., 2019). This figure is anticipated to escalate in the forthcoming years. Lastly, the average workforce age is escalating daily.
Novel Training Programs
For the senior management at Cape Coral Hospital, there are pivotal novel training programs that I would recommend in a bid to establish effective recruitment and selection methods to attract more minorities. The new training programs for deliberation will commence at the apex of the organization. The triumph of the programs will necessitate the presence of a chief diversity officer within the organization to steer the training in the requisite direction. Most importantly, Cape Coral Hospital should institute a diversity leadership council to pinpoint areas necessitating additional attention.
Ethnicity and Race Identity Program
This training initiative is designed to aid the senior management in distinguishing between ethnicity and race. They ought to comprehend that ethnicity is a learned conduct while race is biologically ascertained. The goal of this training program is to identify the various groups of individuals prone to discrimination. This program will shape the development of effective recruitment and selection methods by including an unconscious bias course. This course will assist employees in recognizing their biases and, consequently, bridging the gap while fostering diversity in the workplace.
Disabilities and Physical Abilities Program
This training program endeavors to educate senior management on the significance of teamwork—it enhances employee engagement. Consequently, the program is vital as it instructs senior management on the reasons for and methods of ensuring the workplace environment complies with ADA regulations (Stevens et al., 2018). As alluded to earlier, about 20 percent of individuals with disabilities according to ADA are employed. This underscores the need for Cape Coral Hospital to cater to their requirements. The program also aims to remind senior managers of the advantages of hiring individuals with diverse disabilities.
Gender-based Training Program
This initiative is devised to remind senior management that gender is an internal diversity—a trait individuals are born with. The training program also aims to elucidate how gender discrimination manifests in various workplaces. Therefore, the gender-based training program will equip senior management with the tools to eradicate biases associated with gender, thereby fostering a more diverse and inclusive workplace. If implemented, the program will enable the organization to retain its employees while simultaneously attracting more minorities and women. The benefit of this program lies in its eradication of discrimination.
Age-related Training Program
This program is designed to inform the management that the hospital, irrespective of the era, will feature a workforce comprising individuals from diverse generations. These groups harbor unique ideals and beliefs which can give rise to biases, ageism. As per Zaniboni et al. (2019) ageism “is a tendency to harbor negative feelings against employees of different age” (p. 453). This training is essential since age discrimination can occur at any stage of life. This program will foster inclusivity within the workforce, rendering the company appealing to employees of all age brackets.
Citizen Status Program
This training is indispensable owing to the likelihood of encountering immigrants in any workplace. The predicament these individuals face is that despite possessing citizenship, there persists a schism with those raised in the area. Therefore, it is imperative for senior management to introduce this training program to eliminate unconscious biases in the workplace. Fundamentally, the citizen status training program will enhance the organization’s overall diversity. Consequently, this will introduce a myriad of ideas, thereby attracting more employees, especially from minority groups.
The Role of Senior Management
The senior management at Cape Coral Hospital has the prerogative to implement the aforementioned new training programs alongside other benefits such as flexible work schedules, onsite daycare, and childcare subsidies. This will entice new recruits and concurrently engender a sense of comfort among them while working for the organization. The senior management should articulate their appreciation for cultural and religious traditions, including holidays. The new programs should inspire the management to concentrate on establishing affinity groups that will empower staff on effective teamwork to meet patients’ needs.
Novel Training Processes
The fresh training processes that I proffer to senior management encompass: articulating their commitment clearly, fostering objectivity, scrutinizing and interviewing, and inclusive interviewing. Concerning the articulation of commitment, the senior management will undergo training on ensuring the representations on career pages epitomize their dedication to diversity. Additionally, they will be coached on communicating their values and commitment to diversity and inclusion. It is imperative to note that potential applicants are interested in understanding the organization's stance on certain matters before opting to join.
Encouraging Objectivity
Another novel training process the senior management will be schooled on is how to promote objectivity. Here, Cape Coral Hospital’s management will receive guidance on integrating a multi-tier approach into the organization's recruitment policy. For instance, senior managers should prioritize reviewing each candidate's resume and initial Q&A before the interview process commences (Epstein, 2019). The training will enlighten them on the necessity and methodology of mandating the first tier of screening. The objective is to enable the organization to sustain consistent assessment.
Scrutinizing and Interviewing
This training is geared towards establishing an effective screening mechanism to evaluate potential new hires. This program is crucial as it aims to address biases, whether conscious or
