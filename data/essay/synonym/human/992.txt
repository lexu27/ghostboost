Introduction
Dependence on the internet and mobile gadgets for conducting business results in the so-called E-commerce. The expression is relatively recent, stemming from its acceptance in the 2000s following the internet revolution. E-commerce is a significant force in the current and upcoming business sphere because of various aspects. For instance, the innovation's ability to eradicate reliance on the expensive brick-and-mortar business system renders it appealing to many investors. Similarly, e-commerce's distinct characteristics, like reduced entry barriers and easily accessible extensive supplies of online clients, render the element greatly valued. The innovation emerges at an opportune moment when the global population leads a hectic life, while its demands often surpass local producers' capacity.
The global swift adoption of e-commerce validates the innovation's alignment with people's distinct requirements. Individuals across the world no longer have to stroll or commute to purchase goods or struggle to locate unavailable items within sparsely situated stores as was common in the e-commerce era. Such unparalleled advantages establish e-commerce as a significant force esteemed by many.
Nothing underscores the essence of e-commerce more than the COVID-19 pandemic condition. Initially reported in the middle of 2019, the outbreak exerts substantial pressure on individuals by altering nearly every previous lifestyle. The shutdown of businesses to shield individuals from contracting the lethal infectious virus significantly altered working conditions (Saeed, Bader, Al-Naffouri, and Alouini, 2020). Organizations striving to endure the global epidemic consequently resorted to operating online, utilizing the internet and e-commerce tactics to navigate the challenging circumstance. Furthermore, the worldwide population heavily depended on technology to obtain life's essentials due to the implemented quarantines. Such advantages prompt many individuals to embrace the innovation unquestioningly without considering its impact on other fundamental aspects, such as the environment. Like any other facet, e-commerce showcases both beneficial and detrimental effects on the environment, necessitating moderation.
Positive Effects of E-Commerce on the Environment
In addition to simplifying and enhancing people's lives, e-commerce presents numerous favorable impacts on the environment. The ensuing discussion illustrates some of the innovation's benefits concerning the surroundings.
Transportation Emissions
The e-commerce business model functions differently from the conventional brick-and-mortar framework that necessitates extensive land parcels and a substantial workforce commuting to the offices daily. Relying on the internet implies that businesses vending products online necessitate fewer stores or smaller-scale machine-intensive production units capable of manufacturing items on demand (Gaffer, 2016). Hence, the reduced requirement for land parcels indicates a decline in the destruction of the natural ecosystem, thereby conserving the environment. According to Collins (2021), transportation stands as one of the primary contributors to greenhouse gases that significantly harm the environment. Therefore, having individuals work from home renders the e-commerce model environmentally beneficial by diminishing harmful transportation emissions from commuter vehicles.
Paper Waste
Business records play a pivotal role in organizations' sustainability, leading to the retention of nearly every detail of operations. Maintaining physical receipts, invoices, purchase orders, licenses, and other essential documents constituted a vital part of businesses' activities prior to the e-commerce era. Some companies even designated extensive record repositories to handle this aspect. Most of the paper utilized for storing such information, alongside paper waste from packaging materials, ended up in landfills, resulting in substantial paper litter with profound effects on the environment. Additionally, depending on paper for conducting business entails the felling of trees and deforestation to obtain essential writing materials. Consequently, e-commerce proves highly advantageous to the environment due to its capability to eliminate paper dependence and waste from businesses.
Digital Storage
Lastly, e-commerce advocates for digital storage while eliminating the need for warehouses that demand a substantial workforce and emission-producing machinery detrimental to the environment. Collins (2021) commends the advent of digital manufacturing strategies resulting from e-commerce as a viable environmental conservation initiative. Businesses operating online typically refrain from stocking large quantities of products due to space constraints. As a result, substituting large environmentally hazardous traditional storage methods with digital storage techniques underscores the environmental benefits of e-commerce.
Detrimental Effects of E-Commerce on the Environment
Transportation Emissions
E-commerce encourages unregulated purchasing and excessive order quantities compared to the traditional business model. This scenario compels investors to acquire numerous delivery vehicles to meet the escalating demand and urgency. These vehicles predominantly run on fossil fuels, thereby generating excessive emissions that damage the environment (LaRosa, 2001). Collins (2021) notes that the congestions resulting from the multitude of delivery vehicles lead to traffic, exacerbating the emission issue. Consequently, the intense movement of vehicles delivering small and large orders to satisfy urgent needs significantly offsets the benefit derived from individuals working remotely.
Packaging
The upsurge in consumer demand and the optimization of supply chain mechanisms entail a surge in packaging waste. Escursell, Llorach-Massana, and Roncero (2021) observe that virtually all items sold online come with packaging material that transforms into waste upon reaching the consumer. Directives to recycle or reuse such material often fall short due to consumers' perception that every desired item is available online. Consequently, this trend leads to landfills and the presence of detrimental plastic materials along riverbanks and oceans, negatively impacting the environment.
Product Returns
Ordering items online from an e-commerce vendor without prior physical interaction with the product fosters the challenge of product returns. The returned goods entail double transportation, handling, and potentially packaging, signifying a twofold environmental impact. This underscores specific issues with e-commerce, as this problem was not prevalent in the traditional business model. Hence, emissions from return vehicles and the waste stemming from handling and repackaging items underscore e-commerce as a genuine environmental menace.
Unemployment and Environmentally Unsustainable Survival Measures
The e-commerce model's reliance on a reduced workforce and intense competition with brick-and-mortar enterprises, resulting in their closure, directly contributes to unemployment and environmental degradation. Per Karine (2021), online operations in numerous developing economies worldwide drive previously employed populations towards environmentally detrimental survival tactics. Such practices inflict considerable harm on the environment; thus, the significant strain that online business exerts on natural resources through supporting unsustainable demand questions the model's sustainability, necessitating moderation.
