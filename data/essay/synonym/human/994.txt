Regrettably, middle-aged ladies may face a danger of pathological menopause. Consequently, it is crucial to consider what specific characteristics may worsen the issue. The writer of the post under review proposes that their patient with obesity and a tendency to breast cancer should take Metoprolol instead of Norvasc to alleviate the symptoms of premature menopause. Additionally, it would be beneficial to follow a diet and quit smoking. Such suggestions are certain to be effective as they align perfectly with the patient’s requirements.
Certainly, in the event of menopause, a patient's hormone levels and BMI are assessed to determine if there is a likelihood of severe damage. According to recent research, "sex hormone levels post-menopause are linked to women's heightened CVD risk later in life" (as mentioned in J Am Coll Cardiol, 2018, p. 2555–66). It seems logical that the patient under examination should halt Norvasc consumption due to its adverse effects, which increase the risk of heart ailments in the long term due to decreased physical activity. As a beta-blocker, Metoprolol is undoubtedly a suitable choice for this specific scenario.
Nevertheless, the patient's obesity status should be reassessed before prescribing a specific diet. Banack and their group of researchers carried out a study, the outcomes of which "show that a BMI cut-off of 30 kg/m 2 does not seem to be an accurate indicator of actual obesity status in post-menopausal women" (Banack et al., 2018). This indicates that rapid weight loss might be ineffective and even detrimental. The same applies to HRT usage given the patient's predisposition to cancer. Physicians argue that "although less efficient than HRT, SSRIs/SNRIs are proven to alleviate hot flashes and may be suggested for women who want to avoid the dangers of HRT" (Stubbs et al., 2017). Thus, HRT is not advisable as it is commonly thought to heighten the cancer risk.
In conclusion, the author's recommendations are likely to result in a successful alleviation of premature menopause symptoms. The proposal to substitute Norvasc with Metoprolol appears to be a sensible choice. Regarding HRT, it is crucial to minimize the cancer risk. Hence, SSRIs/SNRIs may emerge as the appropriate strategy for treating hot flushes. Nonetheless, the prescription of a diet should be reconsidered in light of new information.
