When conversing about Parkinson’s Disease (PD), the patient's care, both from the community and healthcare professionals, is a consideration. Therefore, my area of interest is the care and treatment of individuals suffering from PD and how their lives could be enhanced. I selected this area of interest because it is compassionate to witness patients struggling independently without proper care from the community and the healthcare system. The subject is a matter of interest because aiding the vulnerable in the community fosters an inclusive environment for all. Furthermore, tending to PD patients is a health concern because, lacking proper intervention, patients enduring this condition could develop more severe conditions and negatively impact their lives. I am of the opinion that PD is manageable, and patients administered appropriate medication display minimal difficulties adjusting to their lives. In exploring the subject, the key terms to use are ‘suitable caring for patients with Parkinson’s Disease, which produces a range of nursing journals to select from.
* P – Patients and individuals influenced by Parkinson’s Disease (PD).
* I – How does cooperative care and disease education aid in enhancing care management among patients with Parkinson’s Disease? Is it worthwhile educating members of society about PD? And what effects could it have on patients enduring this condition?
* C – Contrasts patients’ data with no cooperative care and victims encircled by uninformed individuals about the disease.
* O – Enhances PD patients’ care management and overall care.
* T – Over a 24-week period.
For the sustainability of this project, it is crucial to provide supporting proof on the significance of cooperative care and disease education among community members. Therefore, I plan to exhaust several nursing journals regarding caring for individuals and patients with Parkinson’s Disease. The aimed nursing journals whose content highlights the importance of PD education and studies endorsing cooperative care for these victims. This project primarily aims to validate the significance of PD education and the necessity for awareness of this condition in the community. Finally, at the conclusion of the specified period, the behaviors and the ease of coping with the condition among PD patients will be compared with stored data when the community was uninformed about PD. Therefore, there is a high anticipation of a positive outcome concerning efficient care and ease in managing PD patients.
My research concerning PD patients’ care continues as I found this article as crucial as the two discussed articles. This article’s main point is shifting care of the PD patients from hospitals to community care. According to Aye et al. (2020), integrated multidisciplinary care in collaboration with other healthcare professionals is the key to managing PD patients and their conditions. Moreover, the article presents insufficient expertise, poor interdisciplinary collaboration, and communication to deliver care to PD patients as the core challenges facing the shifting process. Since full shifting to community patient-centric care would be difficult, the research proposes programs such as PD training and Telemedicine to realize the dream shortly (Aye et al., 2020). This article further narrows down and points out the role of multidisciplinary care in PD and the limitations exhibited by PD patients in the community. This research was based on Singapore’s PD model of care. According to Aye et al. (2020), PD is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, as the research found that more than 6000 people are diagnosed with the disease. Hence over congestion of PD patients forced the birth of Patient-Centric Care outside the hospitals.
In my view, I found this source biased as tending to individuals suffering from PD is concerned. The article does not elucidate the programs that ensure that these patients receive the utmost care outside the hospitals. Furthermore, lacking proper education and the provision of Telemedicine, numerous homes that care for PD patients would have a tough time as they do not receive quality care. Nonetheless, I concur with shifting PD care from hospitals to the community because various hospitals do not possess adequate facilities to handle the figures quoted in the case of Singapore. By doing so, caregivers and other healthcare professionals find it simple to care for patients with severe PD conditions. Perusing the article provides insights and knowledge of PD and the rationale for ultimate patient care. With the increased PD condition, this matter is a nursing situation and a global matter of interest to aid in reducing and caring for these vulnerable.
Therefore, it is crucial to note that all three discussed articles build on the agreement that individuals diagnosed with PD merit the utmost care to enhance their lives. The three articles concur that PD is a chronic neurodegenerative disease with intricate motor and non-motor symptoms. Moreover, the articles have emphasized the significance of caring for caregivers and the community. The articles also provide insights into how PD individuals and their families could be supported to enhance their existence in the community. A good instance is teaching programs in the community. This creates PD awareness in the community and improves patients’ care knowledge. Although the articles concur on some aspects concerning PD patient care, the second article delves into the relationship between educating the public on PD and the burden of caregiving. The finding showed that with education on PD, patients receive quality care and reduce the burden on the caregivers’ side. All in all, the information gained from these articles teaches the significance and the necessity for PD patients’ care.
This article primarily presents the concept of personalized care management for individuals affected by Parkinson’s Disease (PD). Furthermore, this article acknowledges PD as one of the rising neurodegenerative disorders in the world, affecting more than eight million people globally (Halteren, Munneke, Smit, Thomas, Bloem & Darweesh, 2020). Hence, cooperative care among families, health professionals, and healthcare services is necessary for offering care for these groups of people to make life easier for patients diagnosed with PD. The article has proposed a personalized care management model for these vulnerabilities in making this dream true. According to Hatteren et al. (2020), the model proposed has five elements for aiding PD patients in coping with their condition.
The first is care coordination which could be termed a team-based activity. The element allows sharing of health information among the caregivers hence facilitating a common understanding. The second element in this model is patient navigation, which involves integrated service delivery to guide and support both the caregivers and the patients. The research also found that fragmentation of care among these patients immensely affects the quality of service received. The third element as per the model is information provision data sharing concerning both physical and health details of the PD patients. Teaching PD patients about their condition creates self-awareness and, in turn, results in self-management and active self-decision-making. The fourth element of the model is the early detection of signs and symptoms through proactive monitoring. This involves thorough monitoring of patients suspected of developing PD conditions so that timely intervention can prevent further worsening. Finally, the last element of the personalized care management model is process monitoring. The element mainly involves tracking, reviewing, and evaluating the care management process concerning set plans and goals. The process is essential because it assesses the quality-of-service deliveries and their impact on the PD’s patients.
This is a useful source to start with as far as PD patients are concerned. Reading through this article provides important insights both for caregivers and the family living with individuals diagnosed with PD. For instance, I personally, through reading the article, find it necessary to support families and patients struggling to handle these persons living with PD, and in the future, I am looking forward to helping families and individuals affected
