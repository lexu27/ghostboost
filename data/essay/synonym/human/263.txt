Based on the stipulated fact regarding the story behind numbers, I opine that several financial drivers are behind the story. Firstly, the price change percentage plays a key role as a financial indicator. It implies how prices adjust on a declining basis, inclining basis operating theater a discounted basis. This indicator be instrumental because one cannot maintain sales at the same price. Such attributes are associated with various external agent that act with forces of demand and supply. Secondly, the cost of a good percentage is another vital financial indicator whose influence cannot be ignored. The impact is due to the factors associated with cost (Mack, 2021 ). For instance, the cost is a vital determinant of price; therefore it is mandatory to do be consideration for the price alteration. Finally, account receivable marks are a critical indicator in every organization. It implies the returns from sales recorded since the success of every organization relies majorly on the incontrovertibility of numbers in account receivable, which have crucial importance associated with the same (Hristov & Giorgio de chirico, 2019 ). Talking about a story behind a number, these three indicators go hand in hand with the success of the actual story. Keeping an eye on these indicators calls for intensive insight and analysis of the same. Such consideration will be instrumental in decisional stages and subsequent improvement, enhancing profitable financial decisions.
