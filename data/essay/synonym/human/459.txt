Overcrowding in urban areas has emerged as one of the most crucial issues of our era. This represents both an ecological and a societal issue. The metropolitan area cannot expand endlessly and offer satisfactory employment opportunities for every inhabitant. The environmental load is also on the rise. Unregulated expansion in the quantity of urban areas results in the uncontrolled proliferation of contamination and the rise of destitution. Nonetheless, there exist various preemptive actions that the authorities can enforce to address this matter. Initially, urban overpopulation manifests as congestion and gridlocks, which lead to severe contamination issues. Airborne contamination is most severe in urban areas, with road transportation being the main culprit, discharging substantial amounts of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen into the atmosphere. The second primary concern is destitution: marginalized communities in rural regions live in impoverished conditions (Innes et al., 2019). Some opt to relocate to the city assuming that they can easily secure employment. Their primary objective is to support their families, yet scarce possess the requisite qualifications for a decent occupation. These individuals migrate to the city and end up forming a workforce. They endure discrimination from local inhabitants, poverty, and substandard labor conditions. Another drawback stemming from overcrowding is the waste generated by residents, which poses challenges for disposal (Namberger et al., 2019). In various European nations, this issue is addressed through segregated waste management (even at residences, distinct waste bins are provided). Subsequently, a portion of the waste is recycled, while the rest is incinerated at specialized facilities. To address congestion and atmospheric contamination issues, individuals should utilize public transportation more frequently instead of relying on personal vehicles. The authorities need to construct additional roads and enhance public transportation to tackle this dilemma. Current poverty rates are at historic lows, and all indicators suggest ongoing progress in the battle against destitution in the foreseeable future.
