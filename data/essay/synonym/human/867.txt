The storyline organization in the film Carol is unique because of the emphasis on detailed aspects of storytelling. The primary reason for deviating from conventional narrative forms is grounded in the reality that Carol offers a variety of viewpoints. The movie does not exclusively focus on Carol or Therese but rather seamlessly shifts from one sub-story to another. Both perspectives naturally blend into a unified and engaging narrative abundant in details, feelings, and narrative components.
Primarily, it is crucial to recognize that the film is set in the 1950s, a time when society was notably more traditional and strict, particularly towards the LGBTQ+ community. Nonetheless, "it's the manner in which the unmistakably modern viewpoint of the narrative intersects with traditional style that is significant" (Turan par. 4). Essentially, the contemporary approach of incorporating multiple angles on the storyline alongside classical aesthetics renders the narrative organization distinct and intricate. The film is filmed in a manner that frequently positions viewers as mere spectators of the characters, who express their emotions not through dialogue but through facial expressions, environments, gestures, and musical accompaniments. Another critique suggests that viewers observe "the characters through the windows of a car or house and left them in a hazy focus" (Raynes par. 8). Throughout the film, viewers witness the protagonists sitting or standing behind windows, mirroring a realistic encounter as individuals typically perceive strangers, rather than participating in private discussions.
Secondly, the narrative structure distinguishes itself from conventional methods through meticulous and intimate storytelling. A film critic astutely highlights one of Haynes's remarks, wherein he aimed to create a distinct narrative setup, articulating: "I felt like if we followed a genre very closely, but did it with dolls, and did it very carefully and very lovingly and attentively, it could stimulate emotions in a viewer the way it would if it was actors" (Barr par. 2). Put differently, there is a deliberate endeavor to follow the plotline, gradually shifting from one character to another without abrupt transitions. Consequently, the film's narrative places significant emphasis on non-verbal communication to maintain discussions and interactions as authentic as possible.
Nevertheless, the emotional components and crucial aspects of the characters' dialogues are conveyed through gazes, stares, smiles, and other forms of expression. Within such a narrative framework, the role of a critic is undertaken not by the director, producer, or screenwriter but by the audience, and furthermore, not by an individual viewer but by the collective spectators. If the audience is engrossed by the cinematic portrayal, with emotions and sentiments evoked within them, then the filmmaker has effectively fulfilled the objective. In essence, in the narrative arrangement of Carol, the transmission of significance and substance occurs through the captivating observance of the protagonists.
To summarize, the chosen film's narrative differs from traditional formats due to the utilization of various viewpoints through which characters can be encountered and observed. The transitions from one subplot to another are seamlessly integrated, ensuring the coherence of a unified narrative. The film opts to display rather than explain within its authentic environment without excessive intrusion from the viewer's standpoint.
