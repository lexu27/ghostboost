Preface
Whenever a knowledge void or an unsettled scientific issue surfaces, disinformation is likely to emerge as individuals strive to rationalize, understand better, and link the dots. This has been the scenario with COVID-19 vaccines, which have been received with both gratitude and doubt. Recently, some well-known personalities such as Joe Rogan have encountered difficulties for endorsing deceptive comments about COVID-19 on his program. Rogan, who owns The Joe Rogan Experience, the most renowned podcast globally, sealed a deal with Spotify to exclusively host his material on the streaming platform (Dickson, 2022). With pressure escalating on Spotify to eliminate misinformation on the platform and take resolute action against Rogan, analyzing how the troubled company can sway the public's viewpoint is crucial.
The Joe Rogan Situation
Joe Rogan’s podcast is deemed the most prevalent worldwide, attracting millions of viewers and listeners. According to Rolling Stone, Rogan’s podcast garners approximately 11 million listeners per episode (Dickson, 2022). Undoubtedly, any COVID-19 disinformation stemming from his platform could be disastrous. Spotify encounters a significant challenge because Rogan was permitted to feature Dr. Robert Malone, an anti-vaxxer banned from other platforms like Twitter. Malone propagated anti-vaccination comments throughout the episode, including advancing the narrative that hospitals are financially incentivized to report fictitious COVID-19 fatalities (Dickson, 2022). Rogan is confronting criticism because he appeared to embrace these notions, with additional evidence emerging that he had made racially insensitive comments in numerous of his previous podcasts. Consequently, further steps from Spotify should aim to earn public trust, primarily through effective communication.
Spotify's Stance on the Matter
Spotify does not believe it holds an obligation to monitor content posted on its platform (Holtermann, 2022). This is a careless statement from a public relations standpoint. The company has assured the public that it will affix content advisories on some podcasts. This is a commendable move but should be implemented promptly. Spotify has not ousted Joe Rogan or indicated intentions to probe him. This is a blatant display of irresponsibility and indifference to public safety. Ultimately, Spotify lacks a clear policy to combat false news or misinformation. These missteps from the commencement of the issue have persisted in shaping a negative attitude and public perception about the streaming company. Without a prompt resolution, the company's tribulations may not cease soon.
The Communication Process
The aptitude to converse with one another is a fundamental trait that distinguishes humans from other species. Communication is the capacity to transmit stimuli - typically verbal - to other individuals to alter their behavior (Lecture January 24). The objective of communication often revolves around persuasion for three motives: Shaping, reinforcing, and changing. According to lecture notes, shaping is beneficial in forging a favorable mood (attitudes) or brand identity, changing for influencing behavioral modification, and reinforcing (most frequently employed) for fortifying existing behaviors (Lecture January 24). Hence, the company should integrate all three strategies to address its issues effectively.
Communication and Action for Persuasion
Spotify executives are under pressure to address COVID-19 misinformation disseminated on the platform. In response, the company has contended that it has no duty to combat the misleading information on the ongoing pandemic. Regrettably, the public and various leaders have not welcomed this stance. Consequently, some musicians have withdrawn their content from the platform, and many others are contemplating the same action (Holtermann, 2022). Many users also indicate they plan to substitute Spotify with alternative streaming companies. This underscores the urgency of deescalating the situation. Spotify can commence by employing three rhetorical components to change, shape, and reinforce public opinion. These encompass ethos, pathos, and logos, as advocated by Aristotle.
Ethos
According to Aristotle, ethos addresses the audience's ethical standing. Spotify has not openly acknowledged that Rogan's show violated its moral policy. It has surfaced that the company lacks a policy governing fake news on its platform (Dickson, 2022). This must change, and Spotify must initiate appealing to the public's moral comprehension. As Spotify looks to enhance its policy on misinformation, it should come out openly and denounce Rogan's comments as unethical. This will indicate that the company upholds a moral standpoint. More crucially, Spotify must reshape its organizational culture to embrace answerability. The image Spotify currently portrays is one of lacking answerability, which is exceedingly unethical.
Pathos
Pathos pertains to a communicator's appeal to the audience's emotions. Spotify's actions have demonstrated a lack of empathy for individuals who have succumbed to COVID-19, including healthcare professionals toiling tirelessly to combat the virus. The pandemic has brought about a protracted period of suffering globally, and a sizable corporation like Spotify should empathize with those impacted. Many individuals anticipated Spotify to condemn Malone following his derogatory remarks towards healthcare professionals on Rogan's show, but this did not occur. Hence, Spotify should issue an apology statement to healthcare workers to demonstrate the company's support and comprehension for their ceaseless sacrifices during this pandemic.
Logos
Logos entails employing rational arguments to appeal to the audience. This can encompass the use of facts and figures to bolster the argument. Spotify has yielded to public pressure and removed some of Rogan's podcasts from its platform. Nonetheless, this might not suffice as the public anticipates Spotify to undertake more. Numerous argue that Spotify has not taken stringent action against Rogan due to his influence and the million-dollar deal he sealed with the company. Consequently, the company should dismiss Rogan indefinitely pending an investigation into his conduct. It must eliminate all content related to disseminating COVID-19 misinformation from the site. This measure should be extended to users exploiting the platform's lax misinformation policy.
Additional Strategies
Spotify needs to demonstrate that its operations align with fundamental corporate social responsibility guidelines. Spotify should delineate clear strategies it intends to employ to combat misinformation. This should encompass an intention to train employees on effective content moderation and recruit additional staff to augment its content moderation capacity. More importantly, the company must announce its commitment to formulating or investing in a robust artificial intelligence system to monitor content and flag inappropriate ones before they reach the public domain. Such actions would reinforce people's trust that Spotify is rectifying its error.
Conclusion
In essence, Joe Rogan has placed Spotify in a delicate situation. The company risks exacerbating its reputation further if it fails to address the issue effectively. This could also result in substantial revenue losses from streams if numerous users follow through on their threat to abandon the platform. Simultaneously, Rogan plays a pivotal role on the platform as his podcast entices millions of listeners globally. Notably, his podcast currently leads globally in terms of followers and revenue. Despite these impressive statistics, Spotify, akin to any other company, bears a social responsibility to ensure its presence does not imperil public welfare. Given that this has transpired, Spotify must act swiftly and reassure the public of its ethical and legal obligations. It can accomplish this by implementing the persuasion strategies expounded in this presentation.
