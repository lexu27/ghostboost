Emily Dickinson’s 1865 poem A narrow Fellow in the Grass complies with the dread of deceit. The visual representations are employed to introduce dread or unease through a serpent. It commences with a lean gentleman that roams through the Grass. The writer guides the readers into the poetic journey of exploring fearing the unfamiliar. Whenever an individual dreads the unfamiliar, they are susceptible to falling prey to deceit. The encounter with a serpent delineates the orientation of deceit because they are erratic. In the poem, the serpent emerges and vanishes without issuing any caution. The writer utilizes this characteristic of environmental alterations to bring forth the essence of anxiety and dread. The poem analytically centers on the reality of dread versus the idealism of deceit, which symbolizes nature and humanity.
The writer personifies the serpent by dubbing it a fellow, which imparts the serpent an odd human-like trait. When it is referred to as a fellow, it indicates that the serpent harbors thoughts that can manifest into intentions (line 1). The perception of threat appears archetypal. It encapsulates the presumed encounter that the writer endorses the notion that there is a larger issue than the fundamental analogy of serpents being frightening. The emblematic essence of the serpent is fear and deceit, which many individuals can apply in their situations. Ancient serpent symbolism, such as in the Garden of Eden, is deceit or trickery.
The orator employs flashbacks to relate to his juvenile encounter with the serpent. According to the orator, he was duped into touching a serpent (line 12). The serpent’s capability to camouflage itself intimidates everyone into adhering to its deceits. For instance, the writer reminisces about his childhood recollection when he believed the serpent was a Whip Lash. He stooped to collect it, but the serpent coiled and vanished (line 13). The element of fear arises when the serpent refrains from biting the orator, but it conceals and disappears. Fear instills apprehensive expectation that renders an individual uncertain about what is about to transpire.
The poem revolves around inviting and aggressive, amiable and threatening, peculiar and familiar. The orator’s response toward the serpent demonstrates that it is a conventional reaction in the natural realm. Humans are a component of the world as creatures, and the poem’s topic adheres to the truth of existence and demise. For example, in the first stanza, the orator treats the serpent as a cultured member through personification. There exists a correlation between the human-like realm and animal nature. The interaction between the orator and the serpent reveals fragility when he asserts that he encountered the serpent while he was a lad. He was shoeless during that period, rendering him unprotected against the natural world. The spectrum analogy also implies that individuals and nature share a link that can transform into a hazard if underestimated.
The ultimate stanza designates the serpent as an unfamiliar menace lurking in the tranquil realm. According to the poet, transport/ Of Cordiality refers to the bonds of kinship among animals. The diction used contrasts the treacherous image of the serpent, showcasing concord within the Garden of Eden. There is a genial stance with the serpent, and the threatening relationship is displayed by the fact that a serpent holds physical dominance over the writer. The idealism of animal rapport with the reality of nature suggests that humans can detach from the animal world, but they are not impervious to the hazards of ecology.
