Preamble
From the viewpoint of business bookkeeping, risk management entails the appraisal, assessment, and alleviation of risk within the operations of an organization. Generally, risk management is perceived as a strategic management notion, but within the framework of contemporary businesses, accounting plays a significant role and is deeply committed to risk avoidance. Enterprise risk management should be fundamental to a professional accounting mentality, and to bring value, accountants must be outward-looking risk specialists that provide insight for their organizations when pursuing their goals or addressing uncertainty. Financial and accounting functions deliver crucial quality information to management promptly that can be utilized by managers at all tiers for well-informed decision-making (Camilleri & Camilleri, 2017). Accounting serves as an instrument for success, collaborating with operational management to make favorable decisions, undertake evaluated risks, and realize enterprise strategic objectives.

Explanation
Risk management is an all-encompassing process of recognizing, scrutinizing, and mitigating/embracing the risk of uncertainty. Risk is measurable in both absolute and relative terms and eventually becomes inseparable from return on investment. Despite risk being perceived in adverse terms, it is imperative for accomplishing performance objectives. In its fundamental form in accounting, the risk represents a deviation from the anticipated outcome (Camilleri & Camilleri, 2017). The deviation can be positive or negative, but it is widely acknowledged by financial experts that escalated returns come with increased risk and, in turn, arise from heightened volatility. Accountants consistently seek ways to diminish volatility and risk by employing various metrics such as standard deviation, distributions, and dispersions. Risk assessment is a key element of internal control in organizations, recognizing areas of risk exposure via accounting records and enforcing suitable controls (Needles et al., 2014). Assessing risk statistically and numerically allows for highly informed decision-making concerning existing or potential risks.

Risk has conventionally been characterized in terms of the likelihood of peril, loss, injury, or other unfavorable outcomes. In accounting, risk is considered from the standpoint of decision trees, probability distributions, cost-volume-profit analysis, pricing models, cash flow models, and numerous other frameworks. Risk management enables one to methodically address risk, immediately linking it to organizational activities and pursuing organizational objectives. Efficient risk management encompasses assessment, evaluation, treatment, and reporting. Meanwhile, the more comprehensive enterprise risk management strategy aims at harmonizing risk management with a business strategy and integrating a management ethos into business operations (Collier et al., 2006).

Varieties of Risk
Risk is categorized into divisions allowing for more effective and efficient comparison and evaluation. Risk will persist to a certain extent, so accountants must grasp that some level of risk is acceptable, but tradeoffs and opportunity costs must be weighed to either eradicate or uphold certain risks. Hence, it might be beneficial to classify risks, but different institutions may approach this differently.
1. Market risk – fluctuating conditions in the marketplace where the organization operates, encompassing general market trends to specific company-specific features.
2. Credit risk – emanating from the risk linked with credit extended to customers and/or suppliers, with the danger that either party may default. The company must also ensure that it fulfills its own credit obligations promptly.
3. Liquidity risk – this can involve asset liquidity and operational funding liquidity. The company must have cash readily available to cover basic expenses, balancing its assets and operational funding.
4. Operational risk – risk stemming from routine business operations, spanning from crises and lawsuits to fraud and business models (Camilleri & Camilleri, 2017).

Function of Accountants
Accountants play a crucial role in supporting organizations with internal controls and risk management procedures. It is a fundamental skill of accountancy as a profession to supervise and enhance internal control frameworks in an organization. They guarantee that staff members are knowledgeable about risk control terminology and standards, which must be adhered to in all financial operations. Accountants essentially establish the standards and then enforce them in an organization (Needles et al., 2014). In a sense, accountants are pivotal strategic partners in decision-making management in risk management and consideration.

Accountants are most effective at risk management when they possess an understanding of enterprise risk management (ERM) and applications of daily business operations. Companies with ERM strategies in place typically excel in risk management and can concentrate on business continuity. A notable portion of companies reacts to risks after they emerge rather than proactively, and risk management is best approached proactively before any contingency arises. To execute this competently, companies require accounting staff who can gauge and manage risks accurately in all their manifestations. However, for ERM to be effective, it must be directly linked to company strategy and actions. Accountants have direct insight into a company’s finances and supply chains, thus they collaborate cross-functionally with other departments, such as H.R., I.T., sustainability, and others, to essentially evaluate financial and non-financial risks across the organization to formulate a comprehensive risk framework (Thompson, 2020).

Effect on Accounting Quality
ERM garnered considerable attention and prominence amid the 2008 crisis. It is believed to enhance a company’s capacity to mitigate the impact of a major economic crisis as well as lead to an improved value relevance of account information for firms adopting ERM. Accounting quality is not explicitly defined but generally implies that the value relevance of accounting information is taken into account and the capability of accounting information to reflect the true performance of an organization. Some common attributes highlighted as crucial to accounting quality are timeliness and timely loss recognition, accrual quality, earnings management, and discretionary accruals (Olayinka et al., 2019).

Accounting quality enables firms to curtail earnings management, minimize discretionary accruals, and provide valuable information on earnings. It is a critical gauge of the value relevance of accounting for an organization seeking sustainable growth. ERM gained global popularity because it aims to enhance the accuracy of corporate disclosure, elevate the reliability of financial statements, cultivate robust risk management, and boost accounting quality. Consequently, accounting is intricately linked with risk management and prevention within such systems. Accounting is indispensable for ERM functionality, while ERM endeavors to refine accounting processes by enhancing financial reporting quality and fortifying the internal processes of an organization (Olayinka et al., 2019).

Risk Management and Corporate Governance
Competent corporate governance results from an effective risk management system that establishes a controlled environment. This is why much recent legislation worldwide, including the Dodd-Frank Act in the U.S. following the 2008 financial crisis, mandates effective risk management implementation in firms. Management accounting, under the auspices of risk and governance, needs to be operationally viable for their role and competence to be interpretable in rational and predictable terms. While risk management forms the bedrock of modern management control, management accounting significantly influences corporate governance. For instance, failure to provide accurate accounting reports and then utilize these reports effectively in risk management will adversely impact corporate governance. There exists an inherent interdependence among risk management, managerial accounting, and corporate governance (Van der Poll & Mthiyane, 2018).

The formulation and deployment of strategic management accounting techniques hinge on strategic information gathering to address environmental uncertainties to support strategic decision-making. As a part of the organizational structure, it falls upon the board as a component of corporate governance to formulate a successful strategy, with managerial accounting reports facilitating this endeavor. Strategic management accounting serves as the foundation for strategic
