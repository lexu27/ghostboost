Faith is one of the most notable components for migrant groups. Spiritual convictions and ceremonies bond individuals with shared origins in the United States. The faith of the Jamaica West Indies population is the selected cultural aspect to analyze. The Jamaica West Indies, as per the interviewee, follow Methodist and Anglican customs which are divisions of Christianity ( Methodist vs Anglican, n.d). These two paths are more interlinked with each other than with other Christian religious customs. Methodism is more prevalent as it emphasizes spiritual practices more, while the Anglican Church is more ceremonial. Jamaica West Indies migrants additionally introduce aspects of their culture into the Christian religious practices, which is evident in the inclusion of music into worship, a departure from the original denominations.

In the homeland of the interviewee, the Methodist and Anglican customs are exceedingly prevalent. It is observed that over 60% of the populace in the country adheres to the Christian faith, while others follow local sects, such as Rastafarianism ( Faith, n.d). The historical origins of the Christian belief in Jamaica stem from Europe and, alongside the Methodist and Anglican congregations, there are "Roman Catholic, Baptist, Presbyterian, Pentecostal, Seventh Day Adventist, Moravian" churches ( Faith, n.d). It is also significant that the island has more churches per square kilometer than any other nation. This fact underscores the importance of the Christian faith in its diverse forms for the native populace ( Faith, n.d). Furthermore, several educational establishments in Jamaica, as well as charitable groups, are managed by the Christian Church ( Faith, n.d). There are official Christian religious celebrations in Jamaica, with four of them linked to church services. Hence, even though the Methodist and Anglican churches are not mainstream, they are practiced alongside other Christian sects.

Jamaica West Indies US migrantsâ€™ faith does not differ significantly from native customs on the island. Diamant (2021) in the Pew Research Center material notes that presently, Black migrants to the US follow Christianity to a larger extent. In contrast, US-born Blacks predominantly adhere to the Protestant faith (Diamant, 2021). Many of them frequent existing churches of various denominations including Methodist and Anglican. Furthermore, some migrants attend gatherings that are devoted to specific Christian branches and provide distinct religious rituals. Generally, it is typical for Jamaica West Indies to visit congregations that embody the traits and features of Caribbean churches.

The faith of Jamaican migrants in the US has undergone some alterations that demonstrate transculturalism. A significant aspect of the Jamaican religious heritage is the "integration of music and praise and worship" (Beacom, n.d). Mainly drums and trombones are utilized, and in West Indies churches, music is employed to establish the tempo for the entire service. Consequently, migrant groups now blend conventional Christian variations of Methodist and Anglican inclinations with indigenous characteristics. The integration of music and musical instruments into worship is one of the most noticeable attributes of Jamaica West Indies religious customs. This adaptation highlights the necessity for migrant groups in congregations that possess a set of distinct characteristics.

Hence, the religious customs of the Jamaica West Indies exhibit similarities both in the United States and in Jamaica. Jamaica is a nation where Christianity in all its forms is highly prevalent, making religious practices quite customary for this group in the United States. Nevertheless, despite following Methodism, Jamaica West Indies introduced a unique aspect to their worship by incorporating musical instruments. Jamaica West Indies bands apply music to establish the rhythm for religious services, setting their practice apart from traditional denominations.
