I desire to express gratitude to my offspring that my work is not forgotten. This tale of everlasting affection is likely applicable in your times, hence there exist numerous movie adaptations and renditions of ‘Romeo and Juliet’. The recent interpretation of my drama generally left a debatable impact: the performers seem appropriate for their parts, but the underlying theme of the drama appears to be not as deeply grasped.

Carlo Carlea’s ‘Romeo and Juliet’ (2013) was shot on ancient locations and estates in various Italian cities with minimal historical inaccuracies. The portrayal of some roles is commendable: Hayley Steinfeld reminds us that Juliet was a juvenile by contemporary standards, not yet a woman. Some of the sequences have been altered to make the narrative more understandable for the younger audience. The specifics have been modified, and the dialogues have been trimmed to sustain the intense emotional pitch that present-day viewers expect. From the beginning of the movie, it is evident that the opening statement has been altered. Romeo lacks any hint of ardor or romance, although he appears marginally more manly in terms of demeanor, voice, and combat skills than in prior versions. I question whether the director and producers comprehended the timeless subjects of the drama.

They crafted a movie that, I believe, encompasses humanity’s greatest frailties and virtues concerning both affection and desire. Nevertheless, once the characters commence behaving drastically dissimilarly, with conversations randomly inserted and subjects disregarded or mishandled, it stops being an interpretation and transforms into a mockery. The adaptation appears to fall short of the challenges presented in the original drama.
