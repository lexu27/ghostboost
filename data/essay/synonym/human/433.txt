From ancient times, humans have utilized symbols and legends to convey their understanding of a reality that surpasses the physical realm and passes it on to future generations. In the present day, renowned brands employ mythology for successful products because of their enchanting influence. The emblem of the Versace mansion is an exceedingly lavish and remarkable symbol; it was crafted in 1978 by Gianni Versace. The symbol depicts the visage of the ancient Greek legend of Medusa Gorgon. The creator clarified why he selected this figure; it is a blend of loveliness and minimalism, which is capable of captivating anyone, much like the garments manufactured by the label. Additional instances include Lamborghini; initially, the Italian corporation was involved in the manufacturing of tractors. The bull became the insignia of the brand, as the bull is the revered creature of Zeus. As per certain individuals, this creature is incredibly robust and sturdy, which imparts immense strength to the brand. Nowadays, Lamborghini vehicles are high-performance, pricey supercars, and the insignia of the golden bull is exceedingly fitting for them.

I favor the fable of Prometheus because malevolence never prevails, and virtue and fairness triumph. The powerful titan Prometheus filched the holy flame from Olympus to bestow it upon humankind. He rendered humanity autonomous from the deities. Prometheus educated individuals to scribble, calculate, handicrafts, and introduced them to metals. Previously, people dreaded the sea elements, but now the titan educated them on how to construct vessels; humans acquired skillfulness in the field of medicine (Travis, 2021). Prometheus was undermining people's trust in the divinity, and as a consequence, the thunderer Zeus resolved to penalize him. Prometheus was fastened to a boulder, the scorching sun tormented him relentlessly, and the rain lashed upon him. Nonetheless, this was not the finale of the titan's anguish; a colossal eagle perched on Prometheus's torso daily and ripped his liver (Travis, 2021). Heracles, the mightiest of men, exterminated the eagle that tormented Prometheus, shattered Prometheus' fetters, and the titan was liberated.
