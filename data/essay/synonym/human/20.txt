The establishment of a web-based system to store the university’s data on students and their transcripts introduces specific hazards that must be tackled in the feasibility report. By utilizing the traditional risk assessment procedure, it is feasible to classify the hazards into two main categories. These include hazards to the continuation and fulfillment of the project and hazards to the end product’s efficiency after the project’s completion.
The hazards to the continuation and fulfillment of the project are as follows:
  * Unforeseen delays and time expenditures. There is a chance that the project’s execution will be more intricate than expected, necessitating additional time;
  * Individuals participating in the project might fall ill and decelerate production;
  * The accessible hardware and software may malfunction.
The hazards for the efficiency of the end product are as follows:
  * The product might not be sufficiently secure to handle personal student data;
  * The product would be economically impractical to operate;
  * The product would not function adequately according to the university’s requirements.
Time-related issues could be identified by comparing the progress made with the schedule formulated before commencing the project. Functionality and requirements hazards can be unearthed by aligning the product with its stipulations, as well as through testing at specific project milestones. Possible time constraints and personnel/hardware failures can be accommodated by allocating more time to the project than initially calculated to enable replacements to be executed. Combating the hazards linked to site performance would be more challenging and primarily possess a reactive character, in case some of them are not detected and rectified during the product testing phase.
