Family connections are becoming increasingly important in the contemporary world. This unit of society has the chance to establish the most favorable conditions for future generations. Therefore, it is crucial to explore and discover methods to resolve issues, challenges, and conflicts between spouses. This is also crucial due to the fact that even currently, the decline of family bonds will adversely impact not just society but also the mental and physical well-being of individuals (Salinger and Whisman, 2021). Presently, the Western model of marital relationships is widespread, where the connection is built on friendliness and considering the individual's character as the most significant indicator. It is essential to highlight that the bond between partners is a direct reflection of the trends in society's progress. This is because social circumstances are consistently changing and evolving, presenting new demands to the family institution. Consequently, recently, the roles of husband and wife have been shifting in importance. There are frequent instances where a woman becomes the provider for the family and shoulders all responsibilities, assuming a leadership role. However, an essential aspect of the union of men and women is adhering to religious beliefs. Additionally, faith underscores upholding traditional ideological principles. The way individuals will embrace faith can be transmitted to future generations, which can have both a positive and non-positive nature. Hence, it is crucial to raise children considering religion based on mutual understanding, affection, and empathy.
Despite its rapid progression, modern society is marked by a sufficient number of social issues. The necessity to address them is to enhance individuals' relationships for the betterment of future generations. Therefore, one of the key issues is the examination of marital relationships and the challenges that may arise within them. It should be emphasized that, in this context, the significance of religion and its principles plays a pivotal role. Thus, this study delves into the difficulties of matrimony, the strategies to resolve them, and the utilization of faith for a more profound comprehension of the issue.
Hence, an increasing amount of literature and scholarly works are emerging on the subject of the bond between husband and wife. Furthermore, particular focus is placed on their impact on social life and the mental and physical well-being of the partners (Masoumi et al., 2017). The family, as a societal institution, holds a central position, therefore attracting heightened interest from researchers in various disciplines. Similarly, this aspect draws religion into its framework, as it can serve as both a unifying force for spouses and a source of discord. Nonetheless, most studies demonstrate the positive influence of faith on these types of relationships.
For these reasons, a comprehensive understanding of marital relationships is necessary, characterized by ongoing changes over time. It is also influenced by external factors such as modernization and globalization. To a greater degree, they have impacted the evolution of the concept of a companionate marriage, which embodies features of a collaborative relationship where both parties consciously approach resolving numerous issues and comprehending ongoing situations. However, even in this scenario, negative and stressful circumstances may arise, necessitating prompt solutions and a rational approach (Masoumi et al., 2017). Furthermore, such healthy relationships are defined by a high level of intimacy between spouses, a unique degree of fondness, mutual understanding, and empathy.
The advancement of technology and shifts in social values have a distinct impact on the institution of marriage. Thus, in contemporary society, there exists the nuclear family model, where the man is involved in providing for the family's material needs, while the woman is primarily engaged in maintaining the home and caring for children. Nonetheless, there are instances where these roles are reversed, and the woman takes on the financial responsibilities while the man handles domestic affairs. Additionally, the Western family model is becoming prevalent worldwide, emphasizing amicable relations initially, followed by romantic ones.
Consequently, the modern Western family model prioritizes the individuality of the partners rather than the economic or status aspect. In contrast to past practices, individuals nowadays primarily select their life partners based on specific traits, and then consider their wealth and social standing. Moreover, the generation gap is widening, complicating relationships between, for instance, children and parents. This is attributed to the shift in the pace of personal growth and establishment. Family values and behavioral patterns are also evolving, necessitating adaptation, which may lead to disagreements and challenges. The primary authority in the family is not always the male provider, which also exerts its unique influence.
A stable and fulfilling marriage can serve as a valuable source of emotional and practical support throughout adulthood. Furthermore, it is linked to enhanced financial well-being, as well as mental and physical health (Rajabi et al., 2020). Some of these evident benefits of marriage may stem from improved health habits among married individuals, care and oversight by a spouse, or, primarily, selecting the healthiest, happiest, and financially stable men and women for stable marriages. Although the precise nature of the processes leading to these positive outcomes is not entirely clear, marriage is associated with significant advantages for older Americans.
It is important to note that intimate spousal relationships are founded on emotional backing and confidence. These aspects contribute to the concept of a healthy marriage. Divergent interests within a couple can also facilitate bonding. Even in the presence of differences, the key is to relish each other's companionship. Moreover, a healthy relationship between husband and wife serves as a means of well-being, enabling effective management of emerging stressors. While conflict situations and challenges persist, they can be resolved more swiftly and occur less frequently. Furthermore, when addressing various issues, spouses become more unified and can provide greater benefits to society.
Therefore, as previously mentioned, stressful circumstances are unavoidable, and finding solutions can sometimes be quite challenging. One such problem may revolve around the financial aspect of establishing and sustaining a family. This issue is frequently raised in literature and might have one of the most detrimental impacts. It is observed that financial disagreements often mask the desire for control over the societal unit. Additionally, differences in views regarding family structure and values that one spouse has developed during their formative years can lead to difficulties, negatively impacting the mental well-being of the husband or wife.
Another issue pertains to everything related to childbirth and child-rearing. These family members typically contribute to heightened tension within the family, especially during the stages of preparing for parenthood and in the initial phases of caring for offspring. Conversely, children in family dynamics can significantly influence cohesion, enhance their responsibilities, and foster care (Mahoney et al., 2021). Nevertheless, with the emergence of new family dynamics, spouses tend to pay less attention to each other, leading to conflicts and disputes.
Everyday stress in routine life also plays a role. While it may seem trivial at times, over time, tension can accumulate and escalate into significant conflicts. Under such circumstances, detecting the irritable or despondent state of one's partner is crucial. This can aid in managing stress and averting potential consequences. Effective stress management fosters the development of skills in emotional support, which can prove beneficial in potential instances of recurrence.
A prevalent issue is the lack of time, often stemming from various factors, but most frequently due to one spouse's work schedule. This scenario affects not only the mental but also the physical well-being of the spouses. A husband and wife may feel distant and disconnected from their previously strong bond. Consequently, communication issues may arise, disrupting the family institution's dynamics. Assessing spouses
