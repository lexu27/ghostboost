Panama is an evolving nation with a rapidly expanding economy situated in Central America. It possesses one of the highest Gross Domestic Products in Latin America but is not without internal economic issues, such as income disparity and destitution. This article aims to examine two recent news pieces concerning Panama, which highlight the problem of the elevated joblessness rate in this nation, which is on the rise and has evolved into a critical situation.
The initial article was featured in a Panama news source named Newsroom Panama. It discloses that in 2021, 108,975 individuals in Panama were seeking employment, and the jobless rates were higher among women compared to men (Newsroom Panama, 2022). Unemployment stems from a scarcity of new positions, and the administration must provide subsidies to its residents to assist them in surviving (Newsroom Panama, 2022). This article aligns with my discoveries that, despite rapid economic advancement, Panama has been encountering escalating unemployment rates in recent times.
The second article was released in Valley Post and is titled “Job Creation is a Challenge for Panama.” It reveals that the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted jobs in the tourism, retail, real estate, and construction industries in Panama (Arzu, 2022). This reference corresponds with my findings that the majority of the populace in Panama is engaged in the service sector. When the primary economic fields are unable to function as usual, the nation undergoes a surge in unemployment.
To summarize, Panama is an export-driven nation, and services form the cornerstone of its economy. Despite the economic growth, this progress is imperceptible to its citizens, many of whom struggle to secure a formal full-time position. To tackle this dilemma, the nation must enhance the skills of its workforce and generate fresh job opportunities, for instance, by investing in infrastructure.
