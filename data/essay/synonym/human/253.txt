Sterile products for patient care rely on the efficiency of sterilization and the unit layout. Central processing aims to handle medical and surgical equipment in an orderly way. They are also tailored to protect patients from infection while minimizing risks to workers and maintaining the value of the items being reused. Sterile processing facilities vary in size and complexity from large, highly advanced production settings that recycle numerous instrument combinations and devices to small, specialized facilities that recycle a limited quantity and variety of instruments (Swanson 245). In certain cases, sterile processing may occur entirely on-site where the equipment is used; alternatively, small remote clean production plants may be incorporated within or beside a surgical suite's semi-restricted area. Regardless of the location or type of reprocessing procedures carried out in these areas, the basic operational principles and workflow remain consistent.

If someone is considering the design of their perfect kitchen, design is bound to have a significant impact. This might involve placing the dishwasher next to the sink for quicker loading, locating the pull-out trash in a food preparation area, or installing functional drawers to store items that might otherwise clutter the counter. The point is that design is crucial. It is essential that the Sterile Processing Department (SPD), where surgical instruments are processed and reprocessed daily, adhere to industry standards set by organizations. These organizations include the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI), the National Association of periOperative Nursing (APON), and the American Society for Quality (ASQ) (Neue). An SPD department is necessary whether you are treating patients at a teaching hospital or an outpatient surgical center. The placement of an SPD department is critical in establishing a workflow that allows an SPD department to efficiently turnover, handle, and provide instruments.

Before planning an SPD environment, it is advisable to acquaint yourself with industry standards issued by associations like AAMI and AORN. They can assist with everything from the room's layout to the amount of light and water needed in the space. An SPD should have a clear separation of dirty, clean, and sterilized tools with physical barriers, regardless of the size of your SPD (See fig. 1). Having a process that is as predictable as possible can be advantageous.

The design of a sterile processing space is based on a dirty-to-clean workflow. Moving items from a contaminated to a decontaminated state requires a one-way flow arrangement for instruments and equipment. This one-way movement is crucial in preventing cross-contamination as items go through the process. Air circulation systems are designed to control contaminants. In dirty areas, negative airflow is used compared to clean spaces, while positive airflow protects clean work areas. Several processes are involved in cleaning specialized devices, making these operations error-prone even if they appear simple. Complete separation between dirty and clean areas, proper ventilation, and the equipment necessary to support the optimal workflow are all essential in a sterile processing room. This is in line with the FGI Health Guidelines Revision Committee's goal to "provide healing environments for patients and staff wherever services are provided" (Damien, 229). Reprocessing practices are crucial for preventing healthcare-associated infections, thus patient safety is supported by the revised requirements.

Instruments and devices that can be reused must be disinfected or sterilized before being reprocessed as high-level disinfected or sterilized. The Spaulding classification method categorizes items as semicritical or critical based on whether they require high-level disinfection or sterilization. A "sterile" product has been sterilized to eliminate all microbial life (Ninomura). Sterilized items are considered sterile only when all specified conditions for confirming the sterilization process have been met. Sterile items are handled and stored in a manner that does not compromise their sterility. The "event-related sterility maintenance" criteria determine whether the sterility of stored sterile items has been maintained.

Cleaning removes bioburden (live microorganisms left on a device's surface after use). Residual bioburden can transmit microbes or infections to the next patient using the device. Unclean instruments cannot be sterilized or adequately high-level disinfected; therefore, the effectiveness of any sterilization or high-level disinfection method depends on consistent protocols for removing or significantly reducing bioburden before processing. After cleaning, disinfecting instruments (William), cleaning via chemical (disinfectant) or thermal (washer-decontaminator) means disinfecting devices to make them safe for handling while processing continues. Inspected and packed for sterilization after decontamination, high-level disinfected items are reprocessed without wrapping and must be dried before storage (see fig.2).

To grasp the changes in sterile processing facility requirements in the 2018 FGI Guidelines (Stanton), it is first necessary to understand the history of sterile processing in the operating room. In 2010 and previous editions, the Guidelines mandated one "sub sterile" room with a sink and a thermal sterilizer between every two operating rooms. Unwrapped tools were subjected to a shortened sterilization cycle so they could be reused immediately in a process known as flash sterilization. The instruments were brought into the operating room wet in an open pan after being hand-washed and flash-sterilized. This activity targeted one or two specific instruments or those accidentally contaminated during a procedure. Overuse of sterilization for convenience or as an alternative to obtaining different instrument sets emerged as sterilization methods advanced. Concerns also arose about the increasing size and complexity of flash-sterilized instrument sets and the ability to maintain the sterility of instruments transported wet in an open pan.

Traditional flash sterilization was eventually deemed unacceptable due to these concerns. By using a strategy that combines social media, advertising, and traditional media outreach, it is possible to enhance the visibility of your website. The committee stated that the term flash sterilization was outdated and replaced it with Immediate Use Steam Sterilization (IUSS). Substerile rooms were no longer required in the 2010 FGI Guidelines, but the design criteria were retained for use when a project's functional program demanded them. Items intended for use in the operating room were traditionally referred to be "flash sterilized" in medical terminology (Salabasheva). During flash or emergent sterilization, a sterilization cycle typically lasted between three and ten minutes with little or no drying time or cooling phase, making the sterilization cycle faster than that needed for wrapped or terminally sterilized products.

Open baskets were used in steam sterilizer chambers for flash sterilization, placing the target object in the sterilizer while still wet. When the room door was opened, the sterilized items were exposed to the external environment and could be contaminated due to improper handling. To address this, multiple steam sterilizers were typically placed around the operating suite, usually one between every two operating rooms, to keep the sterilizer as close as possible to the operating room.

In addressing concerns about having only one sterile processing center, the infection facilities on-site in the 2018 HGRC and other domain experts revisited this requirement. They sought to ensure that the design of sterile production plants encourages clinical staff to adhere to professional standards and guidelines for cleaning, disinfecting, and sterilizing surgical equipment (Paul,48). When it came to sterile processing facilities, they considered the dirty-to-clean workflow. They found that two rooms were the minimum requirement: a decontamination chamber and a clean
