Extremism is one of the primary issues encountered by humanity in the 21st century and, in spite of significant countermeasures, it remains relevant. Islamic extremism is one of the most notable forms of the radicalism of the prior decades, which materialized in several tragic incidents. The movement commenced when Osama Bin Laden established al Qaeda in 1989, which executed its initial assault in Yemen by planting an explosive device in a hotel accommodating American troops (“Osama bin Laden,” 2020). Osama Bin Laden advocated for the concept of worldwide Jihad, a sacred war of Muslims against the unbelievers and particularly the United States. The principal extremist act of al Qaeda was the 9/11 Bombing of the World Trade Centers, resulting in the loss of lives of thousands of individuals and initiating the commencement of the War on Terror (“Osama bin Laden,” 2020). Ultimately, the United States Military located Osama bin Laden and eliminated him, yet it did not prevent other Islamic extremists from perpetrating assaults. One of them was the Boston Marathon Bombings incident which were orchestrated by adherents of Osama bin Laden (Breuninger, 2021).
The ongoing extremist assaults provoke numerous worries regarding the efficacy of the United States War on Terror. However, it is still one of the duties of the nation to function as the world’s “policeman” since the United States is the sole global superpower capable of asserting authority abroad. Essentially, by ensuring its military presence in troublesome areas, the United States succeeds in constraining the existing threats to global peace. The Middle East is one such area, and its stability is crucial to the U.S. economy and national security. The United States suppresses the influence and expansion of radical movements in the area, which, if unimpeded, can persist in developing support networks worldwide, including within the United States. Such a progression can result in new extremist assaults, as well as the ascension of Islamist administrations in the Middle East, which will be antagonistic to western nations. Consequently, the extremist menace in the world would only escalate if the United States wholly departed from the Middle East. In such a scenario, local extremist groups would seize authority and acquire more assets enabling them to further instigate violence and devastation. Furthermore, there is also a hazard of Islamist groups taking charge of nuclear weapons, thus imperiling the safety of the entire world.
