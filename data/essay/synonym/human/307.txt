"Young Goodman Brown" was penned by Nathaniel Hawthorne in 1835, but it was situated in Puritan New England during the delayed 17th century. The Puritans divided from England’s Anglican Church, arriving at Plymouth Rock and establishing both Plymouth and Boston. They became the primary Christian sect in New England at the time, though other Christian groups such as Quakers and Anabaptists also had substantial populations. Puritans believed in a strict philosophy that left no room for error; for instance, immoral thoughts and dreams were perceived to be as harmful as actually committing a sin. Indigenous Americans who did not adhere to Christianity were also believed to be Satan’s offspring, according to them. "Young Goodman Brown" is set during the Salem Witch Trials in Massachusetts and reveals the Salem Puritans’ hypocritical and restrictive moral principles.
