Recent trend diets have proposed that carbohydrates cause damage to one’s body. However, this assertion has been contradicted multiple times for various reasons. Firstly, to achieve an attractive, effectively operating body, one requires nutrients – fats, proteins, carbohydrates, and water (Nazario). Carbohydrate metabolism changes carbs into crucial energy for the nervous system and brain, as well as for the chance of proper metabolism of proteins and fats. Once these components are removed, there is a high risk of developing continuous fatigue, which could potentially result in a depressed mood. Secondly, abandoning carbohydrates results in extra pounds because following a carb-free diet, the body is sensitive to every gram of carbohydrates, and overcompensation occurs in the diet. Along with an increased craving for carbohydrate-rich foods, the absorption of this component significantly rises (Nazario). For instance, an individual followed such a regimen for a month and shed ten pounds, then promptly reverted to a regular diet, regaining the same weight within a week. Thirdly, even after the initial day of forgoing carbohydrates, a person might experience a slight discomfort and headache (Nazario). Subsequently, there is a possibility of experiencing persistent headaches leading to migraines. Ultimately, carbohydrates are the main source of energy for the brain. All cognitive functions gradually diminish when the primary “engine” stops receiving adequate charge. Nearly every task requires heightened brain function that is fueled by carbs (Nazario). When an individual abstains from them, primarily the level of focus diminishes. Consistent burning of ketones instead of glucose can result in impaired brain function. Therefore, it is crucial to incorporate carbs into one’s diet to ensure that all bodily systems function correctly.
