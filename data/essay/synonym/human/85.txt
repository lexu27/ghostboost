Preamble
Cultivating leadership attributes is beneficial for any individual, but not everyone excels in this domain. Most executives have reached great heights not solely through fortune, connections, or innate aptitude – the majority of their accomplishments stem from diligent effort. I must assess myself as a leader in this capacity, substantiating my viewpoint with an external outlook and established methodologies. It is crucial to consider how the leader approaches the task of self-assessment, treating it with the same seriousness as appraising his employees. Self-awareness and analytical thinking are crucial proficiencies for any leader, hence the extent to which my personal evaluation aligns with external feedback serves as a significant gauge.

Assessment
Self-Appraisal
To conduct self-evaluation, I employed surveys that have proven effective in this area. These encompass the Emotional and Social Competence Questionnaire (ESCI), which mirrors facets of emotional intelligence and the capacity to recognize one's strengths (Park & Faerman, 2019). Before undertaking the assessment, I outlined my proficiencies in interpersonal communication: adaptability, critical thinking, self-restraint, and the ability to motivate dialogue partners. The challenge affirmed my exceptional performance in communication skills. Adaptability, combined with consistent restraint, facilitates engaging with individuals while safeguarding the primary goals and objectives. This skill ensures that I stay on topic during discussions or negotiations until a compromise or consensus is reached. Moreover, I always strive to support the discussion partner, even if they bring unfavorable news. Everyone is entitled to errors, and one must be willing to acknowledge them. A notable strength of mine is the capability to uplift individuals when they are feeling despondent.

The subsequent survey used for self-assessment is the evaluation of personal worth. While the initial survey highlighted my innate communication abilities, the second one delves into the motivations behind my conduct (Smikle, 2019). There exist three primary leadership styles: autocratic, participative, and delegative (Akpoviroro et al., 2018). As per the assessment results, my approach leans towards accessibility, aligning with participative leadership. This style necessitates heightened levels of emotional intelligence, ensuring maximal productivity in the work environment (Akpoviroro et al., 2018). My authority is not a hindrance or a source of dread for employees – it serves as a mechanism to unveil their capabilities. The results of the survey indicated that adaptability is closely linked to inventive thinking and ingenuity. Identifying avenues for personal growth enables the demonstration of vigor that motivates others.

Input
I garnered input from two former peers and family members. Upon statistical analysis of the data, it surfaced that individuals appreciate my empathy and ability to provide support even in arduous circumstances. This attribute is an outcome of flexibility and adaptability against the backdrop of heightened emotional intelligence. Nonetheless, some respondents expressed concerns about my adeptness in manipulation. Empathy and encouragement can direct individuals towards their aspirations and objectives. This apprehension is valid, and through this assessment, I discerned the areas necessitating personal development. The inclination towards manipulation arises from my inclination towards control. Continuously monitoring situations, as highlighted in the value assessment survey, signifies something not to be trusted or feared.

Opportunities for Advancement
To rectify this characteristic, I sought input from colleagues and family members. I presumed that transparency and articulation of my intentions and objectives to other team members would dispel suspicions of manipulation. However, the feedback indicated that I should verbalize my aspirations and exhibit fairness in my actions. This aligns with the transformative leadership model, which contrasts with individualism, flexibility, and empathy (Eliyana & Ma’arif, 2019). Nevertheless, transformative leadership can be applied specifically in one aspect: being accountable for one's statements and deeds. Each of my intentions should be openly deliberated with the conversational partner, who is entitled to express their viewpoint in return. Subsequently, empathy should underpin every decision-making stage, showcasing adaptability and flexibility. Consequently, I must substantiate my intentions through actions in every conceivable manner. A leader who authentically pursues objectives can guide the entire team with ease if their values are aligned.

Conclusion
A comprehensive approach to scrutinizing my strengths has prompted substantial self-reflection. Feedback from colleagues and family members validated the self-assessment outcomes. This broad perspective enabled the formulation of a plan to enhance leadership competencies and identify primary challenges that impede professional communication. Flexibility and the capacity to inspire individuals constitute the cornerstone of my leadership approach, which I must now reinforce through personal example and actions. Monitoring aids in preserving my critical thinking acumen, albeit it can foster the perception of manipulation. Leveraging heightened emotional intelligence, I must demonstrate to individuals that any proactive stance on my part is purely professional and substantiated by logical arguments.
