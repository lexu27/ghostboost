The expression that captured my attention the most from the video is from Isaiah, declaring that Samuel has instructed him that one individual can play t-ball and strike it hard while seated. This is a compelling declaration signifying that individuals can be biased despite having good intentions. Samuel’s family did not realize the challenges disabled individuals face before he was born (PinehurstPictures, 2010). The child’s depiction hitting the t-ball also highlighted a significant problem, that disabled individuals should be treated likewise to other individuals and provided equal opportunities to enable them to perform optimally.
I was fascinated to witness children like Nathanial Orellana learning in a regular classroom. His mother resolved they actively pursued school to guarantee he received the best care given his autism (PinehurstPictures, 2010). Parents encounter a myriad of additional obstacles nurturing disabled children to offer them advantages that would assist them in competing with their peers in society. The video demonstrates that communities and the government should present parents with a range of schools to select the best for their child’s disability.
Children with disabilities necessitate special care but should be permitted to engage with others if their condition would not deteriorate based on these connections. Involvement is a vital instrument for child development as it demands them to be attentive and active, fostering greater accomplishment due to heightened enthusiasm. Nathanial raises his hand to respond to a question because each student is engaged in the classroom. His eagerness to address the question displays interest and a craving to learn, characteristics linked to high achievement.
The video is beneficial as it offers a peek into the life individuals with disabilities undergo. Many of these parents encounter difficulties with education as they desire their children to obtain the finest education while also evading the obstacles that other children do not confront. Emily, a mental health advocate, has schizophrenia and perceives that individuals without the illness cannot fully comprehend their predicament (PinehurstPictures, 2010). In this regard, individuals without developmental issues may not perceive the challenges they encounter and should strive diligently to aid them in functioning optimally in society. Keith Jones also presents a crucial faction of society. He asserts that individuals should not anticipate children to cultivate good social abilities if they remain in a classroom for eight hours without adequate interaction (PinehurstPictures, 2010). It is essential to acknowledge that inclusion would be effective if children were granted the opportunity to engage frequently despite their disparities.
