The writer introduces the reader to Mrs. Evergreen, who migrated to Canada with her parents roughly 16 years ago. She promptly acquired two positions as a caretaker. She soon encountered her prospective spouse and began cohabitating. They welcomed their first child in 2011 and wedded in 2014. She conceived again and had their second daughter in 2015. Mrs. Evergreen opts to return to school to pursue a different profession, but her husband remains hesitant, noting they only tied the knot a year earlier. However, he relented when a family acquaintance agreed to babysit while she attended school. She excels as a student and gains expertise by offering complimentary services in the community. Upon graduating, she secures a position in a beauty care organization, where she swiftly advances to the managerial role. Nonetheless, the entire workforce is laid off due to government regulations stemming from COVID-19. While at home, she chooses to launch her enterprise. Consequently, she inaugurates The Beauty Shop. Her former colleague learns of her endeavor and takes legal action, citing a non-compete pact Mrs. Evergreen endorsed with her. Mrs. Evergreen enlists a legal representative to advocate for her, but they are defeated in court, resulting in the closure of her new venture. Mrs. Evergreen is deeply distressed and embarrassed as the business was prospering with a steady influx of customers before its shutdown. The legal fees become unmanageable, and she must continue paying her weekly lease. The attorneys suggest relocating the business, but she declines. Concurrently, her two children contract COVID-19 as her despondency reaches its peak, leading her to contemplate self-harm. Evergreen commences using anti-depressant medication. Evergreenâ€™s legal team countersues Stella (her former coworker) for exploiting her during her tenure at their establishment. Stella requests a meeting with Evergreen, who consents, albeit reluctantly at first. Stella recognizes her mistakes, and they mutually decide to drop the legal disputes. Evergreen remains content in her marriage and acknowledges the backing of her loved ones and allies throughout the ordeal. The enterprise garners over a thousand patrons and approximately 150 top-notch evaluations two years later. Reflecting on the tribulations, Mrs. Evergreen advocates for self-assertion and resilience in challenges and urges readers never to surrender since all triumphant narratives commence with obstacles.
