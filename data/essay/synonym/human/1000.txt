Supervising is a process of knowledge interchange, social interaction, and psychological backing received by apprentices in work, vocation, and professional growth. It encompasses informal dialogue, typically between two individuals, over an extended period, between a worker who possesses a substantial amount of pertinent knowledge, insight, or expertise, and an employee or learner who possesses these attributes to a lesser degree. In this context, the overseers must exhibit specific characteristics and distinct behavior to prosper in their endeavors.
One of the fundamental traits of a supervisor that renders them the exemplary expert is adaptability. Nowadays, nearly everything is evolving – science is advancing rapidly, new technologies are being introduced daily, approaches to how scholars need to acquire knowledge and how educators need to impart information are changing. In such an atmosphere, the supervisor must be pliable and receptive to fresh ideas and knowledge to meet escalating demands. Davis (2020) emphasizes that particularly crucial are such humane qualities of an overseer as compassion, benevolence, tolerance, integrity, candor, accountability, impartiality, dedication, emotional stability, and self-assessment, which become professionally substantial prerequisites for fostering favorable supervisory relationships.
The ideal supervisor is characterized by their communication style. The capability to construct efficient and amicable communication is one of the most crucial facets of flawless overseers who will never raise their voice or exceed the boundaries of what is deemed acceptable in interacting with apprentices. Beckett (2020) affirms that the supervisor must organize the work experience, impart it to the fledgling professional, and articulately and consistently convey the requisite information and remarks on the trainee’s work data. Additionally, exemplary supervisors should be leaders because they are not solely instructing but guiding their learners in the correct direction, setting a commendable example, and motivating. Only such a supervisor can garner trust and evolve into a professional who will be appreciated by countless students. It is also imperative to possess a willingness to be a supervisor. Otherwise, it will be perceived as an added burden, which will eventually impact the quality. The supervisor is mandated to harbor a genuine commitment to aiding the protégés, and not merely sporadically evaluating the outcomes of their labor.
Supervisors bear a set of roles and obligations, the efficient execution of which elevates them to the status of the ideal professional. According to Corey et al. (2020), these encompass upholding and stimulating student learning, imparting organizational knowledge, values, benchmarks, and norms, and cultivating students’ constructive work attitudes and corporate ethos. Furthermore, a pivotal facet of the overseer’s duties is pinpointing problematic areas in the student’s vocational training and scrutinizing these aspects.
Hence, based on the aforementioned attributes of an exemplary supervisor, a depiction of an ineffective supervisor can be delineated. The characteristics of such a staff member are bias, incompetence, and reluctance to acknowledge an alternative standpoint, irresponsibility, loquaciousness in communication, exhibition of personal superiority, and apathy toward the profession. Furthermore, ineffectual supervisors cannot communicate effectively as they anticipate others to infer their thoughts and fulfill their unspecified anticipations. In other instances, they are exceedingly tedious to listen to when endeavoring to communicate and convey their message to students. Moreover, such professionals are inclined to critique and, notably, they seldom commend students.
The character of the supervisor plays a pivotal role in the successful or unfavorable adaptation of students or new recruits. Supervisors must not only possess the requisite skills, knowledge, or expertise but also be capable of imparting them accurately and promptly to students and new employees. Consequently, not every individual is suited to fulfilling the functions of a supervisor. Apart from exceptional proficiency in professional skills, supervisors must embody versatile knowledge, be proponents of the fundamental principles of corporate culture, as well as exhibit several personal attributes and a distinct model of conduct.
