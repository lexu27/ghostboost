Android Studio is created for Android to speed up one’s application development. This aids one to construct the highest-quality applications for every Android device. The subsequent are some of the notable features discovered in Android Studio for developing Android applications. Android Studio, following the Intellij IDEA, provides the quickest turnaround on an app developer’s coding and operational workflow. Moreover, its Apply Changes feature enables an app developer to modify resources and push code to a running app without restarting the app. This adaptability helps one to manage how much of the application is restarted when one desires to install and test small, incremental modifications while preserving the device’s existing state. It also includes a code editor function that helps one to work more quickly, write superior code, and be efficient by offering enhanced code completion, code analysis, and refactoring (Horton, 2021). Android Studio will propose suggestions in the dropdown menu as one types.
Additionally, the Android Studio possesses an Android Emulator function that installs and launches one’s apps more rapidly than the actual device. It also enables one to prototype and test an application on various Android device configurations such as tablets, smartphones, Android wearable, and Android Television devices. One can also simulate a variety of hardware features like network latency, GPS location, and multi-touch input and motion sensors. At each level, Android Studio aids Android app developers in ensuring they produce the best code through sample apps and code templates. Android Studio also provides a powerful static analysis framework and incorporates over 365 distinct lintelligence checks throughout one’s entire app. It also includes numerous prompt solutions that assist one to address problems in various categories like security, performance, and precision. Android Studio presents a variety of testing tools and frameworks to aid one in testing the app (Horton, 2021). Android Studio also establishes a unified environment where an app developer can create apps for Android tablets, wearable devices, Android Auto, and Android Televisions.
The Android Studio project development is divided into two files, Java and XML, as these permit one to produce apps using both files. The Android app development framework enables one to create applications using XML and Java. Java and XML files each execute a distinct function in Android App development. Any app produced usually exhibits the following behavior, layout, and resources. Java file in Android Studio is utilized for App’s behavior when one intends the app to execute a task. Java file will equip an android app with an autonomous environment to perform an action. For instance, Android Software Development Kit (SDK) has integrated several standard Java libraries (Boduch & Derks, 2020). Java libraries provide functionalities for mathematical functions, data structures, networking functions, and graphics implementation.
Moreover, an XML file in the Android Studio enables one to generate a layout and resources. When one desires an app to display in a specific manner, then XML file becomes highly beneficial in Android Studio project development. In instances where resources such as files and libraries are occasionally needed, XML proves to be useful. XML offers a permanent, sturdy, verifiable, and non-proprietary file format for both on and off the website to share and store data and text (Boduch & Derks, 2020). The utilization of XML in Android Studio is to form layout files as it allows each tag to be closed and maintains white space as an alternative to using HTML.
