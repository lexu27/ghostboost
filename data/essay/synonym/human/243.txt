In the contemporary world, the nurse’s role is evolving significantly: From serving as a resident aide to the attending physician, the registered nurse (RN) is becoming the crucial link in the clinic. RNs aid in providing a continuum of communication between patients, their families, and medical staff, which implies that treatment and recovery outcomes rely on the efficiency of their work. Given the structural adjustments in the professional role of the registered nurse, I couldn't help but develop an interest in this field. Therefore, my career objective is to pursue a bachelor's degree in nursing as the initial step toward becoming a professional nurse.

Nursing has grown notably important in recent years and became particularly crucial to the clinical system during the COVID-19 pandemic. Presently, there are over 4.2 million registered nurses in the United States (USAHS). This substantial figure represents about 1.3 percent of the nation’s total population, signifying that approximately one in 100 Americans is a registered nurse. This data illustrates the significance of this role to society, as a significant number of individuals from various states would not opt for the profession if it were not in demand. The Rafferty study indicates that "nurses can realize their potential as change agents in constructing a better future for health care" (Rafferty 475). Moreover, USAHS reports that the number of male nurses has tripled over the past 50 years, demonstrating a positive trend in this professional role and the swift elimination of stigma.

Historically, there has been a bias against nurses regarding their significance. While the nurse's role is uncontroversial for patients who frequently visit clinics and other stakeholders, healthy individuals can trigger stigma toward such personnel. This bias is unrelated to the current level of medical advancement since the nurse has long stopped being an adjunct to the physician but has obtained a distinct role, a theoretical basis, and new functions. The opportunities for continuous growth and aiding ill individuals are attributes of today’s RNs that attract me to my career selection. Consequently, my altruistic disposition and aspiration to combat stigma motivate me to persist with my BSN training.

Since my chosen career path is feasible, I must consider the logistical aspects of professional advancement. I must allocate at least four years to acquire my BSN, which is the typical timeframe for an undergraduate degree. However, it is probable that I will desire to pursue further studies beyond the BSN, in which case additional time will be necessary. To be precise, I will state that four years is the minimum duration I aim to cover initially. The expenses are contingent on the location and institution, but the average amount is approximately $40,000 (NJ). Therefore, my strategy is to continue accumulating savings at a compounding interest rate to ensure financial security. I intend to diligently study throughout the four years, complete my assignments, and undertake assessments to acquire the robust knowledge necessary for the future.

To underscore the primary objective, my central career aspiration is to attain a bachelor's degree in registered nursing. This is the most specific and urgent goal I have established for myself in terms of career progression. Nevertheless, once I obtain my BSN, I have no intentions to halt my education, as my aim is to constantly enhance my expertise. Professional growth demands meticulous academic dedication, but additionally, I will need to set aside funds. In other words, over the next four years, my plan is to dedicate myself to my education to fulfill my personal career ambition.
