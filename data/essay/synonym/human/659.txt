Essentially, the reason is the autonomous variable; its worth is unaffected by the other factors in the investigation. The outcome is the reliant variable, and modifications impact its significance in the autonomous variable. The connection between the autonomous and reliant variables is the main focus of the investigation (Pokhariyal, 2019). The autonomous variable in the investigation concept is the circumstance that induces people to feel anxious and uncertain. Therefore, the reliant variable is people's degree of adherence when encountering stressful circumstances. Furthermore, conditions determine whether people are more inclined to display adherence.
The two most crucial aspects of any investigation are dependability and authenticity. As per Cypress (2017), the rigor of the investigation equals the concepts of dependability and authenticity, which are all crucial elements of quality. The more frequently a study's discoveries can be replicated, the more consistent or reliable the phenomena are considered to be (Cypress, 2017). The scientific aspect of dependability presumes that repeated measurements of a study, with the same outcomes, using objective methods confirm the accuracy of the observations.
Hence, to assess the authenticity and dependability of the investigation concept, it is essential to scrutinize the uniformity of gathered data regarding circumstances and people's responses and inclinations towards conformism. Employing investigation techniques with uniformity and caution leads to dependability, which is evident in the clarity of investigation procedures, interpretation, and discoveries. Trustworthy investigation should demonstrate what transpires and is factual, and a valid instrument or measurement should assess what it is meant to scrutinize (Cypress, 2017). Additionally, the investigation data, objectives, and concepts should be precise, factual, and up-to-date. The secondary data and prior investigations could be contrasted with the primary data acquired. The circumstances and conditions and the measurement tools selected for the study should not vary during the inquiries to properly assess and compare the level of adherence.
