Community has always been a fundamental institution influencing the development of states. Communicating in groups, individuals share values, perspectives, and reactions to a specific phenomenon. Interaction in neighborhoods or associations nurtures a public attitude toward various events, shapes a lifestyle, and impacts politics. Hence, the alterations in civic life hold significance for states. Putnam, in his essay “Bowling Alone,” also stresses this concept, indicating that the social life of the USA is deteriorating, and the outcomes of this process are hard to foresee. Active involvement in social processes has always been one of the primary characteristics unique to the country, but the scenario has shifted. Putnam mentions that “tens of millions of Americans had abandoned their parents’ customary willingness to participate in the simplest act of citizenship” (67). This implies that individuals have commenced changing their lifestyles, gravitating toward seclusion and detachment, which is atypical for U.S. society. Moreover, conventional organizations, such as societies, are substituted by new extensive membership groups. Putnam asserts they carry more political significance and could influence the nation; nevertheless, they do not foster civic engagement. “For the vast majority of their members, the only act of membership consists in writing a check for dues or perhaps occasionally perusing a newsletter” (Putnam 70). This statement reveals Putnam's concern regarding the ongoing trend of alienating community members, leading them to become fragmented and disengaged. In the long run, this trend might lead to the breakdown of civic life. The outcomes are unpredictable as the USA has perpetually been a state with robust community connections. Therefore, Putnam warns that unless changes occur, we will bowl alone, distant from others.
