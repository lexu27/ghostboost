An exceptional account regarding India revolves around its ethical symbol, Mahatma Gandhi. Also known as Bapu, Gandhi became India’s initial prime minister after aiding the nation in achieving autonomy through non-aggressive actions. Instead of utilizing armies, Indians employed fasting to pressure Britons to depart the nation, rendering it very distinct. Studies on morals never progress without referencing Gandhi. Bapu commands nearly the same admiration as Aristotle on ethics and the necessity for societal stability. Establishing a connection with Gandhi hence brings joy to Indians. Numerous individuals and groups in the republic aim to advance the first prime minister’s ethical norms, with some achieving notable success. Nonetheless, Gandhi’s philosophy on the nation’s societal, financial, and political domains is severely distorted. Therefore, the subsequent dialogue evaluates the leader’s doctrines on ethics, interfaith relations, and enduring impact. Exploring the leader’s guidelines on the various aspects helps distinguish Bapu’s genuine stances from contemporary tainted interpretations.
Morality encompasses various connotations, including the arrangement of principles and principles distinguishing good and bad. Ethics is the philosophical category through which character is scrutinized. Aristotle and Mahatma Gandhi are the two distinguished morality leaders in history. The latter was a Greek academic with profound sway on global ethics, while Gandhi’s inspiration primarily flourishes in India. Mahatma became India’s initial prime minister after aiding the nation in realizing autonomy through non-aggressive means. Numerous literary outlets contain the leader’s principles for Indian and worldwide citizens. However, Tushar Gandhi emerges as a dependable primary source for those seeking Gandhi’s philosophy on ethics. The writer is the great-grandson of India’s initial prime minister and provides direct narratives embodying the truth on the icon’s positions.
Gandhi’s ethics encompass various themes, including governance, child-rearing, honesty, societal interactions, and the utilization of fasting as a tool. Bapu perceives political leadership as a chance to serve, not exploit individuals. The leader also upholds the necessity for politicians to abide by the law to safeguard its sanctity (144). Gandhi starts his address by apologizing to the audience regarding the family’s incapacity to supply another icon. According to the author, nearly all the persons in the Indian government and political arena contravene Bapu’s ethical tenets. Gandhi (142) alludes to the ongoing public censures among the Indian leaders in combating corruption as a notable divergence from Mahatma’s principles. Anna is a public figure who opines that labeling the other leaders amounts to purifying oneself. Instead of besmirching the other party’s reputation, the speaker asserts that the best approach is to ensure one is clean and then employ the appropriate channels to hold the corrupt individuals accountable.
The application of fasting in contemporary India also contradicts Mahatma Gandhi’s ethical principles. Gandhi (142) remarks that Bapu’s mission hinges on making both the means and the ends equally significant. Consequently, the fasting public figures must comprehend why they undertake that to produce the desired effects. To underscore this narrative, Gandhi (141) furnishes an anecdote highlighting Bibi Amutussalam, one of the nation’s distinguished female public figures. Bibi served as a social worker in Noakhali and a follower of Bapu. A societal conflict involving the desecration of an Indian temple in the village and the pilfering of ceremonial swords from the worship center by Muslims occurs during Bibi’s era, as per Gandhi (142). The disciple then attempts to recover the swords by venturing into the Islamic villages but falls short. She subsequently resorts to fasting to compel the two conflicting communities to reconcile and the Muslims to return all the three stolen swords. The community refunds two swords by the twenty-first day of Bibi’s fasting, during which society members request her to consume something.
Bapu’s reaction upon learning of Bibi’s actions implies the necessity for thoughtful fasting. Bibi declines to eat until all the three swords appropriated from the desecrated temple are returned. Coupled with the disciple’s significance in society, Bibi’s numerous days of fasting instill fear in many individuals. The two estranged communities also unite to care for Bibi, who remains steadfast. Upon being informed of the incident, Mahatma Gandhi writes to Bibi, questioning her clarity on whether her fasting aims to unite Muslims and Indians or is intended for personal detriment (Gandhi 142). Nonetheless, Bibi opts to persist with the fast against Bapu’s counsel. Consequently, Gandhi replies with the ensuing words, which underscore the necessity for consideration when fasting for the common good.
“She is unyielding. And if she desires to expire, then let her pass on. She fails to grasp or acknowledge that the aim is to harmonize the hearts and not reclaim the weapons. Let us not squander our time on her…” (Gandhi 142).
Mahatma Gandhi’s ethical principles on the judiciary require the government’s arm to remain impartial to all persons regardless of the political class or social stature. According to Gandhi (145), India’s judicial structure significantly deviates from Bapu’s moral requisites. The author observes that numerous destitute individuals are incarcerated for minor transgressions, whereas the influential flout the law. Furthermore, even the acquitted low-class Indians continue languishing in prison since no attorneys will aid them in securing release. Many vindicated individuals necessitate someone to deliver their acquittal documents from the courts to the penitentiaries, yet no one volunteers for the task. Instead, nearly all the lawyers in India relish working for the affluent individuals involved in corruption allegations. The legal practitioners leverage their influence and legal acumen to secure the freedom of the corrupt elite clique (Gandhi 145). Consequently, India’s courts and attorneys fall short of adhering to Gandhi’s ethical doctrine and should effect changes.
Mahatma Gandhi’s ethics on child-rearing similarly advocate for parents to regulate the extent of liberty bestowed upon children. Gandhi (144) recounts an episode involving Bapu and Arun, his cherished grandson. As per the author, Arun aspires to capture his grandfather’s picture upon acquiring a camera. He beseeches the senior Gandhi to take the snapshot, but Bapu declines, necessitating Arun to remit five rupees for the photo (Gandhi 144). The stipulation emanates from the fact that Gandhi bills public members desiring to procure his autographed autobiography, a venture that Arun oversees. Arun eventually takes his grandfather’s photo when the luminary is preoccupied. Upon learning of the grandson’s act, Mahatma sequesters the camera until Arun’s parents tender five rupees to the premier. The affair leaves the great-grandson profoundly disheartened since he opines he should never pay for something he owns; the grandfather. Gandhi perceives Arun’s folly, following which he gently advises Arun that failing to extend to his grandson what he does to the public deprives him of the moral authority to enforce the policy on others.
Mahatma Gandhi’s ethical principles refute the “eye for an eye” custom prevalent in contemporary Indian politics. Gandhi (145) juxtaposes Anna and Manish with Mahatma, Hitler, and Winston Churchill to underscore the disparity. According to the orator, Anna and Manish present a skewed rendition of Indian politics by confronting each
