Atlantic City is a well-known seaside town in New Jersey distinguished by its beaches and developed entertainment sector. The town is relatively petite in both dimensions and populace. There are numerous local gambling establishments, multiple lodgings, leisure centers, and stores. The predominant portion of the inhabitants of Atlantic City comprises African-Americans and Caucasians. Local stores are geared towards tourists and offer a broad array of mementos and vintage items such as publications and wine. As Atlantic City is a town situated close to the sea, many local eateries specialize in seafood. The average earnings for an individual residing in Atlantic City, according to the 2021 data, was merely 29,232 USD annually for a household.

The way of life and atmosphere can be classified as a "celebration" or "entertaining" town. Consequently, alcohol and substances are highly favored among locals, which could present a public health concern and is relevant for all age groups entering or living in the town. Furthermore, this concern may only escalate, as a new regulation was enacted in 2020 allowing for the communal consumption of alcohol within the town's tourism zone. Regrettably, alcohol is a component of the town's culture and is embraced, even with the potential lasting impacts drinking can induce on an individual's health. Fortunately, there is an Alcoholics Anonymous outreach center for those in need of such aid and numerous medical emergency facilities, including psychological and behavioral health centers.
