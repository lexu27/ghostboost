Dyslexia impacts children with regular eyesight and intellect in various manners, like an incapacity to read or obtain words. Mentoring or a specialized educational intervention may assist most children with Dyslexia to excel in school. As per the article, Learning difficulties are one of the numerous outcomes of Dyslexia. A youth with Dyslexia will struggle to keep pace with their peers in most classrooms since reading is such a fundamental skill in so many areas. In the absence of therapy, Dyslexia could lead to low self-esteem, behavioral problems such as anxiety or rage, as well as detachment from peers and educators, and parents. If Dyslexia is not identified and dealt with during childhood, it could result in long-term challenges in adulthood. The likelihood of children achieving success in life is diminished if they cannot learn to read and understand. The author clarifies that Attention-Deficit / Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) might complicate the treatment of Dyslexia by inducing challenges in maintaining concentration, hyperactivity, and impulsiveness. Children with Dyslexia are more prone to confront learning obstacles if their siblings and parents endure the same condition.
Moreover, males are more prone than females to endure Dyslexia; nonetheless, the disorder influences individuals of all ages, socioeconomic, and ethnic backgrounds. Children born with dyslexia grapple with reading, comprehension, and spelling. The article broadens my understanding of the subject in several ways. I discovered that Dyslexic children are excellent empathizers; many individuals with Dyslexia possess a genuine personality. The writing and reading challenges could aid children in empathizing with those facing difficulties. The robust aspect of the article is that it has examined the causes and repercussions of Dyslexia with the appropriate age group consideration, specifically, from age 4 to 10. The weak point of the article is that it generalized the sexes without specificity; once more, it solely noted that Dyslexia is more prevalent in male children compared to females without elaborating on the causes. Regarding ethnicity, there is a limited number of research papers concerning Dyslexia among black children and its outcomes. Dyslexia predominantly impacts white children more than black children, and thus the article predominantly focuses on white children. I will employ this article as a component of my capstone project by formulating a public health education proposal on Dyslexia to discourage the public from perceiving Dyslexia as a curse.
