The scientific technique enables researchers to examine different occurrences by testing their presumptions constructed from observations of the nearby world. Due to investigating and trying to elucidate the world, a scientific methodology process employed by scientists was established. It involves steps such as exploration through observation and questioning, testing hypotheses and forecasts, and their validation through experiments or additional observations. Despite the advantage and clarity of the scientific technique, readers should still analytically assess the information presented in papers. Scientific papers frequently tackle contemporary issues of interest to society. For instance, an article acting as a second source and exhibited in The Economist portrays a study examining measures for HIV prevention among young African women (G.C.). The original study was issued by Baird et al. in the scientific periodical The Lancet. In this research, the utilization of the scientific technique is unmistakably followed. The authors noted that African women are compelled to date and wed older men to guarantee their own welfare, but such alliances contribute to the transmission of HIV (Baird et al. 1320). The researchers theorized that giving additional financial aid to young women would alter their lives and not coerce them into marrying older men. Baird et al. conducted a randomized cluster trial to assess their hypothesis. They carried out an experiment offering an extra income to a group of unmarried African women. Consequently, the hypothesis was verified â€“ financial autonomy decreased the occurrence of HIV. When critically appraising an article, it is worthwhile to note that it possesses numerous benefits that confirm its dependability. Specifically, its authors hold Ph.D. degrees; the study was executed under the sponsorship of The World Bank and distributed in a peer-reviewed periodical (Baird et al. 1320). The authors admit that the article has some restrictions, and further investigation is necessary to clarify the discoveries. Nonetheless, their experiment has demonstrated outcomes and could be a crucial measure in decreasing the prevalence of the ailment.
