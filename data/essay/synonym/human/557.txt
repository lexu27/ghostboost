The 1972 German slaughter during the Olympic Games in Munich was astonishing for the whole world. Although terrorism was already a distinguished global menace in the 1970s, security during this occasion was not robust enough to avert the intrusion of the Olympic village by the Palestinian radicals (Hirsch, 2020). According to Spindlove and Simonsen (2018), on “September 5, 1972, eight members of the Palestinian Black September terrorist group infiltrated the village” and “succeeded to secure … nine Israeli captives” (p. 160). They demanded to release more than 200 Palestinian detainees from Israel’s penitentiaries in exchange for the athletes, who would be slain if their demand was not met (Spindlove & Simonsen, 2018). The leaders of the two affected nations resolved not to accept extremists’ conditions. Consequently, the German military squad opened fire on terrorists and their captives, which led to the demise of all of them (Spindlove & Simonsen, 2018). This mishap reinforced Germany’s anti-terrorist organizations, while Israel retaliated with the Operation Wrath of God. Germany had to enforce additional rules that could regulate immigrating Arabs and their associations within the nation to avert similar tragic mishaps in the future. The primary reason why terrorists were able to penetrate the village was that the Games had feeble security that was unarmed (History, 2021). Moreover, theories propose that Palestinian radicals received aid from the management of the Olympic Games, but this data was never verified (Reeve, 2018). Germany founded a GSG-9 agency, which evolved into an elite anti-terror unit (Spindlove & Simonsen, 2018). Its principal role is to combat terrorism and rescue captives in the event of an extremists assault (Reeve, 2018). Furthermore, the government was engaged in a series of official gatherings with the Palestinian Liberation Organization and the leaders of the Arab world to avert similar attacks through collaboration (Hirsch, 2020). This circumstance was embarrassing not only for the German government but also for the entire civilized community; hence, this problem and the significance of counterterrorism were brought to the international stage. Israel’s reaction can be deemed harsh because it involved pursuing and exterminating the guilty parties, labeling the operation with the emotive but fairly pretentious title “Wrath of God.” Israel’s Prime Minister asserted they declined to negotiate with the terrorists because “no Israeli anywhere in the world can feel that his life is secure” (History, 2021). In truth, their primary goal was not only reprisal for the slain athletes; they also wanted to instill fear among all Palestinians. Thus, Israel established a special committee that had to pinpoint and eliminate everyone who was implicated in the Munich massacre (Reeve, 2018). This operation continued for over twenty years, with numerous successes and minor defeats for Mossad (Reeve, 2018). Undoubtedly, this occurrence was a dreadful incident for the Israeli populace and the global community. In conclusion, the tragic mishap that occurred at the 1972 Olympic Games in Germany highlighted the existing security issues in the country. Since Palestinian terrorists targeted Israeli athletes, who perished during the rescue operation, the government of Israel retaliated with their preparedness to eradicate the involved individuals and groups. Germany also bolstered its counterterrorist measures by establishing a special agency to combat extremism in the nation. All in all, it seems that the Munich catastrophe became the basis for the heightened awareness about extremists internationally and coordinated counterterrorism efforts in the impacted nations.
