My field is Networking, and I have selected two articles concerning modern technology. The initial article is authored by Benzaid and Taleb (2020) and printed in IEEE Network, exploring how artificial intelligence impacts 5G networks. The subsequent article is from Zhang et al. (2021) and evaluates the compatibility of BIM software tools and addresses issues in data exchange. It was released in the journal Computer Applications in Engineering Education. In addition to researchers, the target audience of the first article is data security agents as it offers insights into how implementing artificial intelligence in 5G can be vulnerable to external attacks. The second article's intended readers are educators in engineering education as it discusses teaching methods in engineering. This paper reviews the articles by Benzaid and Taleb (2020) and Zhang et al. (2021).

Initially, understanding the content of each article is essential. Both articles are scientific and employ quantitative and qualitative research techniques. Benzaid and Taleb (2020) caution readers that to fully enjoy the advantages of 5G, it is crucial to establish robust and enduring security mechanisms that can handle the constantly evolving threat landscape. They propose that conventional security measures are insufficient due to the increasing vulnerabilities, complex cyber threats, high traffic volume, and the variety of technologies (e.g., SDN, NFV) and services influencing future wireless networks. According to Benzaid and Taleb (2020), a novel security measure that should be contemplated is the adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI). They define AI as a technique that would enable intelligent, adaptable, and autonomous security management, facilitating swift and cost-effective detection and mitigation of security threats. Their depiction implies that AI is a promising avenue. Furthermore, Benzaid and Taleb (2020) depict AI's constructive aspects, such as its capability to recognize concealed patterns in an extensive array of time-varying multi-dimensional data, allowing for quicker and more precise decision-making.

Regarding Zhang et al.'s (2021) second article, it presents a case study on the creation of a new capstone project for engineering students. It is founded on team-based learning (TBL) combined with the 360-degree evaluation feedback technique to enhance students' BIM proficiency. Data is gathered and scrutinized using a blend of qualitative and quantitative methodologies to evaluate students' learning results and BIM competence. The outcomes demonstrate that TBL, when coupled with 360-degree feedback in the capstone project, can notably enhance graduates' BIM expertise. This research explores the interoperability of BIM software platforms, data exchange challenges, and suggestions for enhancing the curriculum and BIM team collaboration. In contrast to the first article, the second one is research-based and offers substantial evidence to back its assertions. Benzaid and Taleb's (2020) article captivates the audience by examining all potential security scenarios and dissecting specific facets of AI and 5G networks.

The study by Zhang et al. (2021) reveals how students' professional skills can be enhanced through a capstone project, and educators can utilize the BIM course to mold engineers that align closely with industry requirements. The article advocates for utilizing the capstone project to assist engineering students in refining and cultivating their BIM proficiency in MEP systems. This study introduces a new approach for integrating TBL and 360-degree feedback in engineering education. Regarding the validation of each article's contentions, Zhang et al. (2021) is more credible as it presents a specific case.

Concerning the structure of both articles, they are both heavily theoretical, featuring numerous citations and references to prior literature. Benzaid and Taleb (2020) offer visual aids illustrating how AI and 5G function, elucidating their concepts for better comprehension. For instance, they demonstrate the mapping of adversarial ML attacks to the ML5G high-level architecture. In contrast, Zhang et al. (2021) present descriptive statistics and t test outcomes in a table while conducting an extensive analysis of the data. Therefore, it can be inferred that both articles rely on logic rather than emotions as they are composed in a scientific manner, grounded in factual data. Additionally, both articles exhibit a coherent progression of ideas and assertions substantiated by a diverse array of numerical data and evidence.

The significance of AI in fortifying security in 5G networks and beyond was emphasized in the article by Benzaid and Taleb (2020). It also highlighted the security apprehensions that may arise if unscrupulous individuals exploit the anticipated benefits of AI. Several defense mechanisms were recommended to enhance resilience against AI attacks within the ML5G unified architecture components. Despite their advantages, each proposed countermeasure has its limitations, and none can be deemed an all-encompassing solution to address all AI threats. Hence, one potential research avenue could explore how these countermeasures could be amalgamated to meet both security and performance objectives.

Zhang et al. (2021) aim to persuade their audience that employing TBL and 360-degree evaluation feedback is beneficial for engineering education. Enhanced BIM competencies for the AECO sector are crucial if Industry 4.0 is to be effectively embraced across the construction industry; engineering educational programs play a pivotal role in achieving this objective. The unique amalgamation of TBL and 360-degree evaluation feedback in the engineering capstone project plays a significant role in cultivating, evaluating, and acquiring educational proficiency in undergraduate engineering majors, according to this empirical research study. This study delves into the correlation between 360-degree assessment feedback and TBL integration to foster BIM competencies in MEP systems for engineering students, making it a pioneering investigation. The case study findings indicate that BIM competencies are honed through comprehensive evaluation feedback and practical exercises. The results also underscore the substantial impact of collaborative abilities, particularly in the evaluation, feedback, and enhancement cycle through reflection, which is crucial for students' BIM competency development.

The content of both articles offers a comprehensive examination of their subjects. The articles aim to inform readers about their discoveries and persuade them about the significance of their work. The articles share a similar organizational structure, yet Benzaid and Taleb's (2020) article has numerous subsections that aid readers in comprehending the text thoroughly. For instance, there are various subtopics related to 5G network management and risk assessment. The paragraphs in both articles are extensive and present factual data alongside their analysis. Each paper includes an in-depth literature review that delineates the state of scholarship at present and provides insights into the addressed literature aspects. These prior scholarly works were referenced using the Harvard citation style. From a reader's viewpoint, the chosen citation style was suitable and facilitated source verification.

The methodologies employed in both papers differ as they investigate significantly different subjects. The research study by Zhang et al. (2021) is structured into five segments. The study commences with an examination of BIM education and capstone projects in MEP systems, along with TBL and 360-degree evaluation feedback in education. Subsequently, the TBL educational approach was devised for the BIM capstone, integrated with 360-degree evaluation feedback. This BIM capstone project approach (i.e., TBL paired with BIM 360-degree evaluation feedback) aims to support students and educators in MEP systems instruction and practice, tailoring the teaching content to diverse engineering specialties' requirements. TBL was paired with 360-degree evaluation feedback in the BIM
