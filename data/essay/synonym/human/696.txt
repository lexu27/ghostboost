Synopsis
The scrutinized study was focused on deliberating the crucial function of nurses in preventing diagnostic mistakes. The investigator assessed nurses' involvement in the diagnostic process based on the empirical literature examination. Afterward, they suggested the theoretical framework of how the healthcare institution can diminish diagnosis inaccuracies. The conceptual framework was aimed at devising and providing the blueprint to enhance nurses' participation in the diagnostic process. The final phase was to demonstrate the outcomes of the framework application. Drawing from the theoretical literature analysis, the research authors introduced an extensive model of complete nursing involvement named the tripartite framework (Baker et al., 2017). The model comprised three fundamental elements: interdisciplinary collaboration, patient empowerment, and the nurses' participation in recognizing the diagnostic indicators (Baker et al., 2017). Following the practical model application, the results indicated a decline in diagnostic inaccuracies and omissions, an increase in diagnosis duration, and an overall rise in patient safety levels (Baker et al., 2017). The model also stressed the significance of patient experience and involvement in the diagnostic process through the nurses.
The organized literature information presented in the form of the framework was utilized within the specific institution. The empirical outcomes contributed to identifying the four potential obstacles to nursing involvement, encompassing culture, education, regulation, and operations (Baker et al., 2017). Scientists also offered the resolutions to the mentioned challenges as an additional segment of the conceptual framework. Concerning the cultural obstacle, the psychology of the nurses' self-identification was a crucial issue. A significant proportion of nurses and clinicians believed that nurses should not engage in the diagnostic process (Baker et al., 2017). Nevertheless, the research underscored that nurses cannot be excluded from the diagnostic process as they play a role in establishing patient-physician relationships.
Involving nurses in the diagnostic process was executed by diverse medical establishments. Investigators provided instances of such incorporation and evaluated the findings indicating an enhanced level of patient contentment and a reduced rate of medication errors (Baker et al., 2017). In an effort to surmount this obstacle, the researcher recommended implementing the engaging policy by the medical managerial bodies. To tackle the education obstacle, medical providers should offer nurse educational programs focused on specific diagnostic principles (Baker et al., 2017). Furthermore, accredited educational institutions should introduce interdisciplinary training sessions in the standard students' curricula. The operational obstacle can be overcome by appropriate nurse staffing regulations and by eradicating turnovers (Baker et al., 2017). The regulation obstacle is linked with the absence of governmental or administrative acts regulating nursing practices. Researchers illustrated the connection between the practical examples of the nurse practice acts enacted in some states and the heightened level of patient satisfaction (Baker et al., 2017). Despite some obstacles being challenging to surmount, the subsequent framework application is anticipated to reduce diagnosis errors.
Factors and Hypothesis
Throughout their exploration, researchers furnished the practical scientific experiments results that were previously conducted to demonstrate that the solutions are logical and pertinent to the subject. Such theoretical factors indicated that medical providers succeeded in reducing the diagnosis risks by employing some of the framework's concepts. Consequently, the researchers amalgamated the outcomes of the developed framework research and the comparative analysis of other scientific experiments to design and organize the obstacles for their model application. The conceptual model featured precise guidance to amplify the nurses' involvement in the diagnosis. Owing to the extensive literature scrutiny, the model was intricate and user-friendly in practice. Consequently, its execution within a distinct medical institution was a manageable task. Nevertheless, the question of its effectiveness on a broader range of factors emerges.
