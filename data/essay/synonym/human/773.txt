As previously stated, both images portray a similar subject. Despite being made in different eras, these two pieces communicate the same idea that personal struggle is the source of hope in people's hearts. Both artworks share similarities and distinctions based on the symbolic elements illustrated by the creators. The remarkable symbolic aspect of the Girl with the Pearl Earring painting is the earring. Given the general appearance of the girl, the earring captures attention. As mentioned before, this symbol was crafted to represent the deceptive nature of hope (Berg et al., 2019). It was formed solely by the presence of dark hues in the backdrop. Hence, this uplifting symbol indicates that hope cannot arise without darkness and desolation.

Christina’s World also contains a distinct symbol conveying the artist’s concept. However, this symbol is utilized to depict despair. The dark band on the woman’s attire symbolizes the paralyzed section of her body (Benson, 2020). Unlike the symbol in the first artwork, the band conveys the negative context of the narrative. The concept of hope is conveyed through portraying a woman's residence and her deliberate posture striving toward the light. Thus, the artworks are analogous in utilizing symbolism to emphasize the need to strive for hope. Nevertheless, the quantity and arrangement of symbols differ.

Considering the means that might have empowered the creation of both artworks, Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet should be acknowledged. The themes of hope and despair are fundamental components of this tragedy. Some scholars suggest that Girl with the Pearl Earring was inspired by Shakespeare’s tale (Berg et al., 2019). The woman turns towards her beloved, who is perceived as the viewer of the painting. Some analysts find Christina’s World's narrative akin to Shakespeare’s tragedy (Benson, 2020). Christina is distanced from her loved ones by a cruel fate, and only by reaching for hope can she reunite with her family. Consequently, based on the analysis conducted, the thesis can be formulated as follows: the examined paintings embody the theme of self-created hope in the midst of surrounding despair.

The identified theme can influence professionals in various fields. Social workers' activities are directly impacted by the discussed subject. Their primary goal is to support others emotionally and mentally, thereby enhancing others' quality of life. Hence, they must maintain mental resilience and consistently foster hope for themselves and those they aim to assist. Educators may also be influenced by this subject as they are responsible for nurturing the future generation, a crucial role for society at large. Failing to instill hope and encourage striving for improvement amidst the world's harshness can affect children and render them emotionally fragile. Teachers should educate young individuals never to relinquish hope in their journey.

Given the existential nature of the theme, the audience for the presentation could be quite diverse. Individuals seeking insight into art and humanities and those looking to share their emotional challenges with others may find the presentation intriguing. Additionally, the theme can benefit professionals in the aforementioned fields by enriching their understanding of humanities.

Conveying the message effectively involves utilizing visual aids. For instance, presenting a detailed examination of certain painting elements and symbols on screen would be prudent. Since the presentation targets a general audience, some scholarly terms may be unfamiliar to them, particularly those related to historical styles and traditions that influenced painting creation. To prevent complicating the message, the use of such terms should be minimized, retaining only the most essential ones crucial for conveying the main ideas. Providing a handout with highlighted terms could help acclimate the audience to these concepts.

Establishing a connection with the target audience is crucial for a successful presentation. Engaging in dialogue and interaction with the audience to foster involvement in the theme and humanities is key. Aligning the speaker and audience creates an opportunity to captivate attention (Dragomir, Francisco-Lens, & Rodríguez-Vázquez, 2022). If the audience expresses interest in the material presented, even complex terms can be retained to promote scientific advancement in humanities.

Hence, the examination of the two artworks: Girl with a Pearl Earring and Christina’s World, reveals that these cultural creations share similarities in terms of the theme and motifs. The artists employ symbolic elements differently but convey the common notion of the struggle for hope in human existence. Given the profound nature of the theme, the humanitarian analysis of it can appeal to individuals of various ages and professions. When addressing a general audience, the presentation of the theme should focus on clear explanations, while scientific terms should not be omitted but rather explained for audience comprehension. This approach facilitates the effective communication of the ideas conveyed by the artists and researchers.
