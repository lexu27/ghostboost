There are numerous US criminal cases that raise the issue of trying juvenile offenders in adult courts. Currently, almost in half of the states in the nation, juveniles can be prosecuted and tried in adult courts. Pennsylvania is one such state, as there is no lower threshold for the age someone can be charged as an adult with homicide. The 2009 case involving a double murder illustrates the various issues that occur in all similar cases.
In February 2009, state police found 26-year-old Kenzie Houk, who was eight months pregnant, in her bed with a bullet through her head. Jordan Brown, the son of the victim’s fiancé, is one of the youngest suspects in the nation to be charged with murder. According to Heide (2021), juvenile murder arrests in the United States increased significantly from 1984 to 1993, leading experts to predict an epidemic of continued violence. Since then, various approaches and techniques have been tested to reduce juvenile violence. However, they have not provided a highly efficient consistent framework that can help mitigate the issue.
A wide array of factors should be taken into consideration when understanding the reasons for such a severe problem in the nation. Furthermore, a dedicated analysis is required to understand the effectiveness of the already existing programs and institutions aimed at reducing the risks of violent crime among juveniles. Additionally, the issue of recidivism should be widely discussed, as preventing it has always been viewed as one of the primary goals of the institutions that work with juvenile criminals. A large number of evidence-based practices are to be considered when providing the best solutions that can help develop a consistent approach to the issue in all states.
