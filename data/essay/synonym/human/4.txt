Charles Schwab is a for-profit Enterprise whose primary business is savings and loans. The business offers banking and asset management services, as well as financial guidance. It has numerous affiliates - Charles Schwab & Co., Inc., Charles Schwab Investment Management, Inc., TD Ameritrade, Inc., and TD Ameritrade Clearing, Inc., all of which are limited liability firms (“The Charles Schwab Corporation,” 2021). This document seeks to examine the business structure within Charles Schwab Corporation (CSC).
Charles Schwab is a corporation, a type of business with some unique characteristics. Firstly, its executives act as agents, unlike its directors and shareholders, indicating that the latter are not engaged in the company’s current strategic, managerial, and other business decisions (“Corporation,” 2022). Secondly, the corporation is overseen by the board of directors who possess the authority to designate the executives. This method establishes a equilibrium of managerial powers, as CEOs and CFOs are actively engaged in the operational processes, and the board of directors, in extreme scenarios, holds the power to remove them by voting.
Within the corporation, shareholders have the liberty to transfer ownership, allowing the corporation to be sold to a different proprietor in dire situations such as bankruptcy. This possibility exists because the corporation is an entity that offers an opportunity for investors to gain by investing, unlike a Limited Liability Company (“Forming a corporation,” 2022). Lastly, in corporations, earnings are subject to double taxation: initially at the corporate level, and then again if dividends are distributed to shareholders.
Therefore, the business structure within Charles Schwab Corporation was examined. The CSC is a corporation with multiple subsidiaries and conducts business in accordance with the criteria for a corporate form of organization. A notable aspect of corporations is the board of directors, which exerts an indirect impact on daily decision-making. Nonetheless, in crucial situations, it can select new executives to oversee the company. Corporations also have the ability to transfer ownership rights in the event of bankruptcy or other circumstances.
