The cultural implications of Roman control over the Greek-speaking territories is an intriguing subject that has garnered significant scientific attention, particularly in recent years. The influence of the interaction between two societies varied over time and location and was notably more noticeable in areas where Roman communities had established. These communities acted as the so-called influence vectors, and their prolonged coexistence with Greeks led to the transfer of Roman aspects into public life.
One of these aspects was Roman titles, the spread of which can be clarified by the presence of networks of trade and the sense of self of name carriers. Rizakis (2019) points out that the introduction of the Greeks to the Roman naming system with its subsequent adjustment to their standards and the adoption of Roman titles by foreign Greeks are two distinct occurrences. Nonetheless, they both serve as instances of the interaction process between the two customs, which gradually gave rise to a shared onomastic culture. This process of acculturation, intensified in the 2nd century AD, displayed considerable regional variation, and its reception varied across different cities and social strata.
These cultural exchanges were primarily facilitated by civic elites, as their aim was to extend their influence through names – both within a regional framework and more broadly, at a systemic level. Tria nomina, specifically, and its utilization in the imperial era specifically, as highlighted by Rizakis (2019), represented a source of honor, authority, and distinction. Consequently, certain titles gained popularity as symbols of the common culture and were embraced and integrated, albeit to a limited extent, by the lower classes as well, having shed their original significance.
Nevertheless, the prevalence of Roman titles as markers of the Empire's citizens' status was short-lived. According to Rizakis (2019), by the conclusion of the 3rd century AD, a novel method of identity representation emerged – a unified naming convention employing distinct Greek and Roman titles. Initially, it was employed sparingly, but following the rule of Constantine – and particularly during the period of late antiquity – it began to be utilized in nearly all Roman provinces. This transformation, encouraged by the advancement of Christianity and the decline of the Roman Empire, could be interpreted as a revival of the Greek naming practice.
