There are three primary kinds of domestic violence apprehension laws evident in the United States. The apprehension rules utilized by different states incorporate compulsory apprehension, pro-apprehension, and permissive apprehension laws. Subsequently, there frequently emerges a debate on which of the policies serves best in safeguarding the victims of domestic violence. Consequently, there are countless arguments on the strengths and constraints of each regulation, as hypothesized by scholars and laypeople alike. Nonetheless, the optimal technique for determining which stipulations best safeguard victims involves collecting data on which methods lead to lower re-offending rates.
The fundamental objective of any domestic violence apprehension law is to safeguard the victim and ensure no repetition of the harshness within homes while also maintaining families. Surveys from the criminal justice system suggest that only 10% of apprehended individuals proceed to re-offend, while 26% of those compelled to depart/separated re-offended, and 18% of those positioned under counseling re-offended (Karmen, 2020). The data indicates that apprehensions efficiently decrease re-offending rates, which significantly aids in protecting victims. Therefore, compulsory apprehension policies requiring the law enforcement officer to apprehend wherever there is probable cause that violence transpired are most crucial. Such laws function as an efficient deterrence against DV, as the data indicates.
Moreover, compulsory apprehension policies shift the entire responsibility of apprehension onto the police. Consequently, the already traumatized victim endures reduced pressure regarding the apprehension of their spouse, boosting the likelihood of perpetrator reforms and preservation of the marriage. According to Karmen (2020), compulsory apprehension policies notably eliminate the immediate source of danger from home, safeguarding the victim. Compulsory apprehensions separate married couples to provide them time to ponder on their marriage and discover the way forward. In numerous instances, the policies eliminate the necessity for retribution against the offender by the battered spouse. The offenderâ€™s displacement safeguards both the offender and victim from further crimes and homicides. According to the National Institute of Justice, compulsory apprehension laws are the most prevalent in US states, indicating a widespread consensus on their effectiveness.
