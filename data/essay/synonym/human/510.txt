Financial report analysis instruments include proportion, perpendicular, and parallel analysis. Thus, this part will aim to explore the advantages and disadvantages of the specified financial evaluation instruments. Proportion analysis aids in the determination of efficiency in operations and in scrutinizing the financial budget of the organization. However, the proportion analysis tool is beneficial only when the competing organization is of the same magnitude and kind. Similarly, it overlooks the existing and forthcoming data trends and concentrates on previous data hence, not an efficient analysis tool. The perpendicular financial analysis instrument offers a simpler way to contrast financial statements within an organization as well as among different organizations. Nonetheless, the perpendicular analysis instrument does not assess the liquidity of the organization. The parallel analysis instrument enables straightforward interpretation of organizationsâ€™ extensive information as well as monitoring expansion and financial trends. Nevertheless, parallel analysis is perceived as erratic due to constantly changing accounting principles and elements. Financial report analysis facilitates the financial strategies and administration of an organization by evaluating the cash flows, liability, business trends, and budget planning. Various financial report analysis techniques are employed in an effort to acquire organizational data and information concerning the assets, liabilities, profits earned, losses sustained, growth, and competition trends.
