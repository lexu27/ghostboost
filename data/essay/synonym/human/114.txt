One of the most crucial factors of breast cancer progression is genetics as it leads to a genetically innate condition. If the patient’s closest family members have been diagnosed with breast cancer, the probability of a tumor is high even at a young age (Coleman & Tsongalis, 2016). Since one of the patient’s close kin had this illness, this diagnosis is indeed feasible for her as well. Another significant element in cancer development is various ailments of the mammary glands, such as "cystic" breasts. When such conditions are present, the development of abnormal cells is possible in the mammary gland (Tkaczuk et al., 2016). This can result in their proliferation and escalate the risk of more severe illnesses.
The hormonal aspect also plays a vital role in well-being. In the described scenario, this facet is the most crucial as it encompasses diverse aspects of the patient’s life. These encompass the initial pregnancy after 30 years, not nursing, and numerous years of consuming hormonal contraceptives. This leads to the patient’s hormonal equilibrium potentially being disrupted (Tkaczuk et al., 2016). Consequently, as time progresses, it becomes increasingly challenging for the body to manage irregular processes.
If cancer is in its early stage, there may be no spread to the patient’s organs. However, early aggressive metastasis is characteristic of aggressive cancer forms. There are numerous methods to identify them, and it is imperative to utilize some of them in any situation to prevent future health issues. Examination of tissue histology can determine the aggressiveness of the cancer variant at an early phase. Breast cancer metastases detected by CT or scintigraphy indicate secondary sites in the lungs, liver, bones, and brain. It should be noted that in breast cancer, metastases can persist for a prolonged period in a dormant state, even five to ten years after elimination of the primary tumor.
