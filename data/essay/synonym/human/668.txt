Shakespeare’s drama Macbeth has been captured dozens of times by outstanding filmmakers from around the globe. The movie examined here was unveiled in the United Kingdom in 2010 and overseen by Rupert Goold. Indeed, the British contributed the highest number of Macbeth’s interpretations to the world. This rendition of Macbeth is not deemed the most widely watched and debated one. Nevertheless, it possesses numerous exceptional attributes to rank among the finest films inspired by Shakespeare’s dramas.

The primary captivating aspect of this movie is the performer embodying Macbeth’s character on screen. It is Patrick Stewart, the renowned actor recognized for his role in the X-Men movie series. Stewart has executed an exceptional performance to grasp the profundity of Shakespeare’s Macbeth. Through his movements, dialogue delivery, and performance, one can sense the dual nature of this Scottish commander. While Stewart portrays Macbeth’s authority and vigor, there is also an element of fragility and disquiet in the character. Regarding the other performers, I was unfamiliar with them before viewing the film. The performer whose technique and portrayal I admired is Kate Fleetwood as Lady Macbeth. She appears truly malevolent and intimidating due to her icy demeanor.

The design of the attire and settings is truly contemporary, which transforms this adaptation significantly from the original. While Shakespeare’s drama unfolded in the 11th century in Scotland, the film’s design more closely aligns with the 20th-century events. It is uncommon to witness such an interpretation of the play by the author, a narrative familiar to all from their school days. It appears that Goold aimed to explore the totalitarian regimes of the 20th century through the context of the 11th-century drama. The most notable scene is when an unidentified man observes a military procession resembling Soviet or Nazi parades. Subsequently, the film depicts a grand hall with a portrait of Macbeth, styled akin to communist leaders (Stalin or Mao Zedong).

In line with the era of the first half of the 20th century, the costumes in the movie Macbeth are fitting. Nearly all the costumes resemble the attire of NKVD officials and the upper echelon’s uniforms during the Great Terror of the 1930s. For instance, in the initial segment of the film, Macbeth’s outfit and Stewart’s facial hair strongly resemble Joseph Stalin’s appearance. Another memorable attire is the garments of three witches, depicted as medical caregivers in the film. Their pallid visages and matching hospital attire establish a macabre aesthetic, intensifying anxiety as the film progresses.

Lastly, the utilization of sound and illumination may intrigue numerous observers of Macbeth. The film’s musical score is crafted to heighten the tension and disconcerting ambiance throughout the narrative. This music complements the abrupt and startling noises that can arise at any juncture in the film. Various cries, sudden distortions, and loud sounds sustain the horror ambiance at a heightened level. Concerning the lighting effects, there is scarcely a scene devoid of dominant black hues. Another distinct feature is the director’s attempt to depict the characters' ambiguity through the use of monochromatic costumes. This establishes a color contrast that appears to carry a concealed significance.

In conclusion, the 2010 rendition of Macbeth showcases a remarkable fusion of medieval Scottish history and 20th-century sinister occurrences. Rupert Goold succeeded in rejuvenating the classical drama and prompted viewers to contemplate the relevance of Macbeth’s narrative. Nonetheless, it appears that Goold did not manage to shift the focus away from the central figure of Patrick Stewart. With the exception of Kate Fleetwood, other actors remained overshadowed by the esteemed actor.
