Nursing coalitions are quite prevalent in numerous countries globally, facilitating nurse practitioners' professional progress. The American Association of Critical Care Nurses (AACN) is one such group. The coalition was established in 1969 in response to nurses' necessity to exchange knowledge and acquire more educational chances (American Association of Critical Care Nurses [AACN], n.d.). This document contains a concise outline of the choices the organization presents to its members.
Nurses discover joining nursing coalitions as a valuable encounter and a stage for additional progress. Significantly, this development encompasses each nurse's professional advancement, as well as all members' contributions to the development of the nursing practice (Rowley et al., 2020). This involvement in the network of devoted professionals can be especially advantageous for nurses working at advanced care units in the neuro/cardio units. The practitioners operating in this domain need to be sophisticated multitaskers who have to make numerous intricate decisions during their workdays. They also need to stay updated on new techniques and practices, which can be challenging without interacting with other professionals. The ACCN is a valuable channel for such interaction as well as education since the organization (like many other similar institutions) offers multiple programs for its members. Practitioners can also receive the required certification concerning their advanced credentials.
AACN is a nonprofit organization that acts as a platform for nurse practitioners' growth and professional advancement. The coalition's mission is to provide nurses with the necessary foundation for "expert knowledge and the influence to fulfill their promise to patients and their families" (AACN, n.d.). Excellence in practice is the primary value of the coalition, which shapes the opportunities it provides to its members. The AACN assists nurse practitioners in achieving excellence by delivering education and certification support, networking, and recognition.
Regarding recognition, the coalition's excellence programs strive to acknowledge the professionals who propel nursing practice and research. Circle of Excellence award and Beacon award are examples of such endeavor (AACN, n.d.). Peers select the most exceptional nominee, which demonstrates the relevance and significance of these individuals' work. Notably, only association members can be nominated for the circle of excellence award, while the Beacon award can be granted to non-members (AACN, n.d.). This flexibility promotes the exchange of ideas and practitioners' willingness to self-develop and advance professionally. It is also crucial to note that this recognition also aims at advocating for nurses' needs and promoting nursing practice (Huang et al., 2020). Nurses must feel their contribution is valued, which results in improved performance and job satisfaction.
Concerning the networking opportunities of this coalition, the organization provides educational programs, certification choices, research grants, as well as participation in various events and conferences. Nurses (particularly new practitioners) benefit from membership in such organizations as they establish social connections with other professionals. They encounter different individuals committed to research and excellence in specific fields during conferences and diverse events. These connections are typically sustained for an extended period, enabling professionals to exchange their knowledge and experience, as well as concerns and ideas. Nursing coalitions are also instrumental in empowering nurses and aiding them in performing more advanced roles in the clinical setting (Villeneuve & Betker, 2020). Educational programs are equally valuable as practitioners learn about the specifics of their practice and ways other individuals utilize to cope with the challenges of the profession.
One of the valuable advantages of AACN membership is that the coalition keeps its members informed of the most recent changes in nursing, as well as various specialty fields. The AACN notifies its members in various ways, including direct emails and notifications, as well as press releases and diverse sources regarding the most meaningful events and advances. Furthermore, the coalition organizes various conferences and other professional gatherings where the latest advancements in all utilizing areas are discussed. Nurses can exchange ideas and apply the knowledge they acquire in their practice and research.
Regarding educational chances available from the AACN, the coalition provides a plethora of programs and projects facilitating nurses' continuous education and professional development. The organization offers online courses and webinars, as well as scholarships to its members. AACN members can also acquire a substantial amount of information from the most renowned nursing scholarly journals. Thus, one of the remarkable characteristics of AACN membership is an opportunity to implement research and continue education in the area of interest. The AACN continuing education activities can be a valuable platform for professional progress. AACN members can learn about and utilize other practitioners' ideas to enhance their practice.
In conclusion, it is essential to mention that the AACN is one of the most influential nursing coalitions that contributes to the progression of nursing practice. AACN members have various chances to continue their formal or on-the-job training, establish social links and networks, as well as implement research. AACN recognition programs are crucial in assisting nurses in feeling motivated and dedicated to the highest standards of nursing practice.
