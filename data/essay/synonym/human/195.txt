The healthcare sector generally garners adequate focus on patients' instruction, notably regarding representatives of minority communities. Therefore, the article by McCurley et al. (2017) provides valuable insights. The investigators illustrate that Hispanic individuals experience enhanced diabetes prevention through engagement in one-on-one and group in-person meetings (McCurley et al., 2017). I am convinced that there is a clear rationale behind the achievement of such favorable results. It appears that in-person interventions are efficacious because patients can seek clarifications by posing inquiries. Concurrently, such educational meetings reveal that a patient is not singular in facing a health concern. Consequently, these interventions can enhance individuals' spirits, thereby fostering increased drive to adopt preventive measures and safeguard well-being.

These details suggest that in-person interventions may be appropriate for my practicum initiative focusing on strategies to enhance care accessibility among African Americans grappling with heart failure ailments. Nonetheless, emphasizing patients' cultural backgrounds should not result in overlooking a broader framework. This assertion aligns with the discoveries by Cajiita et al. (2017), who assert that the utilization of mobile technology in healthcare (mHealth) can advance knowledge. These academics concentrated on 129 elderly individuals, with nearly a quarter being African Americans, to assess whether mHealth enhances care (Cajiita et al., 2017). Leveraging mobile technologies can be as potent as in-person interventions because contemporary individuals dedicate more time online. Hence, it is sensible to leverage mHealth prospects to bolster care accessibility among African Americans. Ultimately, it can be proposed that integrating mobile technologies and in-person educational gatherings can yield optimal results.
