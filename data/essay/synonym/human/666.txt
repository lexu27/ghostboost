The Lessons from Yusufiyah article recounts the occurrences encompassing the notorious 2006 slaughter at Yusufiyah. The sorrowful tale implicated four American Soldiers who in intoxicated fury intruded an Iraqi Civilian household, sexually assaulting the daughter and slaughtering the entire Family. This might have remained undisclosed and concealed if not for the courage and ethical stance of Pvt. Justin P. Watt, a young member of the unit who confidentially probed the unfolding incidents and ultimately opted to disclose it to ensure that those accountable faced justice. During his stint in Iraq, Pvt. Watt encountered a potentially morally injurious incident as an indirect observer to the massacre, which triggered emotional distress and moral dilemmas for him, and a strategy for rebirth is deliberated.

Morally injurious experiences (MIEs) are defined as occurrences, exposures, or stimuli that transgress or breach an individual's deeply ingrained moral convictions or principles, linked with psychological distress as a reaction. The MIE that impacted Pvt. Watt was the massacre. Although he was not physically there, he was a second-hand witness, initially learning the account from Sgt. Yribe and subsequently obtaining more detailed information from Pfc. Howard. Pvt. Watt was also on radio surveillance duty on the night of the massacre and he utilized the fragments of information to infer the approximate circumstances of the incident. Pvt. Watt comprehended that his comrades in the platoon including Green and potentially others had sexually assaulted a teenager, slain a Family, and obscured evidence. Moreover, Sgt. Yribe neglected his duty as the team leader to seek justice despite being aware of the facts and is also complicit in the cover-up. Pvt. Watt reflects, "I couldn't fathom what it would have been like, hearing everyone screaming," indicating that he is envisioning the incidents based on the available information. Despite not physically witnessing or participating in the massacre, he is experiencing guilt and repercussions akin to witnessing it. These are indications of PTSD and emotional distress.

This occurrence has a direct adverse impact on the Soldier by placing him in a morally conflicting situation. Pvt. Watt is torn between allegiance to his unit and comrades and the Army's regulations and moral principles, undergoing emotional distress. Furthermore, the Soldier is visibly appalled at the prospect that his platoon members and American Soldiers could have partaken in such unethical and atrocious conduct. Pvt. Watt mourns the loss of innocent Civilian lives and questions his morality as a Soldier and a member of the US Army. He must ponder the repercussions of his decisions on his ethical standards as well as on the families of those Soldiers and Civilians who perished in the conflict. Pvt. Watt aptly perceives that the massacre embodies an act of excessive violence inflicted on others, notably Civilians. The US Soldiers perpetrated the killing of innocents, children, and mistreated this Civilian Family, more severely than any combatant and without respecting their dignity and life. This is a fundamental cause of a morally injurious experience.

The initial restoration/renovation measure that will assist Pvt. Watt in this scenario is establishing connections. He feels secluded and despised, receiving death threats for his decision. This is an incident that he likely keeps confidential for his own safety and feels that there is no one he can confide in. A connection should be fostered, most likely with other soldiers who have served, witnessed some form of similar MIEs targeted against Civilians or innocents, and who share similar perspectives and concerns. Trust and faith in humanity must be reinstated as a means of recovery, for the Soldier to realize that they are not isolated, and their decision was justified. Another fitting restoration measure is a conversation with a benevolent moral authority. The objective is for the Soldier to articulate the MIE and its impact on them and what they believe the repercussions on their life should be. This dialogue can be with a tangible individual or, if the person is religious, with God or a representative of God, such as a clergyman. The recipient of this conversation must not desire excessive suffering for the Soldier but rather lean towards forgiveness and restoration.

Throughout his service, Pvt. Watt encountered a morally injurious incident by being an indirect observer and investigator to his platoon comrades and friends perpetrating a dreadful massacre of innocents at Yusufiyah. This leads to psychological distress and places the Soldier in a morally conflicting situation. He should employ the rejuvenation resources of connection and dialogue with moral authority to assist in processing these occurrences.
