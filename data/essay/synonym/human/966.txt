Nowadays, there is a swift development of technologies in many areas of human life. Contemporary advancements' primary goal is enhancing a person's life convenient and secure. However, it is also crucial to consider the influence of human life on nature and the ecosystem. Consequently, the progression of electric vehicles offers additional comfort for mobility and positively impacts the environment. With the advancement of industry and traffic systems, one must recognize that human impact on nature has turned harmful. This is mainly due to the aftermath of the expansion of transportation, notably automobiles, which has raised concerns and the need for alternatives. Specifically, electric vehicles are gaining popularity as a substitute for internal combustion engines. Electric cars are more favorable for the future because of the lack of adverse effects on the environment since they do not emit harmful substances.

Carbon dioxide emissions, primarily caused by the widespread use of vehicles with internal combustion engines, have a detrimental effect on the environment. This is caused not just by air pollution but also by the destructive impact on the atmosphere. In turn, this affects the climate, particularly the rise in average temperature, as the atmospheric layers serve a protective role. Therefore, the technologies of electric vehicles are vital to the automotive industry and the consumer due to superior fuel efficiency and a beneficial environmental influence. In essence, electric cars will shield humanity from the dangers of warming-related catastrophes and assist in the economic aspect. Electric cars decrease fuel consumption, which will have a positive effect on the depletion of energy sources issue.

The primary argument for the necessity to substitute cars with internal combustion engines with electric ones is the level of vehicles' impact on the environment. Additionally, one must take into account the variety of engines and other kinds of vehicles: buses, trucks, and tractors. Passenger cars take the lead in terms of the number of units utilized, consequently having the most substantial impact. Furthermore, passenger cars surpass other forms of transportation in quantity, specifically airplanes, ships, and rail transport. Despite passenger cars mainly being used for journeys up to 200 kilometers, they still possess a notable level of negative impact. This is indicated by the large number of units used concurrently, leading to the accumulation of emissions.

All modes of transport, except for road transport, exhibit lower carbon dioxide emissions, with rail transport having the smallest share. As illustrated in Figure 1, road transportation accounts for 72% of overall emissions, with 60.7% attributed to automobiles (See Fig. 1 above). One can also observe that water and air transport have a relatively high emission share, albeit less compared to road transport. Hence, it can be deduced that transitioning from internal combustion engines to electric ones will substantially enhance the situation.

Regarding car-related concerns, one must contemplate the long-term consequences and outcomes. This comprises two facets: the impact on the environment and the utilization of natural resources. In recent years, there has been a notable escalation in oil extraction. This is primarily due to the heightened demand for gasoline derived from oil, which, in turn, is linked to the surge in the number of cars, particularly personal vehicles. In other words, one can foresee that the current indicators depicting the level of adverse impact on the environment might escalate. Therefore, the prospect of shifting to electric engines, at least in passenger cars, represents an effective solution to the issue in the long run. Simultaneously, it will influence the aforementioned aspects, namely the impact on nature and the resource utilization problem.

Electric cars possess another benefit in terms of consumables, energy conservation, and machine performance. It was ascertained that the technologies governing the operation of mechanisms in electric cars, which diminish the level of friction, could lower energy losses by 18-40%. This is connected with the operational principle of electric cars, specifically the reduction in the quality of pistons and levers, which wear out rapidly in conventional cars. By utilizing electricity, emissions and resource consumption for the construction of these components will be reduced.

It was also determined that electric cars hold an advantage over conventional cars concerning carbon dioxide emissions. Combustion engine cars emit 4.5 times more CO2 compared to electric cars. The substantial disparity in emissions is noteworthy, considering the quantity and utilization of modern vehicles. Moreover, the electricity used to charge electric cars may potentially originate solely from renewable energy sources in the future. Green energy, or energy produced from natural forces, negates the strain on existing resources. This encompasses energy derived from wind, water, tides, sunlight, as well as geothermal energy sourced from geothermal reserves.

Presently, there are inklings of transitioning to electricity not only in cars. Electric vehicle technology is applicable to locomotives, off-road vehicles (construction and mining vehicles), ships, and to some extent, aircraft. Certainly, the application of technologies not yet accessible to the public is necessary for such advancements. Nonetheless, this could become feasible in the future, leading to a revolution in energy utilization. Furthermore, it will significantly enhance the environmental condition by reducing emissions close to zero. This would resolve climate issues and ameliorate air quality, positively impacting human health and biodiversity. In essence, the adoption of electric transport presents local and overarching long-term benefits.

The adoption of electric engines will diminish the need for material processing and transport for fuel and gasoline extraction. Analogous to burning gasoline in car engines, the refining process of oil emits carbon dioxide. Additionally, a substantial amount of pollution in the world's oceans has been instigated by byproducts from oil refining and mishaps during oil or fuel transportation. Oil spills resulting from accidents have a devastating impact on oceanic flora and fauna. Moreover, it adversely affects marine microorganisms, leading to enduring negative repercussions. Furthermore, harmful substances deposited on the water surface due to fuel combustion during water transport also have adverse effects on water quality, flora, and fauna. Consequently, the transition to electric cars has a favorable impact not only on air quality, resource utilization, and energy but also on the world's oceans.

Reducing vehicle emissions worldwide will yield a significant positive influence on air quality, acid rain, smog, and climate change. The health implications of vehicle emissions are also a point of concern. Car noise is detrimental to individuals as it impacts not only hearing but also contributes to hypertension development. Carbon and nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons, and sulfur-containing compounds form the hazardous blend one encounters daily on city streets. Other environmental repercussions of road transport include traffic congestion and urban expansion encroaching on natural habitats and farmlands. The exhaust fumes from cars contain a substantial amount of lead, which, along with other metal salts, seeps into the soil, surface, and groundwater, being absorbed by plants. During the operation of cars with internal combustion engines, the sources of emissions of harmful substances are the exhaust gases and unregulated leakage of operational materials onto the ground.

In conclusion, electric cars offer a brighter future for numerous reasons, encompassing both local and overarching long-term causes. Current research and scientific endeavors provide grounds for the beneficial impact of electric cars on the environment and future livelihood. Furthermore, the transition to electric engines is feasible not only in cars, which contribute the most to emissions among transportation modes. Plans are underway to replace fuel with electricity in trains, ships, and airplanes. The disparity between the environmental and air impact of electric cars and combustion engine cars is substantial. Moreover, it will yield positive outcomes concerning energy utilization and natural resource conservation.
