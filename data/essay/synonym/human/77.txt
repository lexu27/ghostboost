When studying about faiths and ideologies, I discover that beginnings or backgrounds are crucial in interpreting the context and substance of a religion. For Jainism, it was crucial to understand that it is significantly older than a more well-known and contemporary Sikhism. Even though both have close connections with Hinduism, Sikhismâ€™s roots trace back to only about 500 years ago while Jainism has a history of nearly 2500 years (Molloy 191). Sikhism demonstrates a more warlike approach to monotheism despite being more contemporary. Accordingly, the Jainist conviction that no Creator exists and that the universe is simply directed by natural forces becomes particularly intriguing as it rejects a very traditional inclusion of deities into theology.

Subsequent to this, it is also fascinating to me to observe in what manners a religion engages with the world through its standpoint. As mentioned earlier, Jainism dismisses the faith in a Creator or God. This belief is supported by numerous philosophical inquiries that are even debated in atheistic circles. These involve inconsistencies in standard monotheistic religions such as God being both flawless and generating an imperfect world or God cherishing all life but still permitting suffering. Jainism even presents a rational paradox, which proposes that if everything in the universe had to be established, would God not also need to be established? This worldview is astonishingly modern and conceivably contentious for its time.

Morality is another critical constituent of any philosophy or belief system. Jainism establishes five distinct principles of morality which are Ahimsa (non-violence), Satya (truth), Astheya (non-stealing), Brahmacharya (chastity), and Aparigraha (non-possession). I am particularly intrigued by Ahimsa which is the nucleus of Jainist morality. This is because I opine that many religions pardon violence because of their convictions, which is fundamentally unethical to my principles. Jainism suggests that non-violence is a priority and thus unjustifiable.
