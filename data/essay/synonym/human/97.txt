In individuals diagnosed with Parkinson’s Disease (PD) (P), how efficient is bicycle exercise as physical activity (I) compared to routine care (C) in enhancing the stability or physical well-being of PD patients (O) when applied within a specific period (T)? The selected article for the examination is ‘Parkinson’s disease patients benefit from bicycling’ by Tiihonen et al. 2021.
The article’s summary starts by acknowledging PD patients’ challenges in managing their conditions. According to Tiihonen et al. (2021), they recognize and indicate that PD patients are negatively affected and can scarcely maintain stable movement independently. Therefore, the article aims to determine which bicycle exercise would most benefit individuals diagnosed with PD. Furthermore, the study would also identify which PD-related symptoms or conditions would improve with the anticipated bicycle exercise.
The summary introduces the reader to a systematic database literature search, both randomized control trials (RCT) and non-randomized control trials (NRCT), which are the methods used for evaluating the impact of bicycle riding on PD patients. Additionally, the summary quantifies various sources that were examined to reach the conclusions drawn after the cohort study. It is reported that out of 202 articles reviewed, about 22 were considered eligible studies with roughly 505 patients enduring the PD condition. Thus, I believe the information provided in this article summary is sufficient to offer an outline of the research to its audience.
The primary concern in this article’s introduction is the purposeful physical exercise and general physical activities that are utilized to alleviate the difficulties encountered by PD patients. According to Tiihonen et al. (2021), physical and general activities have been experimentally and scientifically validated to reduce both motor and cognitive symptoms among individuals diagnosed with PD. Consequently, exercise complements the standard pharmaceutical and surgical treatment of PD patients. The article also emphasizes the necessity for diverse physical exercise forms for patients facing PD conditions to aid in improving their condition and enhancing their quality of life.
As mentioned in this article’s introduction, little or minimal resources have been allocated to identifying beneficial physical activities crucial for enhancing patients’ needs and well-being. Therefore, bicycle riding is one such activity proposed by Tiihonen et al. (2021) to assist in enhancing PD patients’ conditions as more innovative forms and technologies are being developed concerning therapies for individuals grappling with PD conditions.
The article suggests that exercise-based training could boost functional mobility by utilizing improved strength, endurance, balance, and flexibility that support the effective performance of these groups. Tiihonen et al. (2021) acknowledge that there is no definitive research proving exercise as a complete remedy for the condition but could be viewed as a disease-modifying factor that aids in patients’ enhancements. Additionally, physical activities have been discovered to have neuroprotective effects on the brain. This study reports that in 2010, certain individuals experienced severe gait freezing due to riding bicycles (Tiihonen et al., 2021). Thus, physical activities offer potential benefits for individuals diagnosed with PD conditions.
According to Tiihonen et al. (2021), the research implemented a criterion for determining the eligibility of the sources they needed to examine the matter at hand. Initially, the review was pre-registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews. According to this investigation, only original reports utilizing quantitative measures to comprehend the effects of an intervention on PD patients were deemed valid. Studies involving recumbent, tandem, motorized, non-motorized, and stationary bicycle ergometers in defining bicycle exercise were also encompassed in this research. Moreover, studies involving hand pedaling instead of foot pedaling were also included in this investigation.
Studies that were excluded, for example, were those in which their primary outcome had no connection to the impact of bicycling on the physical health of PD patients. To gather the relevant data, PubMed databases for biomedical literature were searched for studies from 2010 to 2020 using keywords such as ‘Parkinson bicycle cycling.’ The studies were selected based on the publication year and author, study design and sample size, quantitative measures before and after treatment, demographic characteristics of the sample size, and intervention features.
All the studies were categorized and examined to validate the quality of the chosen sources and confirm the impact of the treatment size. In instances where multiple primary measures were involved, an appropriate measure for analysis was selected that best represented the rest of the outcomes accurately. The measure was labeled functional if it facilitated general movement and body mobility. Subsequently, secondary measures were evaluated, and their correlation to how bicycle cycling would impact the lives of PD patients was ascertained. The variables of interest included gait, walking capacity, speeds, tremors, and balance.
Some of the assessment tools used in this research were the 6-minutes walking test, Parkinson’s Diseases Questionnaire 39, MDS-Unified Parkinson’s Diseases rating scale (MDS-UPDRS) II and III, and Quality-of-life. This is a quantitative research approach as it entails the measurement of several variables that must be systematically analyzed to arrive at an informed conclusion regarding the matter under investigation.
According to Tiihonen et al. (2021), the duration of treatment varied from 1-12 weeks. Out of the 22 studies utilized, a small number of PD patients did not report bicycle cadence. Conversely, the majority of the studies reported cadence. The data gathered and presented from this research ultimately demonstrated that bicycle exercise is advantageous concerning PD patients. The study demonstrated motor enhancement with physical exercise. Additionally, interventions that were repeated more than once proved to yield superior outcomes in managing PD patients (Tiihonen et al., 2021). Therefore, the results of this study indicated that bicycling among PD individuals enhances their overall conditions and well-being. Furthermore, the effect size derived from the data suggests that bicycling offers numerous benefits in assisting diagnosed patients in coping with their conditions. The hypothesis was also validated that moderate to high-intensity physical exercise among the patients had a beneficial effect compared to low-intensity training. Lastly, the research also indicated that the patients’ ability to balance improved with bicycling among PD patients.
This study aids readers and the general public in comprehending Parkinson’s Disease more comprehensively. Furthermore, the investigation provides further details regarding the causes, risk factors, and how diagnosed patients can be managed to instill hope in their daily lives. One coping strategy outlined by the study is bicycling, considered a physical activity through which patients with PD are encouraged to enhance their condition. Finally, the research reaffirms the significance of caring for PD patients.
