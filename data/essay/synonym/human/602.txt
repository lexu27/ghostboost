The worldwide outbreak instigated by the COVID-19 has resulted in serious issues in the workforce. To be more specific, the quantity of jobless individuals is significantly higher than before the global lockdown (The Economist, para. 2). Naturally, such a circumstance occurred due to companies going insolvent or decreasing the number of workers to endure the economic crisis. The Economist details the data on the jobless rate and discloses the duration it can take for the workforce to bounce back to its pre-pandemic condition (para. 1-3). This problem is intricate, so McConnell et al. address the main facets that contribute to it in chapters 12, 15, and 18. The 12th chapter uncovers the governmental reaction to the labor market and how it is managed during a crisis or similar situations (McConnell et al.). The 15th segment indicates the specifics of job searching, which is pertinent to the subject, given that individuals failed to secure a job because of the serious economic circumstance (McConnell et al.). Lastly, the final chapter encompasses the examination of employment and joblessness and how they impact the labor market as a whole. The economist, Gary Becker, received the Nobel Prize for exceptional contributions to the field of economy, applying the theories for human behavior to link the idea to sociology, criminology, and even demography. He studied the motivations for actors’ behavior, striving for greater wealth, acknowledgment, and reputation, to scrutinize how this psychological phenomenon relates to investments and crime (The Nobel Prize, para. 2). The most notable part of Becker’s contribution is his exploration of the connection of the aforementioned idea to bias in the job market in relation to individuals of other professions.
