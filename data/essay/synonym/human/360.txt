Various situations in which medical personnel has operated resulted in different kinds of leadership approaches being formulated. For instance, the COVID-19 pandemic emphasized the importance of clear communication and the management of timely readiness in top healthcare leaders (Nicola et al., 2020). Another crucial maneuver involves the utilization of external change agents that ultimately foster outstanding organizational decision-making (Alagoz et al., 2018). Additionally, one research elucidated how implementing positivity-related and open-minded methods as leaders can enhance their employees' resilience, providing an extra source of motivation (Wei et al., 2018). Therefore, efficient healthcare leaders must adjust to diverse external changes and strategically communicate with their colleagues.
Several divisions can be engaged with through the role of a healthcare executive. One of them involves the in-patient department where multiple approaches from adept professionals are required. Furthermore, critical care and A&E demand exceptional administration and collaborative opportunities. As previously stated, the chosen healthcare areas are prime illustrations of sectors necessitating strong leaders to deliver optimal patient care. One approach to enhance this is through a comprehensive method that considers external and internal factors. Moreover, collaborative decision-making should not be perceived as constraining to effective leadership; conversely, it presents an ideal tactic in healthcare management.
The significance of interprofessional collaboration in medical institutions is apparent through its impact on patient outcomes. Studies have shown notable changes in healthcare conditions after the execution of the approach (Spaulding et al., 2018). The technique involves acquiring knowledge from colleagues and integrating it into one's practice, seeking advice from the respective medical personnel. Consequently, the approach influences the array of services professionals can provide to their patients and should be further developed to enhance its practicality.
