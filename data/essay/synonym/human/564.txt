It should be observed that drivers should not be permitted to use handheld gadgets when their vehicle is stationary at a red light. The driving procedure is highly demanding of one’s focus, which implies that any type of diversion is a hazard. Handheld gadgets are distracting, and consequently, drivers lose sight and concentration of the road and signals of movement. Therefore, handheld gadgets should be prohibited for drivers at all times because halting at red lights also necessitates drivers’ focus. The red light indication is a crucial component of road safety and efficient movement, particularly at intersections. The State of Georgia enforced a statute, which “renders it unlawful for drivers to “physically hold or support, with any part of his or her body,” a wireless telecommunications device” (Dyke and Smith, para. 2). Only exemptions to the regulation comprise making “calls to report a traffic accident, criminal activity, medical emergency, or hazardous condition” (Dyke and Smith, para 3). However, the red light indication is a vital aspect of road safety, which does not negate the requirement for a driver’s focus. A study proposes that “phone use during driving causes decrease in situation awareness and delays response to the events happening in driving environment which may lead to accidents” (Choudhary and Velaga 351). In other words, drivers will be sluggish to react to light changes from red indication to green one. This will result in unnecessary delays in the traffic movement. In conclusion, based on the proof given above, drivers should not be permitted to use their handheld gadgets during the red light signal since concentration on the road is needed even during the stop. The postponed response time might lead to unnecessary traffic and congestion. These elements heighten the risk of accidents because not all drivers will be reacting to changes in light signals simultaneously.
