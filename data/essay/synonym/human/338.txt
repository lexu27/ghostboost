The predicament of unauthorized termination of life sparks various discussions. From a religious perspective, this issue presents multiple drawbacks, with the primary one being the committing of a significant transgression against God, the giver of life. Furthermore, the adverse effects of euthanasia include the depreciation of human life, infringement of people's equality under the law, medical obligations, and the dynamics of the doctor-patient bond. Consequently, it can be inferred that the proliferation of euthanasia's acceptance will result in a complete erosion and reorganization of the human values system. This article scrutinizes the scenario involving George, who has been struck by a severe ailment that will ultimately incapacitate him entirely. Due to the pessimistic sentiments overwhelming him and the realization of the ailment's incurable nature, he contemplates resolving the issue through euthanasia. Therefore, employing literary sources, a scholarly document scrutinizes the issue of deliberate death and religious reflections.

In the contemporary era, notwithstanding the fairly progressive progress in medicine, individuals encounter illnesses that regrettably do not respond to any therapies. In such instances, the impact of the ailment, both physically and mentally, can be arduous to endure. Owing to the apprehension of losing autonomy and dignity, individuals ponder euthanasia or, in other words, voluntary self-destruction. Nonetheless, this stance conflicts with God's endeavors to revive the Christian faith. Therefore, this academic manuscript delves into a thematic exploration concerning an individual who has relinquished hope and is contemplating euthanasia.

The case study, which serves as the foundation of this research article, narrates the tale of a middle-aged individual, George. He maintains an ordinary lifestyle, is employed, spends time with his kin, and dedicates time to his personal pursuits. Nevertheless, one day, he starts experiencing muscle frailty and a decline in muscle coordination. Subsequently, he sustains an injury, and upon consulting a physician, receives an unsatisfactory diagnosis. Following further examinations, George is diagnosed with a severe and dreadful malady known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). This ailment manifests as the malfunction of the brain's nerve cells responsible for muscle and spinal cord functions (Westeneng et al., 2018). The most renowned individual with this condition is the esteemed scientist Stephen Hawking (Westeneng et al., 2018). The disorder culminates in the complete immobilization of an individual, yet senses such as smell, touch, vision, hearing, and taste persist.
George was informed that ALS currently lacks a cure, and its progression can solely be mitigated by specific medications; however, scientists have yet to discover means to halt the ailment. This revelation can induce profound shock and despondency, triggering intense negative emotions and bewilderment. This sequence of events unfolded for George, who dreaded the prospect of relying on a wheelchair and burdening his family members with fulfilling his essential needs. The notion of dependency and forfeiting command over his own body left him restless, prompting contemplation of easing his family's burden by resorting to euthanasia.
The issue of euthanasia's utilization is pressing in contemporary society. In the United States of America, this practice has been legalized in nine jurisdictions (Hoehner, 2001). Advocates of this deliberate termination of life assert that it spares individuals prolonged agony leading up to death due to advancements in medical technologies (Orr, 2001). Nonetheless, the prevalence of this form of demise could escalate medical expenses for patients' families since, owing to the low rate of legalization, euthanasia proves to be a costly service. Conversely, Christianity opposes euthanasia. For this belief system, the paramount emphasis is on the fact that the end-of-life phase is characterized by love, compassion, reconciliation, and care, all of which euthanasia strips away from an individual.
The primary issue concerning euthanasia from the Christian perspective is the transgression against God's decree. Consequently, the Christian doctrine underscores that God bestows life upon individuals and determines when it should be relinquished. Euthanasia implies that patients dictate the timing of their demise, akin to one of the religion's cardinal sins - suicide. Despite the fact that a medical professional administers a specific drug in euthanasia cases rather than the patient directly, the responsibility for the decision rests with the patient in such instances. Sources underscore that "Doctors may assist their patients in experiencing a dignified demise from natural causes, but they should not end their patients' lives or aid in their self-destruction" (Anderson, 2015, p. 1). Consequently, this act is also deemed sinful by religion since it can be construed as premeditated homicide, that is, deciding to end another person's life.
Furthermore, scholarly literature posits several key rationales against supporting euthanasia. One such rationale is the introduction of jeopardy for the vulnerable and defenseless. Moreover, assigning the physician the responsibility of ending someone's life can severely strain the doctor-patient relationship. Additionally, it is imperative to highlight the disruption of familial relationships and the contravention of core tenets such as human dignity and legal equality (Anderson, 2015). Aligning with the Christian standpoint, individuals should refrain from aiding others in self-annihilation but instead furnish the requisite level of care and support to alleviate and instill tranquility in the patient's life.
On one hand, viewed through the Christian narrative, George's trials can be construed, as previously mentioned, with an emphasis on the world's sinful nature. This stems from the classification of euthanasia as suicide, which religion deems unjustifiable. Conversely, the dread of losing control over one's life in the future and the erosion of dignity significantly impact the patient. When considering the hope of resurrection, the man's experiences can be interpreted as a yearning for a swift reunion with the divine. Hence, George may harbor reluctance to be perceived as a burden by his family in this world, and to some extent, his motivations can be comprehended.
The Christian ideology extols human life as the utmost valuable asset. When turning to religion, an individual comprehends the sinful nature of contemplating self-annihilation since that prerogative belongs to God. Consequently, George's perspective on living with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis may undergo a transformation. To assuage the patient's qualms, redirecting his thoughts toward a more positive trajectory becomes imperative. Thus, underscoring his significance to his family and the invaluable moments shared with them until his passing becomes essential.
Moreover, in light of the aforementioned, the Christian faith repudiates the practice of euthanasia as it contradicts the core values and principles of religion. Firstly, the sanctity of an individual's life, divinely bestowed upon them, is compromised (Reese, 2019). Secondly, euthanasia is deemed voluntary self-destruction, constituting one of the most severe and egregious human transgressions. Thirdly, the propagation and normalization of this practice can undermine the notion that life is precious and that individuals are obligated to uphold each other's will to persevere.
Hence, it can be deduced that there exist no grounds for justifying the act of intentional life termination within the Christian framework. The factors enumerated earlier fortify this argument. From my perspective, I view euthanasia as a facile solution to challenges
