Preamble
Over the timeline of the United States, the nation was the predominant direction for emigration from Latin America. Hispanic and Latino migrants from varied nations started to arrive in the U.S. prior to the commencement of the Gold Rush. In the ensuing centuries, the surge of Hispanic migrants to the nation grew considerably. This manuscript will explore the circumstances of Hispanic emigration to the U.S. and the causes that prompted the migration of the discussed populations. Additionally, diverse perspectives on Hispanic migration and its impact on the nation, including the current influence, will be scrutinized.
Chronicle of Hispanic Migration
The Gold Rush
Despite the Hispanic minority existing on the land of the United States since the addition of Florida and Louisiana, the initial significant migration began after the finish of the U.S.-Mexican War. The conclusion of the war coincided with the revelation of gold in California and resulted in the initial substantial influx of Latino migrants to the U.S. (D. Gutiérrez). Moreover, the treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo signed in 1848 culminated in the cession of the territories of California, Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, and Utah from Mexico to the United States (Gregory). Consequently, the Hispanic individuals residing in these states were naturalized as U.S. citizens, and numerous Mexican migrants arrived in California to toil in the gold mines. Overall, the majority of Hispanic migrants to the U.S. in the latter half of the 19th century were Mexican.
First Half of the 20 th Century
The migration from Latin American nations to the United States persisted during the 20th century. In the first half of the century, Mexicans constituted the bulk of the Hispanic migrants to the nation, with a minor fraction of immigrants from the Caribbean nations. The influx of migrants can be clarified by the acceleration of the agricultural sector in the U.S. and the necessity for seasonal farmworkers (R. Gutiérrez 3). Despite many Latino immigrants being expelled during this time, the government summoned Mexican laborers to work in the defense industries and the agricultural sector due to the labor shortage induced by the Second World War (Gregory). Therefore, the subsequent wave of Hispanic migration was characterized by the demand for laborers.
Second Half of the 20 th Century
In the latter half of the 20th century, the Hispanic migration to the U.S. became more varied. Migrants from Puerto Rico and Cuba were sanctioned to enter the nation as the former were classified as U.S. citizens, while the latter were conferred the status of refugees due to Cuba being a Communist nation (Gregory). Migrants from other Latin American nations were scarcer due to reduced quotas for the number of individuals permitted in the U.S. granted to them.
Grounds for Migration and Migration Circumstances
The causes for Hispanic migrants to journey to the United States are diverse. Nonetheless, it can be contended that the economic motive was and remains most notable. The nation proffered high salaries for unskilled labor that compared favorably with the wages tendered for the same labor in the Latin American and Caribbean nations (Sánchez-Alonso 11). In contrast to Mexico, Puerto Rico, Cuba, and other lands, the United States offered more prospects for migrants from those nations. Additionally, various political incidents, such as the Mexican Revolution, contributed to numerous individuals being uprooted and relocating to a secure nation (D. Gutiérrez). The majority of Hispanic migrants chose to relocate to the United States for economic motives.
It should be emphasized that a substantial proportion of immigrants moved to the U.S. as spouses or children of American citizens. In the initial waves of migration, spouses frequently arrived in the nation jointly. However, most women worked in the household, with under 20% of Hispanic female migrants securing roles outside it, mainly in the domestic and personal service sector (R. Gutiérrez 8). Subsequently, the migration trend altered to male migrants arriving in the nation first to seek employment and establish themselves in the United States before their families could join them. Thus, legislation permitted legal spouses, minor children, and parents of adult U.S. citizens to relocate to the nation (R. Gutiérrez 15). Overall, the conditions of Hispanic individuals migrating to the United States transformed significantly over history.
Perspectives on Hispanic Migration to the U.S.
The Hispanic migration to the nation was a contentious subject, and individuals with distinct viewpoints perceived the matters differently. During the Gold Rush and the initial half of the 20th century, Hispanic migrants were frequently marginalized and discriminated against due to their ethnicity (R. Gutiérrez 22). Nevertheless, employers considered migrants vital to maximize profits (R. Gutiérrez 22). In 1965, the Hart-Celler Act was enacted to prevent discrimination and better consider immigrants entering the U.S. from varied nations, impacting numerous ethnic minorities (R. Gutiérrez 14). Although the act governs the admission and stay of individuals in the nation, it is frequently contended that the act normalizes and decriminalizes the anti-Mexican laws that are overlooked when there is a demand for seasonal laborers (R. Gutiérrez 22). In the past two decades, opinions on immigration witnessed minimal alteration, with the Republicans regarding it as a substantial menace, while the democrats hold a more moderate stance on it (Hammer and Kafura 2). Overall, the stance on Hispanic migration predominantly remained unfavorable since the initial arrival of immigrants during the Californian Gold Rush.
Implication of Hispanic Migration to the U.S.
Consequence of Migration throughout the History of the Nation
Throughout the history of the United States, Hispanic migration chiefly influenced the nation’s economy. During the Gold Rush, the Hispanic populace mainly consisted of Mexican migrants, who were involved in various economic sectors, encompassing the gold, copper, and coal industries (R. Gutiérrez 5). One of the most notable contributions of the small Hispanic communities was their labor on the railroads and irrigation systems in the West of the U.S. (R. Gutiérrez 5). It should be noted that the labor of the Hispanic community faced fewer restrictions from government policies and regulations than other migrant groups. At the commencement of the 20th century, authorized and unauthorized Mexican immigrants constituted the majority of seasonal agricultural laborers in the southwest of the United States (R. Gutiérrez 8). Moreover, during the 1940s, due to the mobilization of the American populace, the U.S. government instituted a guest worker program with Mexico, Puerto Rico, Cuba, and other Latin American nations (D. Gutiérrez; Gregory). Since the onset of the Hispanic inflow to the nation, migrants have become indispensable in the labor market.
The influx of Hispanic migrants and immigrants from other nations also resulted in the formulation and establishment of different policies and government agencies. For instance, the arrival of immense numbers of Hispanic and Asian individuals into the U.S. through the Mexican border prompted the establishment of the U.S. Border Patrol in 1924 (R. Gutiérrez 7). Additionally, Hispanic migration contributed to a shift in the demographic composition of the United States. Overall, the Hispanic migration to the United States significantly influenced the nation’s development, legislation, and
