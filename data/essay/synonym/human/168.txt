Historically, jurisprudence was established on the necessity to ensure citizens’ safety, possession, and health and to protect the people from civil disorder and crime. As such, Harris (2020) illustrates that jurisprudence's lawful powers included utilizing force legitimized by the government or apprehensions through a monopoly on violence. In its primitive system, jurisprudence clan members united to enforce rules of the group on rogue members. The intention behind enforcing societal directives, performing human control, and empowering authoritative enforcement of those rules was to protect the people from rogue members.
The community believed that any form of violence against any of them was equivalent to an attack on the rest (Harris, 2020). Therefore, to accomplish its purpose, early jurisprudence utilized three fundamental characteristics, no coercion, jurisprudence had a wide array of tasks. The third characteristic was a crucial differentiation between the people legally endowed with policing responsibilities and those who carried out policing duties.
Peace offices have the mandate of ensuring that whether on or off duty, they shall not commit any crime knowingly under the country’s laws. In the U.S., for instance, peace officers are bound by local and state jurisdiction not to commit a crime. The other responsibilities of the peace officer are to not knowingly disobey the rule of law on criminal procedures, especially in such areas as detention, arrests, evidence preservation, and the use of informants (Schroeder & Lombardo, 2018). Moreover, no peace officer shall surpass their authority when enforcing the law, and no individual freedom shall be restricted by peace officers (Schroeder & Lombardo, 2018). Only except the law is police officers allowed to disobey the rule of law relative to the criminal procedures.
