Environmental Aspect

Ensuring the security of an infant becomes the primary and most crucial duty of parents. Particularly in the initial year of life, the infant is incapable of shielding itself from detrimental environmental elements. Instances of such damaging impacts could include air and water contamination, excessive sunlight exposure, or dirt and chemicals. This study examines the detrimental environmental elements for an infant under one year old and proposes health enhancement to shield newborns from harm.

Sources stress that in 2012, nearly two million children under the age of five globally perished due to the environment (“Children’s environmental health,” n.d.). The reasons were respiratory infections, malaria, and various wounds and injuries. The most perilous aspect is that once endured, illnesses and wounds can impact the child’s subsequent growth and development in adolescents.

The primary environmental element is air and water contamination.

Adverse environmental consequences and pollution significantly influence sickness, incapacity, and in some instances, death. Therefore, among the facets implicated in this element are air contamination, insufficient water, and harmful chemicals and waste that also contaminate everything. Among the hazards are “lower-respiratory infections, diarrheal diseases, brain damage and inflammation, blood disorders, and jaundice” (“Air Pollution,” n.d., para. 2). Air pollution can be risky during the mother’s pregnancy since already at this stage, the infant’s health will deteriorate. In addition to chemicals, there may also be harmful particles of dirt and dust in the air, which can enter the infant’s body through the respiratory tract.

Polluted water or absence of clean water for the infant and family can be very severe. This issue is particularly acute in developing nations, where people’s access to water resources can be severely restricted. It is important to note that infants are given water only on the recommendation of a doctor in the first months of pregnancy. However, water plays a crucial role in the operation of the infant’s body and must fulfill specific criteria to ensure safety. Minimal repercussions can be poisoning or allergies, which can evolve into more severe ailments.

Another element of detrimental effects on the infant during the initial few years that are associated with environmental pollution is harmful chemicals and trash. This is because infants start to explore the world around them after gaining the ability to move. Hence, one of the methods to get acquainted with the new is through touch and taste testing. Therefore, there is a chance of encountering substances that may be scattered on the ground. Instances may be chemical poisoning or skin burn. Precisely the same characteristics are found in trash, which can jeopardize the health of the infant and impact the subsequent development of the body.

Health Enhancement Scheme

This section of the scientific paper presents a health enhancement plan that can offer knowledge for caregivers on how to avert and shield newborns from environmental risk.
Monitor what the infant is doing both at home and on the street
Carry out water filtration before use with the aid of specific filters. An alternative might be the purchase of bottled water, which will be designated for infants.
If feasible, evade locations where there is a high level of air and water contamination near factories and production.

In other words, it is crucial to uphold the necessary air quality, which is dictated by the absence of surplus gases, dirt, and odors. To achieve this, it is vital to ensure constant ventilation in the room and maintain a moisture equilibrium to restrict the occurrence of mold detrimental to the infant. All these measures are due to the fact that infants have a high respiratory rate and a larger lung surface area in proportion to their body weight. Due to the more rapid and intensive immune system development, they are most susceptible to external environmental elements.
Ensure adherence to hygiene standards, which also extend to being on the street or in a public place.
To prevent poisoning with toxic substances, it is essential to thoroughly wash vegetables and fruits before offering them to an infant.
Evade tobacco smoke and the smoke from burning items.
Consultation with the attending pediatrician is essential regarding what actions should be taken in emergencies and the fundamentals that are crucial to guarantee the safety of the infant’s health.

This article raises the subject of such peril for infants and the increasing prevalence of sudden infant death syndrome. This is influenced by multiple external and internal elements, such as the high vulnerability of the body, the negative impact of environmental elements, and exogenous stress, such as sleeping on the stomach or a soft bed, during a critical period of development (Carlin & Moon, 2017). The source is a valuable resource for highlighting recommendations for infant care. Thus, caregivers should attend to aspects such as proper sleep, a bed for the infant, soft bedding, tobacco smoke restriction, cohabitation, and immunization.

This source provides information and recommendations in the event of encountering air pollution. This issue poses a threat to the health of society, particularly to children. Due to the elevated level of urbanization, more and more infants are exposed to polluted air from vehicles and various industrial plants. The source accentuates the significance of formulating strategies aimed at preventing the adverse effects of pollution on children’s health (Gouveia et al., 2018). Furthermore, caregivers should pay special attention to airing the premises and avoiding the close proximity of the infant to sources of polluted air. The information provided in the scientific paper can also aid in monitoring changes in health effects due to strategic interventions.

One of the issues that external elements can lead to is growth retardation in infants, which will have notably severe consequences in adulthood. This health issue can exacerbate in the initial few years of a child’s life. The authors state that “climate change will cause significantly more stunting through a reduction of food security” (2018, p. 551). This source offers recommendations and generalizations on environmental risk elements that were associated with growth retardation. Hence, if there is a threat, it is crucial to implement measures to fortify the health of infants, including steps to enhance nutrition and care for the condition of the room in which the child is situated.
