Clark, Nancy L. “Gendering production in wartime South Africa.” The American Historical Review 106, no. 4 (2001): 1181-1213.
Clark’s subject is the impact of World War II on the autonomy of South Africa. The central idea is that historians are confined in their comprehension of the connection between the Second World War and African autonomy. The approach is the examination of historical documents portraying the era of World War II. This is a paper on history with a substantial inclusion of women’s studies. The writer depends on declarations, memoranda, and other documents to display factual information. The primary assertion of the writer is that South Africa’s history during and promptly after World War II is inadequately researched. The writer’s aim is to exhibit the distinctiveness of South Africa’s economic and political progress among African nations. There is a clear bias against political powers that established apartheid.
The article is remarkable for its focus on details discovered in aged documents. Clark herself recognizes the restriction that minimal research exists that validates her perspective. Nevertheless, the article is beneficial in that it demonstrates the uncertainty of South Africa’s social patterns as opposed to The Impact of World War II and Mwanikii’s article, which are notably one-sided. The article will aid in responding to the research question by highlighting the distinctiveness of South Africa’s post-war years compared to other African nations.
Grundlingh, Albert. “The King’s Afrikaners? Enlistment and ethnic identity in the Union of South Africa’s Defence Force during the Second World War, 1939–45.” The Journal of African History 40, no. 3 (1999): 351-365.
Grundlingh’s subject is the function of South Africa in World War II. His central argument is that South Africa’s historiography does not accurately depict the country’s efforts during the war. Grundlingh’s work is a paper on history, with a definite military focus. The writer scrutinizes prior historical books, articles, and military reports. The primary concept of the text is that Afrikaners who enlisted in the Allied effort during World War II had a noteworthy influence on Afrikaner ethnicity. Grundlingh’s objective is to dispel the public misapprehension that South Africa did not engage in the Second World War due to nationalistic resistance. Some bias against Western historians can be observed in Grundlingh’s portrayal of current assumptions about South Africa in the early forties.
The paper’s potency is the abundance of proof of Afrikaners’ involvement in military endeavors. The article’s drawback is that the writer does not suggest any alternative means of affirming his hypothesis other than accepting his interpretation. The article is beneficial because it highlights military endeavors of Afrikaners, which are not addressed by any other sources. The article’s comprehensive depiction of South Africa’s military involvement in World War II will offer invaluable insights for addressing the research question.
Smith, Jean P. “Race and hospitality: Allied troops of colour on the South African home front during the Second World War.” War & Society 39, no. 3 (2020): 155-170.
Smith’s subject is the significance of South Africa during World War II as a transport hub for Allies. The central argument is that South Africa functioned as a crucial hub for training and transportation, which significantly contributed to the military endeavor. The article is a work on history, with some insight from social science. Smith utilizes evidence from memoirs, governments’ reports, and books portraying South Africa during World War II. The primary concept of the article is that South Africa’s reception of the Allies’ forces indicated substantial complexity concerning racial segregation in the country. The aim of the paper is to identify social subtleties, which became particularly significant while South Africa hosted the Allies’ military forces. It can be argued that the writer is biased by the contemporary understanding of racial issues.
The paper’s strength is the comparatively new perspective on the relationship between Afrikaners and Allied military. The paper’s weak point is that the writer assumes the affirmative nature of the relationship by labeling it as hospitality, which was likely more nuanced. The article further continues Clark’s and Grundlingh’s trend of emphasizing South Africa’s role in World War II, which directly relates to the research question.
Teer-Tomaselli, Ruth. “In service of empire: The South African broadcasting corporation during World War II.” Critical Arts 28, no. 6 (2014): 879-904.
Teer-Tomaselli’s subject is the alterations in the mass media rhetoric during World War II in South Africa. The writer’s central argument is that World War II altered the messages conveyed my mass media, which would eventually lead to social, economic, and political transformation if South Africa. The approach employed by the writer consists of the analysis of news companies’ reports and Debates of the House of the Assembly. The paper is chiefly a study of mass media in the context of World War II. The primary notion that Teer-Tomaselli advances is that news coverage of World War II triggered changes in public perception, which would eventually lead to the downfall of British rule in South Africa.
The writer’s intent is to highlight the influence of mass media in shifting the narrative. No evident biases are apparent as Teer-Tomaselli presents facts with minimal personal opinion. The text’s strength is its reliance on state documents to support the writer’s argument. The paper’s weakness is that no real interpretation of qualitative is provided. This piece is valuable because it is the only source that addresses the role of mass media. Understanding the role of the mass media is beneficial in addressing the overall research question.
Mwanikii. “The Unspoken Contributions of South Africa in WWII,” Medium .
The subject is the necessity of acknowledgment of South Africa’s contribution to the Allies during World War II. The writer’s central argument is that the recognition of the role of Western powers in World War II should also encompass South Africa’s contribution. The author analyzes excerpts from a history book and scholarly journal article, both of which are dedicated to South Africa’s involvement in the World War II. Although the article’s focus is history, it is essentially an opinion piece. The main idea is that South Africa’s contribution enabled Western nations to secure victory, which is not adequately acknowledged by modern historiography.
The writer’s goal is to acquaint the audience with the fundamental facts known about Afrikaners’ involvement in World War II. The writer openly expresses his prejudice against Western historiography’s coverage of World War II. This opinion piece is valuable because it succinctly highlights basic facts about South Africa during World War II.
