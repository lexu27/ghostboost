Social networking has become an essential part of the contemporary world, given that many individuals choose to utilize these platforms to engage with others. Personally, I favor utilizing Facebook as it is not swamped with spam and promotions as extensively as Instagram, Tik Tok, or similar applications. I use Facebook to communicate with my former acquaintances, whom I can no longer see because they relocated to other cities or even countries, so this social platform appears to be an ideal choice to connect with them occasionally. Nonetheless, popular social networking applications seem to have impacted today’s society as individuals are consistently exposed to hostility, adverse remarks or publications, and counterfeit influencers.
To explain further, the theory of impression management has become tangible as individuals strive to present their superior selves merely to create a favorable impression on individuals they encounter online. This counterfeit image on social networking can damage an individual’s self-assurance as individuals may feel insecure compared to the influencers’ or supermodels’ material on social platforms. Goffman’s theory on social interaction is also evident in the contemporary world, given that individuals tend to swiftly terminate connections with individuals who appear to be of no advantage to them (Barbalet, 2020). Based on the aforementioned ideas, it is evident that social networking nowadays is entirely artificial and harmful to users as it deteriorates their mental well-being and self-assurance.
Nevertheless, the multitude of social networking platforms offers numerous alternatives for users since each application is utilized for distinct intentions. For example, Tik Tok is predominantly used to swap amusing videos with friends, while Twitter is a public journal where one can express viewpoints on crucial subjects or not as much to the followers. Consequently, it is evident that the communication approach among users differs on various social networking platforms. In general, the choices provided by the applications can also restrict the forms of interaction as, for instance, individuals can utilize some media solely for messaging and others for video calling or recording voice messages.
