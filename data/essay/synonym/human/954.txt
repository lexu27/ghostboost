The frequency of patient deaths in intensive care is a mounting worry for medical professionals. Although the reason for patient motionlessness may be linked to various factors even before the individual arrives at the CCU, it has been noted that an efficient tube positioning during resuscitation supports healthy circulation. It is unclear whether the nurse’s understanding of capnography influences its utilization in critical care units. The aim of this endeavor is to assess the correlation between nurses’ comprehension of capnography and its application in coronary care units. The initiative will offer valuable perspective into elements impacting the utilization of capnography, thereby contributing to the domain and addressing the void in the literature. The intervention procedure will educate nurses on the advantage of capnography and evaluate their implementation in critical care units. Through the training and assessment, the objective is to promote the incorporation of capnography utilization in the chosen CCU. The intervention will also allow precise tube positioning to encourage regular chest circulation during resuscitation, enhance the delivery of quality care, and aid in patient recovery in critical care units. The initiative will enroll nurses operating in the designated coronary care unit in Central Jersey. This location was selected due to the high frequency of nurse’s resistance to using capnography during resuscitation. The project schedule spans twenty-four weeks. The chosen participants will be selected based on the inclusion criteria, and their test outcomes will be confidential and solely utilized for evaluating nursing understanding of capnography. This endeavor will support favorable health results by furnishing proof to endorse nursing practice in incorporating capnography during resuscitation.
