Helmed by the American movie producer and filmmaker Martin Scorsese, The Irishman is a 2019 movie that narrates the tale of the standard operations and existence of members of gang families and groups in the mid-20th century. The movie is adapted from Charles Brandt’s 2004 novel I Hear You Paint Houses. Specifically, the film is based on the recollections of Frank Sheeran, an elderly Irish-American man who served in the Second World War before becoming a hired killer for the Mafia groups in America. Sheeran, while residing in a nursing home, recounts the occurrences during his tenure as a hitman in the 1950s and beyond. Drawing from his recollections, the movie illustrates the incidents that enveloped the operations, relationships, and lives of the gang families during that era. Throughout the film, the director employs various cinematic techniques to narrate the story and create significance. Symbols are extensively utilized in the movie to establish meaning in different scenes and situations. Likewise, the movie depicts the application of the cinematic technique, with arrangement, camera, outfits, effects, hair and makeup, set design, and color employed to narrate the story from Sheeran’s narratives.
Symbols are crucial tools for conveying significance in various aspects of human existence and associations. As the theory of semiotics suggests, movies utilize symbols to denote or communicate meanings through the various elements that humans customarily utilize. Vocabulary, body language, motions, images, letters, and visual depictions are some of the diverse methods that humans employ to convey messages. Combinations of these symbols aid filmmakers in effectively conveying meanings and messages.
Similar to most contemporary films, The Irishman showcases the utilization of these symbols along with codes and customs to convey meaning in the same manner that words and languages are utilized to construct meaning in communication. In the gas station scene where Sheeran initially encounters Russel Bufalino, there are some symbols indicating that he is not meeting an ordinary businessman but a sharp, sly, and perilous individual. Bufalino’s body language, when elucidating the mechanical problem concerning Sheeran’s car, hints at a member of the Mafia, but Sheeran is oblivious at that moment. Here, Bufalino informs Sheeran, “you are back in business, kid” (The Irishman), yet Sheeran is around 56 years old and nearly the same age as Bufalino. These words, when scrutinized profoundly, symbolize that Bufalino holds a position of authority somewhere and leads an influential faction. Furthermore, the prompt manner in which Bufalino resolves the mechanical issue in Sheeran’s truck is a symbol suggesting his astuteness and capacity to lead, traits that are apparent later in the movie.
Likewise, in the Friendly Lounge setting where Sheeran encounters Skinny Razor Dutillio, certain symbols indicate the different kind of business that the group engages in. Sheeran is delivering meat to the inn owned by Dutillio. During their interaction, Skinny Razor’s body language signifies that he is a tough individual not just in business but possibly in other aspects of life. For example, he alters his expression and gazes directly into Sheeran’s eyes when a delivery person informs him, “I supply steak… the best steak” (The Irishman). As though implying something else, Skinny Razor looks straight into Sheeran’s eyes and questions, “you do?” (The Irishman) and then glances at the others and chuckles slightly as if he is disinterested in the business. Instead of discussing the business, Skinny Razor informs Sheeran that they will converse later. All these words and body language suggest that he is uninterested in the meat business, but perhaps involved in a different kind of enterprise. Additionally, there is a background melody playing during the encounter. When Sheeran exits the Friendly Lounge, a background music plays with the lyrics, “you better go back to your used-to-be place” (The Irishman). These lyrics symbolize the likelihood that the encounter will lead Sheeran to a different kind of life that is unfavorable.
Moreover, in the same scene, a flashback exhibits Dutillio back in 1945. Here, the audience is exposed to the sort of brutality that will likely ensue and dominate the narrative. A symbol of a razor blade utilized to ruthlessly slash the neck of a chicken is quite alarming. Dutillio employs a straight razor to sever the chicken’s neck and immediately blood splatters onto his face. The sadistic Dutillio wears a satisfied expression on his bloodied face, demonstrating signs of cruelty. The blood also splashes onto the walls and the laborers continue their tasks as usual. These aspects are employed as symbols to signify the kind of individuals that Sheeran will be dealing with and their characters. Dutillio is a sadist and violent individual who is prepared to murder individuals as a hitman for hire. The splattered blood on the wall signifies the meaning of the metaphor “painting houses,” which is utilized in the movie to denote the work of hitmen executing people for payment.
During the subsequent meeting, once more in the Friendly Lounge, the filmmaker uses additional symbols to indicate that the two men have previously met and conducted business together. Unlike the initial encounter, the subsequent meeting is relatively relaxed and both Sheeran and Dutillio exhibit body languages that signify their camaraderie. Both men are seated at the table consuming steaks, indicating that they have engaged in business together. It symbolizes that Sheeran has joined the group and is part of the transactions typical with the Mafia in the underground market. The audience later discovers that Sheeran was pilfering meat from his employer to supply it to Dutillio and other members of the gang at a lower cost, enabling them to enhance their profits.
In addition to the utilization of symbols, the filmmaker also employs cinematic techniques to create meaning. Outfits, when employed in movies, are essential means of establishing meanings and themes. In The Irishman, varied outfits are utilized for different scenarios to establish diverse meanings. In the initial segment of the movie, Sheeran is attired in a leather jacket, jeans, and a loose hat. He appears informal, less refined, and more of a low-status individual. It also seems that he dons the same type of clothing during different appearances- first at the gas station and later at the Friends Lounge. The director employs this approach to depict Sheeran as an elderly and impoverished individual striving to meet his daily needs. It also implies that he is willing to undertake additional tasks as long as it boosts his earnings. He is clad in white aprons solely when transporting meat steaks from his van to the customer’s premises.
Conversely, the members of the Mafia are well-dressed, neat, and well-groomed. Their leaders like Dutillio, Bufallio, Jimmy Hoffa, and Angelo Bruno are all in black, blue, or dark suits, with colorful ties. In most instances, they are attired in these outfits even when participating in gatherings in bars and lounges. This indicates that they are part of an organized group that adheres to codes of conduct or specific behaviors that each must adhere to and which delineate the culture of the setting.
It is also crucial to comprehend how the filmmakers employed the outfits approach
