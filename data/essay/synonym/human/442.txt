A new innovation that has recently emerged in the marketplace is the electric kick scooter. It rapidly became popular as it permitted individuals to dash from one area of the city to another. Simultaneously, individuals spent less time as they were not trapped at traffic signals (Hagiu and Wright 1527). Its competitive edge, however, lies in the fact that it does not damage the natural environment and demands less energy for upkeep. In essence, such scooters consume minimal energy resources to operate and hence are superior to a car (Hagiu and Wright 1527). It is important to mention that some electric scooters can be powered by the sun correspondingly; it can be characterized as a straightforward apparatus for a modest price, which facilitates swift movement. Therefore, the aforementioned benefits contribute to the growing preference for electric kick scooters among people; as a result, they have swiftly gained traction in the market.

A commodity that will gradually broaden its presence in the marketplace is cordless earphones. It is gaining popularity because every cellphone producer is striving to manufacture such an add-on. Concurrently, the competitive advantage is that they are compact and convenient to use (Hagiu and Wright 1527). Despite their cost being higher than regular earphones, they have a longer lifespan and are less prone to damage. They have solidified their market position due to the fact that they directly connect to phones wirelessly, which is convenient in the contemporary world. Furthermore, individuals who purchase the phone also opt for earphones from the same brand (Hagiu and Wright 1527). Hence, the advantages outlined above contribute to the variety of wireless earphones available on the market and their popularity.
