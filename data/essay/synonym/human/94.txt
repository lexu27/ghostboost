The obstacles that companies may encounter on their path to internal logistical integration can be categorized into five groups based on their origin and nature. The initial obstacles arise from an inadequately cohesive structure of a company that leads to ineffective communication among its divisions. As per Bowersox (2019), this stems from the "conventional practice" of consolidating the workers responsible for specific tasks into clusters to facilitate outstanding performance through functional excellence (p. 332). However, in reality, this method can lead to an ineffective corporate culture, manifesting as a lack of cohesion, spirit, and commitment, often starting from senior management as well (Naseem et al., 2021). My work experience exemplifies this; I have been employed by a company where the manager displayed little to no interest in organizational procedures. Additionally, some colleagues from various departments believed their roles were the most crucial, causing conflicts.

The conventional systems of administration and recognition, which stem from the aforementioned functional arrangement, can also impede internal integration. Notably, they "reflect" that arrangement, emphasizing employees' accomplishments in their field of work rather than their participation in the corporate culture and contribution to the overall company performance (Bowersox, 2019, p. 332). Indeed, this commences even before employment; numerous educational institutions adhere to the traditional evaluation system that solely relies on grades. Consequently, graduates, including myself, need to deliberately learn about alternative recognition systems, which often remains theoretical.

Given the above, information dissemination within companies with conventional structures typically lacks coherence. Specifically, the data these companies handle should be structured based on function and responsibility, automatically restricting their applicability and range (Bowersox, 2019). This can lead not only to poor departmental integration but also to ineffective communication with clients and subpar service quality; hence, Naseem et al. (2021) opt to term this group coordination hurdles. In reality, the company mentioned earlier in the first section can serve as an illustration in this context. The absence of unity, notably, resulted in a lack of awareness and dedication, leading to only a few employees delivering superior services.

It is important to note that such hindered data circulation hampers knowledge exchange, consequently complicating the integration of new units within the company. As a result, these companies struggle with limited expansion capabilities and partnerships; these necessitate cross-functionality, which is hindered by the traditional structure. Additionally, even the necessity to recruit new staff may pose a risk to productivity as it may be challenging to make up for their lack of relevant expertise (Bowersox, 2019). This was actually one of the reasons for my departure from the aforementioned company. Specifically, I saw no opportunities for growth there, as the informational constraints hindered my personal fulfillment.

Lastly, another potential obstacle is inadequate infrastructure, encompassing primarily transportation, storage, and inventory. Hence, the latter, as emphasized by Bowersox (2019), should be kept to a minimum necessary to withstand fluctuations in demand or similar disruptions. Otherwise, a company might encounter significant financial difficulties arising from the need to maintain and store excess equipment; its obsolescence could exacerbate the situation. In reality, this is a common occurrence even in daily life; for instance, many people have closets full of unnecessary items, and I am no exception. However, such a practice is particularly detrimental in business as it can hinder process harmonization.
