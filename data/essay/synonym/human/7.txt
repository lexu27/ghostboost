Carl Jung recognizes the maternal complex with an inborn sense of concern at the core of the emotional bond between a mother and a child. Nevertheless, in the deficiency of such a bond, an original pattern emerges where a mother's failure to meet the crucial requirements linked with the relationship. The consequence drives the sufferer, the child, to search for solace elsewhere (Bobroff 35). At the heart of the maternal complex lies the maternal archetype, indicating that in each emotional bond, between the child and the mother, on one side, an archetype supporting and safety image reveals. On the flip side, an archetype embodying possessiveness, privation, and obscurity emerges (Bobroff 36). In the movie Every Secret Thing, a intricate emotional bond between Alice and her mother is present and establishes the fundamental connection between the two and the connection with the abductions occurring.

The intricate connection between Alice and her mother positions Alice at the focal point of the abduction. Hellen is repulsed by Alice to the degree of deeming Ronnie her favored child, a stance that leaves Alice profoundly uncertain. Additionally, the strain in interracial relationships is linked with the subsequent abduction and delivering a biracial child while incarcerated, and relinquishing it for adoption, Alice becomes the primary suspect in the scenario (Berg). Alice’s mother, the planner behind the abduction, in the initial and subsequent instances, and homicide, in the initial instance, plants proof to ensure Alice emerges as the principal suspect. Hellen, via treachery and deceit, deliberately Alice winds up in prison (Berg). Furthermore, in contrast to the apathy in Ronnie’s guardians, there is no emotional bond between the parents and their daughters. As the movie concludes, the viewers discover that not only were Alice and Ronnie wrongly incarcerated, the judicial system failed to demonstrate that Helen is the murderer.
