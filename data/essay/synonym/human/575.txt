Initially, I contend that social uprisings do not merely employ disruptive actions occasionally but are inherently disruptive. Social uprisings typically arise when the current establishments — ballots, political factions, and governmental bureaus — are incapable or disinclined to resolve apparent problems. Consequently, social uprisings function as a tool of direct democracy that expresses specific stances and communicates them to authorities. By executing this, social uprisings disturb an ideal concept of liberal democracy, where inhabitants elect the representatives, who, in return, speak for them in governing entities. Therefore, the disruptive characteristic of social uprisings permits oppressed and underrepresented societal factions to voice their opinions and be acknowledged. Furthermore, this idea is applicable to all parts of the political spectrum, rendering social uprisings beneficial to the democratic political structure. For instance, the anti-globalization movement encompasses a range of concerns — while its leftist element is focused on ecology and workers' rights, right-wing anti-globalism strives to uphold national autonomy and control immigration (Greenberg et al., 2018). In this aspect, social uprisings encompass diverse identities and encourage political diversity.

Secondly, it is crucial to differentiate the disruptive characteristic of social uprisings from particular disruptive strategies that they deploy to advocate their program. For instance, both supporters of the Civil Rights Movement and Black Lives Matter (BLM) employed disruptive techniques in the battle against racism. The distinction between them is in the communication — while the Civil Rights Movement actively aimed to draw individuals from external sources, BLM grappled with the concept of inclusivity (Clayton, 2018). Ultimately, Dr. Martin Luther King's rallying cry "We Shall Overcome" drew numerous non-Black supporters, hence BLM would arguably gain from a more comprehensive approach.
