Research suggests that streaming platforms are the future of content dissemination. This structure succeeds in capturing the core of the 21st-century ethos and fuses advanced solutions with traditional leisure methods (Fagerjord & Kueng, 2019). Nowadays, there are numerous platforms providing such content, and it might be challenging to determine the most suitable one. As the examination shows, Disney+ is the optimal choice in this context with the potential surpassing that of Netflix. This service blends classics and innovation to deliver an unparalleled standard of amusement (Agnihotri & Bhattacharya, 2022). It takes cues from well-established franchises like Marvel, Pixar, and Star Wars, introducing a fresh perspective to these familiar worlds (Disney, 2022). In essence, Disney+ presents renowned works from its own creation, alongside fresh original material that caters to the preferences of most audiences, serving it in the most user-friendly format available today.
