This framework enables assessing the company’s advantages, shortcomings, chances, and risks, which in turn establishes the basis for setting appropriate strategic objectives and formulating a cohesive business strategy. Diversicare Healthcare Services, Inc. is a healthcare provider concentrating on the realm of post-acute care (Diversicare, 2020). The organization consistently offers high-quality medical services and treatments to its patients.
Thesis Declaration
This document aims to conduct a SWOT evaluation of Diversicare Healthcare, covering its advantages, shortcomings, chances, and risks, to create suitable strategic objectives for the company.
Advantages
  * A wide array of high-quality acute care services. As mentioned in the most recent annual report of Diversicare (2020), the organization has a solid reputation as a supplier of high-quality, cost-efficient services due to its pursuit of excellence. The organization implements an evidence-based approach and a quality assurance system to provide patients with effective and safe treatment and therapy alternatives.
  * A total of 61 operational locations across eight states. As Diversicare (2020) discloses, the “continuing operations consist of 61 nursing centers with 7,250 licensed skilled nursing beds … in Alabama, Indiana, Kansas, Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio, Tennessee, and Texas” (p. 2). Consequently, the organization caters to the requirements of an extended population base.
  * Robust corporate culture. Diversicare highlights the significance of connectedness, compassion, trust, respect, and communication as fundamental values shaping the workplace atmosphere and interaction with patients (“A name you can trust,” n. d.). Thus, Diversicare’s corporate culture is considered its distinguishing characteristic compared to other post-acute care suppliers in the United States.
  * The faithfulness of clients and workers. Diversicare is acknowledged for exceptional experience by its clients and for its distinct culture by its workers through respective 2020 accolades (“A name you can trust,” n. d.). The medical personnel is equipped with training and tools for acquiring and enhancing necessary skills. Customer contentment is assured through efficient communication, assistance, and continuous enhancement.
Weaknesses
  * Reduced income and high operational expenditures due to the COVID-19 pandemic. According to Stulick (2021), Diversicare disclosed: “a net loss from continuing operations at -$2.9 million, or -43 cents per share in the third quarter” of 2020 (para. 1).
  * Personnel turnover rate due to overwork. One of the primary obstacles the organization confronts is the issue of retaining qualified medical staff in the context of high demand and longer or irregular hours (Diversicare, 2020). The pandemic and competition exacerbate increased workload and the related personnel shortage.
  * Insufficient communication between workers and management. Diversicare encounters a challenge in ensuring effective internal communication among its staff, which leads to feeble leadership (Diversicare, 2020).
  * A restricted supply of licensed skilled nursing center beds. As Diversicare (2020) points out in the annual report, “high construction costs … and start-up expenses also act to restrict growth in the supply for such centers” (p. 6).
Chances
  * Expanding the number of nursing centers. Diversicare (2020) can “acquire and lease new centers, focusing primarily on opportunities that can leverage” the existing infrastructure (p. 2). By aligning the growth with strategic objectives, the company can identify markets for continuing operations.
  * The utilization of innovation and technology. The organization fosters an evidence-based approach to offer purposeful services for its patients (“A name you can trust,” n. d.). Therefore, Diversicare can cultivate an innovation culture to enhance the quality of care and promote efficient solutions. The utilization of technology is another opportunity to augment communication, eradicate medical errors, and enhance management.
  * Enhancing profitability at existing centers. Diversicare can address the financial challenges by enhancing the payor mix and promoting higher occupancy (Diversicare, 2020). Moreover, the company can persist in introducing marketing initiatives at the existing nursing centers.
  * Offering additional specialty services. According to Diversicare (2020), based on the particular market needs, they “may include complex medical and rehabilitation services, as well as memory care units and another specialty programming” (p. 2).
Threats
  * Safety threats linked with the coronavirus pandemic. Analogous to other healthcare providers in the industry, the organization acknowledges the necessity to implement additional safety and care measures for patients during social isolation and prepare nursing centers for outbreaks (Diversicare, 2020).
  * Financial expenditures due to COVID-19. As Stulick (2021) articulates, Diversicare “incurred $7.2 million in additional healthcare-related expenses including labor costs, personal protective equipment (PPE), testing and infection control supplies” (para. 10).
  * Government restrictions are impacting operations. Reduced occupancy is viewed as one of the outcomes of local government’s constraints and alterations in healthcare protocols (Diversicare, 2020). Furthermore, there is a necessity for centers to abide by licensure and certification requirements.
  * The fiercely competitive nature of the post-acute care industry. Diversicare (2020) reports that some of its “present and potential competitors for acquisitions are significantly larger and have or may obtain greater financial and marketing resources” (p. 6). Moreover, competition contributes to salary hikes, which entails additional expenditures for the company to recruit and retain capable staff.
Strategic Objectives Development
  * Employ innovation of technology to enhance communication and leadership and boost the quality of care.
  * Augment revenue by expanding the number of nursing centers, enhancing the payor mix, and promoting higher occupancy.
