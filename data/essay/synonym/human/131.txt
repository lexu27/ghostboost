One of the unique features of the nursing profession is the experts’ necessity to continually adjust to the dynamic setting of healthcare provision and methods for patient care. To support this procedure, scholars have recognized a range of transformation theories that aim to organize the process of incorporating new methodologies (Udod & Wagner, 2018). The two most prevalent theories of transformation in the nursing field are Lewin’s transformation theory and Roger’s five-step theory. In Lewin’s structure, the transformation procedure progresses through three key phases: unfreezing, transformation proper, and refreezing (Udod & Wagner, 2018). Therefore, as per this structure, to initiate transformation, the team must recognize the current workflow and "unfreeze" this system, actively engage in implementing transformation and new operational models, and, ultimately, establish the transformation as a new widely accepted norm.
In contrast to Lewin’s method, Roger’s model is more focused on the employees’ reaction and approval of the transformation via the gradual change process. Indeed, this five-step model suggests thorough initial research, collecting employees’ input, carrying out a trial study, and actually executing the transformation proposal (Udod & Wagner, 2018). Therefore, it can be deduced that while Lewin’s model mainly deals with the execution of the evidence-backed adjustments, the five-step model is intended to demonstrate the proposed transformation's benefits in the clinical setting.
When discussing the transformation proposal for the capstone initiative, Roger’s method of executing transformation is more fitting. Considering that the project aims to validate the theory of the EBP training’s favorable influence on nurses’ self-assurance and patient contentment, the information gathered from the intervention will be pivotal for further integrating this transformation into nursing practice. This theory has also been endorsed by the mentor, as she has effectively integrated adjustments into the personnel’s scheduling routines utilizing Roger’s model.
