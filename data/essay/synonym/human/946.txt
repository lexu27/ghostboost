Introduction
The writer discusses the development of filmmaking from the early years to the 21st century. The debate focuses on how information technology has revolutionized the way audiences experience narratives and visuals while viewing various films. Progress in technology empowers the audience to manage both the visuals and plotlines with unexpected delights that immerse them in the movie, allowing them to perceive the scenes as if they were their own (Sobchack). The writer hypothesizes that through the incorporation of technology into filmmaking, viewers have novel methods of encountering the visuals of the cinema. Furthermore, the concealed tranquility of the movies becomes visible and attainable. The computer system has facilitated the comprehension of individual frames and the film’s concealed information effortlessly, precisely, and efficiently.

The perspective
This publication is a historical investigation of the role modern media technology is offering to traditional cinemas by reassessing the history of films and their utility. New technologies grant the audience the capacity to steer both the visuals and storyline (Sobchack). Viewers can replay scenes, conduct slow motions on film segments, and even freeze-frame the film (Mulvey, 147). This exploration prompts spectators to have an intense and illogical dedication or commitment to continuous viewing. Moreover, viewers' capability to manipulate the film visuals bestows aesthetic characteristics upon cinema materials.

Assessing the breadth of the argument
Despite focusing on the film sector, the writer’s depiction of the psychological and societal dimensions of cinema encompasses the events and innovations prevalent from the twentieth to the twenty-first century. During this era, numerous methods or systems transitioned into innovative approaches due to computer technology (Grant). Various fields, disciplines, social interactions, and human relations began embracing information technology. The film industry also embraced new technology. The book delves into the realms of traditional visual gratification and narrative film facilitated by the digital spectrum, which unveils alternative perspectives of cinema viewing. The narrative delves into the cinema's history, signifying the transition from traditional films to digital age productions.

Several case studies have reinforced the notion that technology has transformed the film sector. For instance, around fifty years ago, filmmakers needed a complete crew to record movies; for aerial shots, they relied on aircraft equipped with heavy cameras. Post-filming, manual editing involved cutting and assembling the film ("The Impact of Technology in the Film Industry"). This procedure was tedious, and the output quality was subpar. In the late 20th century, technology intervened with the introduction of lightweight cameras that capture sharp and high-quality visuals. Cloud synchronization has streamlined film editing to the extent that filmmakers can collaborate from anywhere globally. Viewers are no longer restricted to theater viewing, as on-demand services, streaming platforms, computers, tablets, and smartphones enable them to watch films at their convenience.

Technology plays a vital role in filmmaking by employing computer-generated graphics to create special effects in the cinema sector. This technique proves more cost-effective than traditional methods since it utilizes software to generate visuals instead of physical setups. For instance, in 1973, the film 'Westworld' utilized computer-generated imagery (Sharma). This fictional production featured both robotic and human characters; other instances include iconic films like 'Star Wars' and 'Star Trek II,' which featured laser weaponry and robotic movements. Additionally, animation and three-dimensional (3D) effects are employed.

The connections the author establishes between ideas and evidence presented
In this publication, the author draws connections between past and present concepts to showcase temporal shifts. The introduction elucidates technological advancements from the 1970s to the early 2000s; in the 1970s, films were primarily viewed in designated rooms and projected onto screens. Presently, technological changes have shifted from darkened spaces to self-directed viewing via DVDs or videos. Formerly, films were characterized by delays, which technology has replaced with features like slow motion, editing, and freeze-frame, enhancing the viewer experience (Mulvey, 144). In chapter 1, "Passing Time," the relationship between early cinema and contemporary technological films is expounded. Technology enables 21st-century viewers to simulate an indexical image to evoke a similar sense of wonder experienced by past cinema audiences before technological integration.

Strengths of the argument
By juxtaposing stillness and technology concerning cinema evolution, modern film concepts have revamped the cinematic experience by introducing delays that aid spectators in analyzing the film. Digital mechanisms manipulate films by introducing delays, fragmenting scenes, and enabling rewinds (Thompson). This signals a paradigm shift in the film industry, offering new means to pause, introduce delays, and repetitions that were previously unattainable with projectors. Moreover, the pause feature allows viewers to discern the indexicality and historical essence of the visuals (Thompson). This mechanism proves crucial for political analysis and bridging contemporary societal gaps.

Weaknesses of the argument
The juxtaposition of stillness and moving images places film actors in a scenario of unnatural fusion between human bodies and machines. The ability to control the film's flow through constant stops, delays, and replays might lead to audiences becoming overly possessive. Technology empowers viewers to dominate film characters (Thompson), fostering an excessive attachment to visuals that previously required external aids like production stills or calendar images. Another drawback of the technological argument is exemplified in television programs, which enhance film stillness by dividing films into episodes viewed over extended periods.

Conclusions
This publication delves into the historical role of new media technology in revitalizing traditional cinemas by reevaluating the history and significance of films. The author's exploration of cinema's psychological and societal dimensions spans events and breakthroughs from the twentieth to the twenty-first century. The narrative embraces classic visual satisfaction and narrative filmmaking facilitated by the digital realm, presenting alternative cinema viewing angles. It navigates through cinema history, marking the transition from conventional to digital age productions. The introduction charts technological progress from the 1970s to the early 2000s, illustrating the shift from room screenings to self-directed DVD or video viewing.

Technology enables 21st-century viewers to replicate indexical images, allowing them to share the wonder experienced by past cinema audiences. Pausing films provides viewers with a vantage point to discern visual indexicality and historical context. However, the power to control the film's flow through stops, delays, and replays may lead to possessive audience behavior. Additionally, technology empowers viewers to dominate film characters. Ultimately, technology fosters an excessive attachment to visuals previously facilitated by external aids like production stills or calendar images.
