In relation to his military intellect, warfare leadership, and conquest campaign, few kings in history can be equated to Alexander the Great. By introducing a new Hellenistic era of Greek culture and impact, the Monarch of Macedon established an empire that extended from Greece and Egypt to the Indian subcontinent, forever altering the ancient world. And all of this by the time he passed away at the age of 32, prompting the inquiry of what Alexander could have achieved if he had lived longer.
If Alexander had proceeded eastward, he would have encountered the Chinese during their 'Warring States Period' and thereby met the powerful Qin State, which would unite all of China a century later. However, considering the diminished spirits of his troops, he was improbable to have reached China initially. The soldiers declined to advance any further following years of combat in distant foreign territories.
While assimilating foreigners into Alexander's administrative and military systems would have facilitated the day-to-day management of his empire, it also resulted in heightened animosity and distrust among Macedonians. To enforce his decisions, Alexander favored severe penalties, which, in conjunction with his extended absences, could not have bolstered the ruler's popularity. Nevertheless, Alexander's handling of his childhood companion Harpalus, whom he assigned various governmental roles throughout his reign, suggests that he was not unwilling to let personal connections cloud his judgment. This reality, though, is scarcely surprising given Alexander's swiftly declining mental condition, as he grappled with paranoia and seclusion in the concluding years of his reign.
