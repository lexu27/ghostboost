The activity in the series occurred in the Bronx in 1977. Initially, it might appear simply a tale about a adolescent, Zeke, who attempts to impress the girl he adores, Mylene, who does not reciprocate his feelings since she is fixated on singing. Nonetheless, even the inaugural episode might prompt the audience to ponder over the issues in American society in the midst of the 20th century. It portrays the challenges that the inhabitants of impoverished neighborhoods encountered, such as the scarcity of funds and employment opportunities and the elevated degree of criminal activity. Apart from that, the initial series demonstrates the disparity in perspectives youths and their guardians possess. It is depicted in the clash between Mylene, enthusiastic about becoming a renowned pop vocalist, and her father, who only approves of spiritual songs (Luhrmann, 2016). The dispute intensifies as Mylene visits the club to present the record to the producer, disregarding her fatherâ€™s prohibition.
Ultimately, the episode heading, Where there is wreckage, there is expectation for a prize, prompts the audience to contemplate the type of treasure that may be safeguarded in wreckage. The primary figures of the series, Zeke, Mylene, Shaolin, and others, are exceedingly gifted. Zeke composes poignant verses, Mylene possesses a melodious voice, and Shaolin embodies the spirit of a commander and can unite individuals. Nevertheless, it will be challenging for them to carve out a path in the music domain because they hail from an impoverished neighborhood and lack connections in the industry.
