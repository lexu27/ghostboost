For the political and lawful system to function properly, all their components should align. Although U.S. states have significant autonomy and possess their own charters, they should not conflict with the federal U.S. Constitution, including the initial ten amendments to it – the Bill of Rights. The former delineates responsibilities and rights of different branches of authority and the latter contains a list of fundamental human rights. If the state charter contradicts the federal one, it might indicate a lack of unity and democracy within the nation. The paper aims to scrutinize Article I of the Florida Constitution regarding its correspondence to the U.S. Constitution and, specifically, the Bill of Rights.
Each clause of the Constitution of the State of Florida addresses various legal aspects. Article I encompasses the proclamation of rights guaranteed to all the state’s inhabitants and is presented in 27 sections (The Florida Senate). The current examination will concentrate on three of them: religious liberty, rights of accused and of victims, right of seclusion. Each of them is presented in distinct sections of Article I.
Religious liberty is one of the fundamental rights that ensures democracy. It is enshrined in Article I’s Section 3 of the Florida Constitution, which states that no statute will compel individuals to follow any religion or forbid or penalize its free exercise (The Florida Senate). It corresponds to Amendment I of the Bill of Rights (U.S. Senate). Furthermore, the Florida Constitution emphasizes that “religious freedom shall not justify practices inconsistent with public morals, peace, or safety” (The Florida Senate). Thus, concerning religious liberty, the Florida Constitution aligns with the Bill of Rights and has a significant additional note.
The rights of the accused and of crime victims illustrate the rights of those engaged in criminal prosecutions. They are itemized in Article I’s Section 16 (The Florida Senate). Initially, the section asserts that the accused must “be informed of the nature of the accusation,” have the entitlement to present witnesses, challenge adverse witnesses, and have a prompt, public, and impartial trial (The Florida Senate). It corresponds to Amendment VI to the U.S. Constitution, where the same rights are itemized (U.S. Senate). Section 16 has been recently revised to underscore and ensure the victim’s rights (Cassell & Garvin, 2020). Now, it ensures the safeguarding of crime victims’ rights and interests, which incorporates safety, privacy, respect for their dignity, protection from the accused, and all forms of abuse (The Florida Senate). Astonishingly, the U.S. Constitution does not explicitly address this aspect.
Another crucial right, essential for upholding democracy, is the right of privacy. It is enshrined in Section 23 of the Florida Constitution (The Florida Senate). It guarantees that all citizens have “the right to be let alone and free from governmental intrusion into the person’s private life except as otherwise provided herein” (The Florida Senate). This right was added to the Florida Constitution through the Privacy Amendment ratified in 1980 (Skinner, 2020). This right was utilized to advocate for the Death with Dignity Act in favor of physician-assisted suicide (Skinner, 2020). U.S. Constitution lacks the corresponding section, and other states may have different laws in this respect.
In conclusion, the Constitution of the State of Florida generally aligns with the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights, demonstrating that the state shares the same fundamental democratic values as all Americans. They encompass religious freedom and the rights of the accused during a criminal prosecution. Nevertheless, akin to other state constitutions, it presents an expanded set of rights and guidelines specifically for its inhabitants. For instance, it provides an extensive list of crime victims’ rights and explicitly formulated right of privacy, absent in the U.S. Constitution.
