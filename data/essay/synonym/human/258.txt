It is a movie about the delicacy of manhood, men’s psychological well-being, and how they are linked. Fight Club is a raw depiction of what occurs when men’s uncertainties transform into manliness in overdrive. Therefore, this movie embodies harmful manliness. Fight Club demonstrates men discontented with the condition of manhood. The figures are distinct in that many of them were nurtured by their mothers because their fathers either departed from the family or got separated. As per Ta, the outcome is that the figures perceive themselves as “a generation of men nurtured by women” (270). In their existence, there is insufficient masculine guidance for the establishment of their manhood. It validates the notion of phallocentrism, which is founded on the concept of emasculated women. Women nurture offspring so that they can assimilate into the symbolic structure.
Fight Club is a malevolent parody about discovering, fostering, and annihilating oneself. It questions notions of manliness, appending to the portrayal of a genuine man various traits that can be named associative and establishing self-destruction and a ruinous effect on society as one of life’s objectives. The triumph of Jack’s subpersonality over Tyler on the top of a skyscraper indicates that the virtue in a genuine man can subdue the destructive aspect. The capability to selflessly give up and be accountable for his deeds in Jack, who has undergone the progression of manhood, motivates some hopefulness, but the conclusion remains undecided.
