A cardiovascular event occurs when the heart suddenly stops pumping blood, leading the individual to lose consciousness and display no indications of blood circulation and respiration. Immediate demise can happen if corrective measures are not executed promptly enough. One of Australia's primary reasons for mortality and morbidity is heart failure (Paratz et al., 2021). Annually, approximately 5,000 Australians under 50 years old endure suspected heart failure. Ninety percent of the casualties pass away directly due to the failure (Paratz et al., 2021). Heart failure can arise in anyone, irrespective of age or medical history, but it is more probable in individuals already diagnosed with heart conditions (Kandasamy et al., 2019). Hence, early defibrillation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) safeguard an individual's life and diminish any long-term neurological dysfunction.
The survival prospects of a patient necessitating resuscitation hinge on the accurate execution of the CPR process and the immediate cooperative reaction of the medical teams. The footage acquired from YouTube endeavors to demonstrate the fundamental stages for appropriate CPR and the application of a defibrillator (ChristianCare, 2011). As per the footage, a nurse enters the area and observes no patient movement on the bed subsequent to addressing the patient and receiving no reply. The nurse takes action by calling out to her colleagues for aid. If a patient does not respond to physical or verbal stimuli, it is best advised that the nurse or any healthcare provider seek assistance (Olasveengen et al., 2020). The Australian Resuscitation Council (ARC) guideline three proposes that healthcare providers seek support from colleagues in the event of a heart failure (Curtis et al., 2019). Since heart failure can induce neurological dysfunction within a few minutes of its inception, cooperative effort among the medical staff is crucial.
Before making any medical decisions or commencing CPR, it is vital to evaluate the patient's airway and determine whether CPR should be initiated. A comprehensive yet swift evaluation of the airway is crucial for managing patients necessitating immediate CPR. As per ARC guideline four, clearing the airway encompasses opening the mouth and gently lowering the head to enable any noticeable foreign matter, such as food, blood, vomit, or fluids, to drain (Bray et al., 2021). Fingertips can be utilized to eliminate visible foreign matter by sweeping. The finger sweep is beneficial in instances of unconscious adults and children older than one-year-old who have a foreign body airway obstruction (FBAO) (Couper et al., 2020). Nevertheless, the individual clearing the mouth from foreign matter should be cautious to avoid being bitten and to prevent harm to the patient.
Furthermore, if the airway is obstructed during resuscitation, the patient should promptly be turned onto their side to clear it. Following airway clearance, it is imperative to reassess responsiveness and regular respiration. In the footage, the nurse solely ascertains if the breath sounds are audible but overlooks confirming any blockage in the mouth (ChristianCare, 2011). The guideline also suggests that the airway be opened utilizing the head tilt-chin lift technique (Bray et al., 2021). Moreover, the team initiated CPR without verifying the presence or absence of a pulse. The carotid pulse should be monitored initially and during resuscitation to determine whether CPR should be administered.
Another crucial element of CPR is the insertion of a large-bore intravenous cannula. In urgent situations such as heart failure, healthcare professionals must act swiftly in acquiring intravenous access as it facilitates adequate fluid infusion at a quicker rate. Additionally, it ensures that emergency medications, such as epinephrine, are promptly administered to achieve peak blood concentration (Feinstein et al., 2017). Epinephrine is an emergency medication administered intravenously in the footage. The provision of intravenous medications in the footage aligns with ARC guideline (9.2), which necessitates fluid and medication administration via intravenous access, imperative in reviving the patient (Sethi & Chalwin, 2018). Fluid infusion is crucial for patients who have experienced a heart attack to facilitate tissue perfusion.
The ability to respire normally is crucial to sustain life. Resuscitation is necessitated for a patient who gasps or breathes irregularly and is unresponsive. As per ARC guideline five, the medical team visually inspects, listens, and senses while evaluating the patient's breathing pattern (McLure et al., 2021). They should observe movements in the abdominal region or lower chest. They should also listen for air emanating from the mouth or nose and feel for movements in the nose and mouth (McLure et al., 2021). In the video, the nurse actively listens for the presence or absence of air moving through the nose and mouth in accordance with the ARC recommendations.
During resuscitation, breaths can be administered to the patient through various methods contingent on the setting or abilities of the caregiver. These methods encompass mouth-to-mouth rescue breaths, mouth-to-nose, mouth-to-stoma, mouth-to-mask, and bag valve masks (BVM) (Panchal et al., 2020). In the footage, breaths are supplied via a bag valve mask. Ventilation with a bag valve mask is another approach to providing rescue breathing. An inflating bag is connected to a non-rebreather valve and a face mask to form a bag valve mask apparatus. A clear airway (Guideline 4), an appropriate mask seal, and an acceptable breathing method are requisite for effective bag valve mask ventilation (Olasveengen et al., 2021). Continuous ventilation with the bag valve or improper technique may result in air entering the stomach, heightening the likelihood of gastric contents reflux (Newell et al., 2018). When BVM ventilation is utilized, it is recommended that two experienced rescuers administer ventilation for the unconscious individual: one to manage the airway, seal, and mask, while the other operates the bag valve mask.
The footage illustrates the utilization of a BVM in providing rescue breaths where the nurse employs the jaw thrust maneuver using one hand while the other hand delivers oxygen via the bag. However, the bag valve mask should have been linked to a reservoir or oxygen mask, augmenting a high oxygen concentration in the body. The use of BVM has the potential to save lives and is notably less invasive than intubation.
Compression of the chest is one of the most vital procedures in resuscitation that must be executed correctly. The video depicts the compressions being dispensed at a pace of 30 compressions followed by two rescue breaths after every two minutes. This adheres to the ACR guideline six, which prescribes a rhythm of 30 chest compressions before administering two rescue breaths. According to some studies, compression rates below 30 are correlated with a diminished likelihood of survival (Maconochie et al., 2020). Each compression should prompt a downward displacement of the lower sternum, approximately constituting a third of the chest's total depth. In adults, this equates to an elevation of over 5cm in height (Garcia-Jorda et al., 2019). There is little uncertainty that inadequate compression depth is linked to
