Globalisation has indeed become a noteworthy trend in the development of geopolitical and cultural practices of recent decades. With the emergence of the Internet, people have become interconnected, even across continents: such a potent catalyst could not fail to have an essential consequence. Especially, individuals from different countries and cultures have become more assimilated into a common, emerging culture in which there is space for the customs of all peoples. Meanwhile, the representation of diverse cultures in this collective one is uneven, indicating that stronger national cultures can assimilate weaker ones. 
A natural response to the unification of individuals was the rise of nationalistic feelings among peoples whose cultures tend to be less dominant. Thus, the dissemination of American sentiment (and notably the American dream) worldwide frequently leads to individuals from other regions growing apathetic towards their culture. Additionally, globalisation can result in the erosion of the autonomy of vulnerable communities: for instance, if the major powers (the United States, China, Russia, Britain) stifle the progress of small neighboring ones (Hawaii, Hong Kong, Abkhazia, or former British colonies). Healthy patriotism is not an issue because communities seek to shield themselves and maintain their cultural and political sovereignty. Nevertheless, extreme, aggressive actions by nationalists generate international conflicts and impede globalisation. 
Therefore, globalisation should not be judged based on whether it is positive or negative. Alternatively, it should be viewed as a natural milestone in the progression of humanity. Globalisation does possess advantages and disadvantages, but it is an undeniable reality. The world now discovers itself exceedingly interconnected, as each individual can receive information from another continent, listen to foreign music, and peruse non-native literature within minutes. This leads to a fresh, collective culture. In this condition, radical nationalism poses a significant challenge that society and governments must address.
