Preface
Relative politics is a scientific notion that is widely employed in the examination of political science. This concept and ideology are utilized to scrutinize different political entities of nations, highlighting how distinctively they manage their political matters while simultaneously recognizing distinctions. As per Caramani (2020), relative politics hinge on relative techniques that compare one country’s political structure to another to comprehend the shortcomings or achievements of diverse countries’ political structures. There are numerous mythological methodologies for studying political science, encompassing statistical, case study, and experimental techniques (Chilcote 2018). In simpler words, relative politics employs relative approaches in scrutinizing two or more nations to evaluate various political functions. The two nations selected for this academic paper are Canada and the United States. Hence, the concept of relative politics will be employed to the two chosen countries’ political entity systems to identify both resemblances and disparities.
Canadian and American Government
Nations and states possess specific regulations and statutes that comprise different contents. This indicates that the regulations apply diversely in states or countries. Thus, Canada and Unites States are distinct nations; the two possess political systems and entities that contrast in operation and how the essential process unfolds. As indicated by John Wesley Dafoe (2022), the political systems of the United States and Canada demonstrate some similarities and differences. Despite the numerous alterations that have transpired in both countries’ systems, they still mirror one another with minor variances. John Wesley Dafoe (2022) educates that the Canadian Dominion and the American Commonwealth elucidate the two nations’ political system evolution. However, John Wesley Dafoe (2022) observed that Canada has remained under the shelter of Great Britain and thus adheres to parent-state laws.
Conversely, the United States is an autonomous state and derives its principles from the European constitution (Floridi 2020, p. 371). Therefore, from the countries’ profiles, it is evident that the two possess distinct government operations with some resemblances.
Canada and the American government exhibit resemblances and disparities worth deliberating in this paper. Floridi (2020, p. 372) reports that the two nations’ governments possess central authority with numerous supporting local administrations literally, recognized as states in the United States and provinces in Canada. In both nations, the central government or authority possesses immense power and is authorized to national matters, encompassing the security and integrity of the local administration (Palsson et al. 2020, p. 1269). Other studies, however, report that Canada is not yet an autonomous state and hence relies on the imperial power of England (Gilmore, Kousky and St.Clair 2022, p. 216).
This implies that the regulations governing Canada are derived from England’s laws. From this assertion, Canada, therefore, lacks authority or voice to declare war or manage its matters independently without involving the great power of England (Gilmore, Kousky and St.Clair 2022, p. 218). Therefore, it can be recognized that the great power of England is the foundational rock of the Canadian constitution.
The two nations’ governments also notably differ when the authority assumed by the respective central governments is juxtaposed. According to Dauvergne (2018, p. 579), the Dominion government’s powers encompass all that federal laws confer. Conversely, the converse is true since the central government appears to possess equivalent powers with the federal government. Regarding the judicial systems of the two nations, it is crucial to mention that there are also some resemblances and differences in how court proceedings are conducted in each nation. The judicial systems are akin in that the Canadian system comprises several federal courts at the province level, equivalent to the United States federal courts in different states (Dauvergne 2018, p. 581). Nonetheless, Canada is purported to possess one federal court compared to the United Supreme Court since these two courts assume immense power. One notable difference in the judicial system of the two nations is that there is no federal court in each province as there are courts in each state.
Political Parties
Democracy in any nation thrives when citizens can articulate their voices and interests by electing the leaders they prefer. A group of federal representatives defines the United States democratic system voted for by the United States citizens. The contemporary politics observed in the United States is an outcome of two major parties, the Democrats and the Republicans, which have been the dominating parties since the inception of Unites States politics (Dippel 2022, p. 33).
Ethnicity, race, originality, religion, and money are the major factors that influence United States political party system. In their study, Hess and Renner (2019, p. 420) discovered that the United States Federal government comprises three legislative, executive, and judicial branches. Regarding democracy, the United States practices representative democracy, where leaders are elected to represent other citizens in the national senate, congress, and local governments (Hess & Renner 2019, p. 423). Although there are some minority parties in the United States political system, the state could be denoted as a two-party political system since the country only harbors two predominant parties with high chances of winning an election.
Canada displays a distinct political system from that of the United States. As per Tanguay (2021, p. 741), the Canadian political system is grounded on the context of parliamentary egalitarianism. Canada is a constitutional nation, unlike the United States, and thus relishes a multiparty system of state and legislative practices. Even though Tanguay (2021, p. 742) identifies the Liberty Party of Canada and the Conservative Party of Canada as the major parties, other research has also highlighted minority parties in Canada. These encompass New Democratic Party, Green Party, and the Quebec nationalist Bloc (Tanguay 2021, p. 742). Just like the other two predominant parties in Canada, these minority parties have found significance in Canada which presents a different scenario when compared to other parties in the United States, apart from the discussed major parties.
Political Culture
Culturally, the two nations under scrutiny exhibit distinct political orientations from one another. The exhaustive literature exploration found that Canada has embraced an egalitarian kind of leader for decades (Budd 2019, p. 138). This leadership model benefits citizens significantly since it supports social amenities and fosters economic freedom and multiculturalism. Hence, Canada emphasizes social parity, which encompasses individual rights and inclusivity (Budd 2019, p. 143). The Canadian political system is democratic, culminating in universal healthcare, gun control, and social and foreign aid programs. Conversely, American political culture could be well elucidated based on Elazar’s theory. Elazar’s theory posits that American political culture is segmented into distinct cultures, encompassing moralistic, individualist, and traditionalistic (López 2022, p. 100367). Elazar’s theory portrays American political culture as moralistic in that the government is perceived as a means that caters to society by ensuring citizens’ well-being (López 2022, p. 100367). Moralistic political culture bolsters transparency and honesty, which are the fundamental pillars of democracy.
Elazar’s theory also argues that the United States system could also be experiencing an individualist
