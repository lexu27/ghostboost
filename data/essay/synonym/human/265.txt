In the evolution of nursing in Europe during the 19th century, the efforts of a remarkable individual, the Englishwoman Florence Nightingale, played a crucial role. Florence sought a chance to assist the impoverished and the ailing. During that remote era, tasks associated with compassion, aiding those in distress, were viewed as an occupation not suitable for a noblewoman. The young lady gave up personal life and valuable relationships with her parents but stayed devoted to her vocation. Additionally, her principles and dedication enabled Florence to emerge as a prominent figure in contemporary nursing, to whom people are indebted for advancing the position of nursing in our communities.

Through persistence and determination, in 1851, Florence joined the congregation of the sisters of pastor F. Flender in Germany, where she underwent a nursing training. Subsequently, Florence made a significant contribution not just to the management of cholera and assistance in conflicts but also to the enhancement of leadership and the restructuring of nursing (Kim, 2020). The altruistic lady became a model of serving humanity and a symbol of global compassion. Furthermore, Florence succeeded in altering a prevailing notion about the nobility of nursing; her guidance facilitated the restoration of a fundamental understanding of nursing practice. Her importance can be aptly illustrated on a medal bearing her likeness, which is bestowed for exceptional contributions to distinguished nurses.

A substantial part in the advancement of nursing internationally falls to the global organization of the Red Cross. The International Committee for Relief of the Wounded, led by A. Dunant, organized a gathering in Geneva in October 1863 with representatives from 13 nations, during which the constitution of the International Red Cross was formulated, and the symbol of the society was adopted. The United States made significant strides in the progression of nursing in the 19th-20th centuries, with the establishment of the American Medical Association. (AMA) (Kim, 2020). In 1873, the first three nursing institutions in the USA were inaugurated following the model of the F. Nightingale schools in London (Kim, 2020). Therefore, the continued development of international humanitarian groups was chiefly made feasible by leaders like Florence.
