The human brain and awareness pose many obstacles to scientists, and various investigations enable them to uncover different occurrences, particularly in the realm of self-consciousness. The film "Human Awareness" (2014) from BBC offers audiences a glimpse into various tests that researchers carry out to delve into the aspects of the operation of the human brain. The most remarkable trial in the documentary was the mirror self-recognition examination, and ongoing research indicates that it is greatly impacted by sociocultural elements.
Even though the mirror self-recognition examination is rather straightforward and does not demand many resources, it helps researchers comprehend the capability of individuals to identify themselves. Essentially, the objective of the mirror self-recognition examination is to gauge a child's awareness of themselves. The trial unfolds in line with three primary phases, which must be strictly adhered to. The initial phase entails allowing the child to approach a sizable mirror and spend several minutes gazing at their reflection. The subsequent step involves the caregiver of the child placing a small mark on the child's cheek near the mouth where it can be seen. The third phase implies once more positioning the child in front of the mirror and permitting them to observe the reflection. The child succeeds in the examination if they touch the mark, proving that they possess self-awareness and can connect the image of the mark visible in the reflection to the one on their body. The cinematic experiment exhibited that children start to display signs of self-recognition solely from the age of 18 months.
Simultaneously, as the present research indicates, sociocultural elements also wield a significant influence on the child's ability to ace the mirror self-recognition examination. The analysis conducted by Cebioğlu & Broesch (2021) probed the cross-cultural facet embedded in the examination. The aim of the study was to ascertain whether children brought up in diverse social and cultural settings exhibited different success rates for the mirror self-recognition examination. Furthermore, the study aimed to determine if extraneous variables such as motivation impacted the child's proficiency in passing the examination. Precisely, the investigators recruited 57 infants spanning in age from 18 to 22 months. The infants hailed from two distinct sociocultural milieus, namely, rural Vanuatu, a small group of islands in the South Pacific, and urban Canada. To carry out the experiment, the researchers utilized a traditional version of the examination and marked the face of each participant before allowing them to gaze into the mirror.
The outcomes of the study were substantial and distinctly showcased that social and cultural factors wielded a considerable impact on children's ability to pass the examination. Specifically, the experiment demonstrated that 68% of the children from the Canadian urban setting succeeded in the examination. In contrast, only a mere 7% of children from Vanuatu who partook in the experiment passed the examination. Fundamentally, the results enabled the researchers to grasp that the sociocultural setting was indicative of the child's capability to exhibit self-awareness. Additionally, the investigation also ascertained that variables such as children's motivation to display the mark did not influence the experiment. In essence, self-growth was the sole factor that influenced the child's proficiency in passing the examination.
The mirror self-recognition examination illustrated in the "Human Awareness" film empowers researchers to acquire insight into human self-awareness. Experiments reveal that children below 18 months of age typically struggle to pass the examination. Concurrently, the findings of the study conducted by Cebioğlu & Broesch suggest that sociocultural factors also hold significant importance when assessing children's capacity to recognize themselves.
