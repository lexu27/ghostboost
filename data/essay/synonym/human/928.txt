Commencement and Basis of the Investigation Project
Various categories of inoculations have been produced in the United States and Europe to alleviate the repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, AstraZeneca/Oxford, and Johnson & Johnson vaccines are among them. These immunizations are derived from intricate and extensive procedures that ideally require numerous years to finalize. However, the Coronavirus immunization was formulated in under two years. Consequently, it is crucial to comprehend the technology and biochemical features of the vaccine development process that facilitated this accomplishment.
The Emergence of a New Menace
A few clinical issues could become so pressing and pertinent to the global schedule that their emergence caused radical modifications in all areas of human existence. One of the primary threats to the global health system is the recent COVID-19 caused by the pathogenic virus known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This ailment should be considered new due to the mutational incident, which enabled the pathogen to acquire distinct and persistent evolutionary attributes. In turn, the formation of new coronavirus varieties made it impracticable for the existing healthcare systems to promptly react to the emerging threat due to the lack of experience in handling this pathogen. Hence, the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 posed a significant challenge to the global agenda, revealing the inadequate performance of health systems against the emergence of novel threats.
It is not solely the medical sector that has been severely impacted. The substantial strain on health systems has negatively affected virtually all domains of public life. Incapable of managing the significantly heightened influx of crisis patients, hospitals were inundated and inefficient in aiding in coping with the incessant pace of the pandemic. Consequently, most governments had to enforce stringent restrictive measures prohibiting social contacts, public amenities, and significant events. This resulted in the collapse of small and medium-sized enterprises, compelling many commercial entities to shut down and disrupt supply chains. Furthermore, to contain the rapid rate of infections, many nations rapidly sealed borders and suspended the issuance of visas, justifying the decision on national security grounds. As a consequence of the new threat, all spheres have come under pressure, signifying that public life, grounded on the principles of globalism, has been impeded.
Facts about the Coronavirus
Coronaviruses are a well-studied group of viral particles containing RNA molecules as genetic material. The name of this family was ascribed to viruses solely because of the similarity of their morphological structure to the solar corona. The lipoprotein envelope of the virus has several spike-like peplomers designed for efficient binding to cell receptors, as illustrated in Figure 1 below.

SARS-CoV-2 is entirely in alignment with this description and appears to be a naturally occurring virus, though this standpoint still lacks a clear academic evaluation. A central argument in the assumption of a natural origin of the virus causing COVID-19 is the high similarity to SARS-CoV, which triggered the SARS epidemic in 2002. Conversely, genomic studies of the structure of the virus expose some inaccuracies and assumptions that enable opponents of the natural origin of the pathogen to discuss its laboratory production. For instance, the presence of a viral laboratory at the epicenter in Wuhan, China, and the phylogenetic differences from the progenitors, and the multiplicity of mutated forms provide the basis for skepticism. Simultaneously, the current virus displays a consistent inclination to evolve through mutagenic processes of genetic material. This generates a broad array of akin pathogens with diverse functionalities and makes it significantly more challenging to combat them effectively.
Morphological Features
The morphological and genomic characteristics of the virus have already been adequately studied. According to Varga et al. (2020), the virions are roughly spherical or oval, with an effective diameter of about 180 nanometers. Morphological analysis of the pathogen reveals the presence of multiple lipoprotein outgrowths of the viral envelope that fulfill the functional role of binding to target cell receptors and initiating mechanisms to trigger infection. Consequently, each peplomer comprises a protein S complex represented by three proteins. S 1 at the top of the spike interacts with the target cell receptors, while S 2 and S 2 ‘ facilitate a biochemical fusion of the viral envelope with the host cell membrane to facilitate the injection of genomic material. Figure 2 below displays different color codes for the varied types of proteins characterizing the virus and how they bind in the human body to cause infections.

Notably, each peplomer is generally mobile and operates as a hinge mechanism, signifying that the attachment of SARS-CoV-2 to the cell surface proves to be more efficient for the virus. Besides these proteins, the viral particle also encompasses biopolymers forming the nucleocapsid envelope as displayed in Figure 1 above. Such proteins package the viral RNA and play an essential role in the assembly of the viral particle, though the structure of the coronavirus nucleocapsid is not currently elucidated in any detail. From the known information, it should be noted that the internal proteins of the capsid are bound in a chain no thicker than 15 nanometers, with the capsid as a whole not occupying the entire free volume of the pathogenic particle. Within the nucleocapsid, as is customary for viruses, there is genomic material.
Genomic Features
SARS-CoV-2 is a typical RNA-containing coronavirus with reliable morphological evidence of belonging to this taxon. The virus encompasses a single-stranded RNA measuring approximately 29.8 base pairs. The genome itself comprises six open reading frames, characteristic of all coronaviruses, and genes unique to SARS-CoV-2 responsible for synthesizing matrix and nucleocapsid proteins. SARS-CoV-2 should be categorized under the beta-coronaviruses among which there is SARS-CoV, which caused SARS pneumonia. This allows the current pathogen to be assessed as closely related to preexisting forms but mutated and having crossed the interspecies barrier.
Aetiological Evidence
SARS-CoV-2 is a pathogen of the human respiratory system. The virus has the capacity to cause acute respiratory viral infections, including respiratory failure. Figure 3 below illustrates a sample of a functional and infected lung.

The critical entry gates for pathogen entry are the epithelium of the upper respiratory tract. Consequently, the mode of transmission of the virus involves inhaling air contaminated with viral particles, especially in proximity to the source of infection, namely a sick person or hospital. SARS-CoV-2 initially attaches to target cells that have ACE2 receptors, including in the cells of the nasopharynx. Figure 4 below illustrates how the pathogen penetrates through the hemolytic barrier of the lung to cause infections.

Infection could result in a change in a patient’s sense of smell at an early stage of the disease and may be indicative of nasopharyngeal mucosal edema.
