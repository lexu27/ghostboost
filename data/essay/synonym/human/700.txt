The populace of interest comprised of American individuals from all 50 states of the USA and the District of Columbia aged 18 and above. Broadly, the populace of interest was represented by arbitrary 1038 American individuals who are permitted to engage in political processes and altering laws. Consequently, any American individual who is in the voting age and resides in the United States is the target audience of the investigation.

Respondents within a household were chosen based on their birth date; the individual with the latest birth date became the participant.
Each example consisted of a minimum quota of 400 cellphone respondents and 600 landline respondents per 1000 national adults (Saad 2012). Throughout the investigation, a total of 1038 adults residing in the U.S. were interviewed.
The subjects were contacted via landline telephones and cellular phones. As the respondents were chosen arbitrarily, numerous interviews were conducted in Spanish for respondents who predominantly speak Spanish.
