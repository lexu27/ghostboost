American enslavement emerged as a means of exploiting labor within capitalism but gradually evolved in an independent socio-economic and political framework. Over time, a freedom movement commenced, which suggested the unlawfulness and unethical "ownership" of individuals. Nonetheless, even post-official liberation, the enslaved individuals relied on the government and slave masters previously, lacking the means for sustenance. Without paperwork, financial means, and ethical encouragement, it was challenging for new members of society to assimilate into a conventional lifestyle. Moreover, bias and absence of inclusion as a phenomenon persisted.

Enslavement was eradicated due to the Civil War between the northern and southern states. The ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment to the US Constitution in January 1865 brought a lasting conclusion to enslavement in the US, rendering it unlawful and unconstitutional. Presently, this phenomenon in the United States is regarded as one of the most disgraceful incidents in the nation's history. Simultaneously, a pressing issue emerges regarding whether the government should have compensated the enslaved individuals for the material and spiritual harm inflicted upon them during the process.

Even if forced labor is not officially sanctioned and the enslaved individuals are liberated, without the provision of essential resources for survival, existence is improbable. The perception and stance of society also impact the assimilation rate of new members. In instances of unequal opportunities to access identical benefits, the formerly enslaved individuals encounter more obstacles, hardships, and intricacies on the journey of integration. In this context, the new slaves were not genuinely emancipated, as they were still reliant on a resource of means for sustenance.
