The bond between Nora and Torvald progresses significantly during the performance and ultimately reveals a completely distinct aspect of each of these personas. Initially, they appear to be an ideal pair, both satisfied with their positions within the household. However, as the performance unfolds, they are exposing their toxic relationship and discontent. Torvald treats his spouse like a child incapable of making her own choices. He is primarily concerned with his finances and reputation, and through his coercion and conceit, he convinces Nora that her existence must solely revolve around her spouse and offspring. Nora perceives her mission similarly: her sole endeavor is to please her spouse. Nora and Torvald's connection illustrates that the autonomy of women was not always acknowledged, and that for numerous men, women were and are merely "dolls" (Gardner et al., 2020). Nevertheless, subsequent to Nora unveiling her spouse's authentic self, she recognizes that he is a self-absorbed individual who genuinely does not value her. She becomes more resilient and resolves to depart from her family to educate herself and ascertain her own mission. The bond between Kristine and Krogstad has also progressed through various phases. In contradiction to Nora and Torvald, Kristine was the one who valued finances more and ultimately abandoned Krogstad, despite the fact that she indeed cherished him. This led Krogstad to become a resentful, desolate, and miserable individual, which demonstrates that he genuinely cherished her as well. What rescues him in the conclusion is Kristine, who extends a second opportunity for them to reunite. It seems that his incentive is not acquiring wealth or esteem from society; instead, all he sought was love, empathy, and sincerity. The fundamental contrast between these two pairs is that Kristine and Krogstad adore each other, which enables them to converse and address their issues to reconcile after several years of disconnection.
