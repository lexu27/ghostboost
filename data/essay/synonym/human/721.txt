Authors' utilization of diverse semantic significances in their imaginative works is conventionally linked with the writer's internal wish to convey a specific idea through that representation. Readers who examine literature autonomously often interpret these significances based on their personal background, indicating that the employment of the same components by distinct authors or even in different works by the same author might not be perceived uniformly. Conversely, it is frequently the scenario where dissimilar writers aim to present similar significances to works employing identical semantic depictions. Among these, the significance of opposition, accomplished through the incorporation of gloomy and bright representations, is notably remarkable. The most prominent application of somber styles can be seen in John Milton's Paradise Lost and William Shakespeare's Othello. In these enduring works of verse, somber imagery is extensively employed by the writers to reinforce the contrast to bright styles; however, the dramatists also demonstrated that darkness should not be categorically interpreted. This article seeks to qualitatively examine the utilization of such significances in the two aforementioned works.
A pivotal theme of Shakespeare's enduring calamity is the contrast of contradictions. The reader is informed of this nearly from the outset when the lead character Othello is presented as an African of Moorish lineage. For sixteenth-century British poetry, incorporating dark-skinned figures in significant plot roles was innovative because prejudiced slogans in societal attitudes were still prevalent. This is vividly exemplified in Othello, where the dark-skinned protagonist, which inevitably evokes notions of "uncivilized Africans," is revealed to be an honorable and devout character. Thus, one of the primary and most evident uses of somber imagery is intended to highlight Shakespeare's intention of illustrating that not everything "dark" is inherently malevolent and negative, as it may appear initially.
Nevertheless, it would be inaccurate to assert that Shakespeare did not utilize somber imagery, among other aspects, to unveil a murky, concealed style. The tragedy of Othello is filled with numerous applications of somber symbols and personalities to underscore the protagonist's malevolence. One of these is Iago's subordinate, whose conduct is frequently depicted within the context of a profound, somber night. Contrasted with the celestial, radiant Desdemona, who conventionally adorns white garments, Iago emerges as a sinister fool whose intentions and deeds are linked with self-serving wickedness. Hence, it is apt to suggest that the integration of the dark image in Othello was also indispensable to emphasize the demarcation between virtue and vice.
Somber styles to intensify the opposition with bright depictions are effectively employed in another composition post-Elizabethan England, specifically Paradise Lost by John Milton. Milton incorporates dark hues in his biblical narratives to symbolize the Devil's authority. The application of somber hues to augment the foreboding ambiance is notably conspicuous at the commencement of book three when the playwright employs terms such as "obscure," "eternal night," and "darkness" (Milton 45). This is utilized to contrast with the radiant angels and God, which Milton portrays in terms of divine-bright tones. These notions are drawn from the biblical writer John, who explicitly inscribed that "...God is light; in him, there is no darkness at all" (1 Jh. 1:5). Consequently, the utilization of somber imagery in Milton's composition is executed to accentuate the distinction between brightness and darkness, good and evil.
