Given that the Greeks were more predisposed to embrace everything novel, it is unsurprising that numerous of the initial Christian congregations were established on their territories. Christian societies thrived and expanded in urban centers like Patras, Corinth, Thessaloniki, Philippi, and Athens. The practice of Christian designating caused a reduction of ‘tria nomina’ primarily in these regions and subsequently throughout the entire empire (Kantola & Nuorluoto, 2022). Originally, ‘tria nomina’ comprised praenomen, nomen, and cognomen (Figure 1). Nonetheless, later Roman titles were abbreviated and utilized alongside Greek titles.
For several reasons, the Roman titling structure crumbled some time after the decline of imperial authority in the West. The praenomen had already become inadequate in documented sources in the fourth century, and by the fifth century, it was conserved only by the most conservative factions of the former Roman aristocracy (Kantola & Nuorluoto, 2022). As Roman establishments and societal frameworks gradually vanished during the sixth century, the necessity to differentiate between nomens and cognomens also vanished. Conversely, the Greek titling framework spread throughout the region. By the conclusion of the seventh century, the populace of Western Europe had completely reverted to individual titles. Nonetheless, numerous of the titles that originated within the ‘trial nomina’ have been adjusted for usage and have endured to the present.
Hence, it can be deduced that the Greek titling system, initially utilized solely for slaves and attendants, prevailed over a more esteemed Roman counterpart. On one side, the grounds for this were the transformation of the societal structure, where social classes gradually became less noticeable, and, on the other hand, the emergence of Christian concepts within Greece. Furthermore, the innate inclination for abbreviation played a noteworthy role in this progression, rendering the Greek titling system more desirable than the Roman one.
