The establishment of societal reality is one of the concepts of great interest to contemporary scientific knowledge. Ultimately, science progresses to enable the application of acquired knowledge technologically in the process of transformative practice for the advantage of humanity and nature. In this context, societal reality emerges due to the relevant technological perspective, and the procedural technique emerges as a communal construction of reality (Lancet, 2013). The configuration of societal reality, both in terms of shaping a public image and in defining technological alteration of the world, discloses the process of establishing a New World Order and its execution through global processes. The primary form of societal organization of reality is human activity, exemplified by material and spiritual creations. The aim of societal construction is to develop universal patterns in which individuals and groups of people shape the reality they observe. The study of constructing societal reality investigates how individuals standardize social phenomena and convert them into customs.
Undoubtedly, individuals adapt their self-image to present themselves to others as they desire to be perceived. For instance, when seeking employment, individuals may attribute merits that they did not earn. Consequently, this may aid them in securing the desired position. Social engagement is characterized by the reciprocally conditioned impact of social entities on one another. Every individual must undertake various situational roles throughout their lifetime. An individual engages with diverse individuals and social collectives daily (Fleming, 2006). It is uncommon for them to exclusively interact with members of a single group, such as a family. Simultaneously, they might also be part of a work team, public organizations, and so forth. By being members of numerous social groups concurrently, they assume a corresponding role in each group based on their connections with other group members. This is also essential for fulfilling a specific social role, such as securing employment. Nonetheless, each individual necessitates a personalized approach, necessitating adaptability.
