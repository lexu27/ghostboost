It should be mentioned that the Undercover Boss episode of Rita’s Ice displays the interaction of the company CEO, Linda L. Chadwick, with several of her franchisees. The chosen job roles for the examination are franchisee proprietor and treat crew member. The initial job role is franchisee proprietor based on the instance of Hezrron, and the second one is a treat crew member position based on the instance of Pastiche. The examination reveals that the initial job role demands a broad array of entrepreneurial skills and capabilities since the franchise owner is essentially a business owner who must adhere to the corporate standards. The second position is exclusively concentrated on cashier duties, which highlights human interactions as well as the capacity to conduct financial transactions. The resemblance of the two positions is demonstrated in the reality that financial proficiency and communication abilities are crucial in both instances. Nevertheless, the initial position also necessitates additional operational and organizational management competencies. The information gathering for each job role examination utilizes one-on-one interviews on-site, indicating that both practical observations and additional questioning can be conducted. The primary difficulties and problems can also be deduced on site since the interview is being carried out while the job roles are being executed.
