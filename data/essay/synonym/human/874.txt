The section primarily concentrates on the moral assessment of BP’s choices concerning spill control through the perspective of utilitarianism. The latter deems an action moral or immoral based on the overall result and advantages (Halbert and Ingulli 1). When examining BP’s choices and activities, it is crucial to involve all stakeholders. Firstly, the cost-benefit examination reveals that BP sustained substantial losses due to fines, penalties, lawsuits, and impaired business. Nevertheless, both enduring and immediate impacts must be taken into account. Secondly, stockholders of the business also suffered significant losses.
Thirdly, the laborers, who endured the spill, and other experts engaged in the cleanup were killed, critically wounded, or experienced other health consequences. Fourthly, the Gulf region is a greatly valuable ecosystem for fishing and other marine life forms. It is still uncertain how extensive the damage will be on the native fauna, but it is apparent that the chemical particles will not mysteriously vanish and will persist in the ecosystem.
Fifthly, the local enterprises, authorities, and communities are deeply reliant on the Gulf’s ecosystem for a broad array of grounds. The spill influenced the fishing, tourism, and well-being of individuals residing close to the region. Despite the FDA asserting that seafood is secure to consume, it is still uncertain whether or not longitudinal health consequences will emerge (Halbert and Ingulli 3). Sixthly, the Gulf region is crucial for the natural surroundings beyond it as fish, birds, and other marine life forms utilize the site for breeding, migration, and other forms of behavior. Consequently, BP’s choice not to utilize a backup switch will lead to detrimental repercussions, but its choice to partake in deep-water drilling might balance out in regards to economic advantages to the nation.
