Posture and body movements are instances of body language. A vertical position, for example, communicates assurance; the same applies to physical movements. Seated erect and inclining ahead on the chair, for instance, exhibits attentiveness and concentration in the discussion, but a relaxed reclining back stance might suggest indifference or supremacy. Though appearances can be misleading, not all of them are significant in professional interaction. Ponder the scenario of a sales representative presenting a luxury fashion item. The attire and shoes they put on would showcase their individual style as well as their fashion proficiency crucial for promoting the products. Actions are performances that are carried out automatically or habitually, like drumming fingernails on a table, tilting the head from side to side, or resting palms on the cheekbones. Even if unintended, particular actions might convey the incorrect impression. For instance, an employee might place his forehead in his palms while deeply contemplating, which could be misinterpreted as disinterest.

In my viewpoint, I interpret body language favorably. When an individual executes some form of motion to focus, I consistently mimic it. I regard my strongest aspect in non-verbal interaction. This means of communication accompanies everyone from birth, and though this form is well developed for everyone, interpretation is not always at the desired level. Mostly, I study body language by observing people's conduct in cafes and other public venues; through this method, I manage to scrutinize the maximum feasible number of individuals, enabling me to comprehend them better. Appearance is intricate for me; I cannot always grasp what a person intends to convey with their appearance, but I aspire to nurture such a talent within myself since, in my opinion, it is crucial.

The capability to encode effective turn-taking messages can aid in ensuring that individuals can uphold the floor when required in a conversation or make their way into a conversation successfully, without unfairly interrupting someone or appearing disrespectful. Encoding is the act of transforming concepts into data. The encoder dispatches a message through channels such as a phone call, web, text or email, face-to-face meeting, or another communication medium. The level of deliberate thought dedicated to encoding signals fluctuates. The encoder should take into account other directives, distractions, or enticements, as well as any interference that might clash with their signal.

In my perspective, I articulate my ideas effectively in non-verbal language; at least individuals have consistently grasped what I am attempting to convey to them. I can affirm that body language is fundamental and transparent to me. Nevertheless, akin to interpretation, I encounter challenges in discerning how to manifest a certain wish to the conversationalist through appearance. I aspire to cultivate this ability as it is exceedingly versatile in daily life and can be advantageous in numerous situations.

Enforcing the recommendations for becoming a more proficient encoder of nonverbal will culminate in enhanced interpretation capacity due to heightened awareness. Competent interpreters of nonverbal information are deemed to possess nonverbal consciousness, which, akin to adept encoders, leads to more substantial social connections, esteem, and diminished social anxiety (Burgoon). I am convinced that the capability to express one's thoughts not solely with words but also through body movements, appearance, and gestures are valuable proficiencies that can be employed in all facets of an individual's life to streamline and enrich life.
