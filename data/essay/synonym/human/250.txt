The exploration indicated that bibliometric examination of proof collected from integrative evaluations and analytical studies had significant repercussions for nurse-related and evidence based policy adjustments. Chiefly, this is feasible through the utilization of integrative evaluations in formulating new programs (Benton et al., 2020). The combined database of the synthesized studies as proposed by the authors of the research, can be used by nurses to be empowered through evidence-based materials in the creation of modifications in universal health coverage. Therefore, the relevance of this information has several advantages for working nurses, as they will be able to utilize succinct and reliable resources when advocating or implementing adjustments to policy. I believe that nursing practice can be greatly enhanced with the use of well-managed databases that employ evidence-based research. This is because such a database will be capable of illustrating gaps in knowledge of overarching issues as well as daily medical practices in the field of nursing (Houser, 2016). Similarly, it permits insight into nurse-specific fields such as nurse education, care for the elderly, emergency care, and more.
Presently, accessibility to extensive and thorough information that is shaped through evidence-based research is restricted due to various factors. To better provide such informative materials among working nurses it is crucial to diminish bureaucratic procedures and incorporate technology into the process. Contemporary technology enables low-cost and time-saving methods of information sharing, which will be highly advantageous for nursing. As mentioned previously, evidence-based research has the potential to uncover gaps in information in nurse-specific practices that would otherwise be unnoticed. I deem it necessary to make such knowledge accessible and coherent to promote better nursing care and work quality.
