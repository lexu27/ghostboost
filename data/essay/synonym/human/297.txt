Introduction
The legal system in the United States of America was crafted to achieve a variety of specific societal and ethical objectives. It serves a retributive function, penalizing those considered to be unlawful or ethically deficient. Conversely, justice is also procedural, determining how individuals in society should be treated. Justice can also be restorative, aiming to reintegrate individuals back into society. The prioritization of these goals depends on the individual. Once a person completes their sentence and is released from prison, it is generally expected that they will be able to become a fully functioning member of society, capable of abiding by its rules and regulations. However, in numerous instances, individuals commit additional offenses after being released.
These kinds of individuals are frequently referred to as repeat offenders, habitual offenders, or career offenders. Current systems of post-conviction integration and the associated safety nets are significantly inadequate, resulting in many individuals struggling outside of prison. In most cases, a repeat offender is unable to fully adjust to life outside of the criminal justice system, leading them to revert to the only lifestyle they are familiar with â€“ lawlessness. Due to this reality, the US legislation also includes specific laws and guidelines for working with those who have prior involvement with the justice system. The presence of Career offender guidelines aims to reduce instances of recidivism and discourage criminal behavior. However, the actual efficacy of such methods varies significantly. This review will primarily discuss career offender guidelines and their effectiveness within the justice system.
Overview
Career Offenders
First, the label "career offender" itself can be examined. An individual is classified as a serial offender when they meet several criteria, including being over 18 years old at the time of a crime, being convicted of a violent or drug-related offense, and having at least two previous similar offenses (Burnham & Gorokhov, 2017). Meeting all of the aforementioned criteria designates one as a career offender within the US justice system. Upon receiving such a status, it entails various penalties, primarily focusing on the severity of sentencing. Typically, the minimum charge in court is elevated, rendering any potential criminal consequences more severe than they would have been otherwise (Burnham & Gorokhov, 2017). Furthermore, the criminal history of an individual deemed a career offender is categorized more severely. The amalgamation of these factors results in most career offenders spending more time in the prison system. An individual has the ability to dispute their classification, and not all individuals are eligible for the designation of a career offender.
While the career offender system was established to prevent repeat offenses and deter criminal activity, the actual sentencing enhancements were not established using empirical data. All of the increased sentences provided under this legislation are approximations. Additionally, it can be observed that the career offender system disregards many forms of crime prevalent in society. Corporate crime, theft, and inappropriate actions against others are not encompassed by the repeat offender guidelines.
This approach renders the system particularly susceptible to being ineffective or targeting certain demographics more than others. Due to the correlation between specific living conditions, income, and poverty, drug and violence-related sentencing disproportionately impacts social groups (Blankenship et al., 2018). Particularly, black individuals are much more likely to be prosecuted for drug-related offenses. Concerning the career offender guidelines, this implies that black individuals and other people of color encounter greater challenges in exiting the prison system (Blankenship et al., 2018). Even in instances where an individual manages to complete their sentence, the actual process of readjusting to normal life often becomes excessively challenging. A discrepancy between sentencing outcomes and treatment adversely affects the well-being of non-white communities. Black men, historically the most vulnerable demographic within the prison system, are isolated from their communities and left incapable of assimilating.
Three-Strike Law
The three-strike law is a more general manner of referring to systems such as the career offender guidelines. As indicated by the name, these guidelines impose severe penalties on individuals after they have been convicted three times. Devised to heighten the punishment for repeat offenders, the actual execution of the laws varies by state. In comparison to the career offender guidelines, the three-strike approach concentrates on specific types of felonies. Most states have enacted this law with differing levels of severity. Life sentences pose a significant issue concerning the three-strike law, as the majority of individuals are sentenced to life imprisonment following their actions. In California, for instance, no consideration is given to the time elapsed between each offense, signifying that a person can receive a life sentence due to something they committed many years ago.
Furthermore, the three-strikes legislation also shares resemblances with the career offender guidelines. The political aspect of criminal comprehension is intensified within this framework, and crimes deemed more socially reprehensible are more likely to warrant enhanced sentencing. Researchers also assert that it is unlikely to be effective in preventing crime and instead exacerbates social inequality. As discussed in the work "Reimagining Criminal Justice," the law was initially enacted to segregate socially detrimental individuals and outcasts from others and safeguard societal well-being. This meant that individuals such as murderers and rapists would have fewer opportunities to re-offend (Flores, 2020). However, with the current iteration of the law, most individuals under its influence serve sentences for non-violent crimes. The three-strike system fails to achieve its stated objectives and actively worsens the livelihoods of lesser offenders.
First Step Act
The third notable piece of legislation is the First Step Act. In comparison to the two aforementioned laws, this legislation is utilized to assist repeat offenders in improving their status. Enacted relatively recently, in 2018, the act was pledged to lead to reduced recidivism. The legislation was designed to reduce existing unnecessarily lengthy prison sentences while also providing offenders with a framework for self-improvement. Additionally, it aimed to ameliorate the current prison conditions. Inhumane and violent practices within prisons are curtailed by the new legislation, mitigating the physical and mental strain prisoners endure. Moreover, the First Step Act affords judges more flexibility in assigning reduced sentences to repeat offenders. Shortly after its enactment, 3100 inmates had the opportunity to be reintegrated into society following sentence reductions (The first step act of 2018: An overview). The impact of the act was immediate, with individuals beginning to serve shorter prison terms (The first step act of 2018: An overview). Nonetheless, the overall efficacy of the law remains to be fully ascertained, as it has not been universally implemented.
Recommendation
I strongly oppose the current implementation of career offender legislation and analogous initiatives. While the stated objectives of more rigorous punishment as a deterrent are evident, their practical effectiveness in real-life scenarios is heavily contested. As evidenced by numerous researchers and analyses, the primary achievement of repeat offender laws is consistently escalating the prison population. They do not facilitate reintegration into society, are detrimental to communities, and do not serve as an adequate deterrent. Present laws actively impede individuals from progressing through the justice system. As indicated by current research, the system of career offender guidelines is predominantly inhumane, falls short of achieving its stated objectives, and is detrimental to society at large (Saltzman, 2019). The career offender laws target specific categories of criminals, notably those linked to drugs and violence, and subject them to considerably harsher sentences than they might otherwise receive.
