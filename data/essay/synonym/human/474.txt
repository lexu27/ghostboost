The consequence of pesticide application can be disastrous for nature and the ecosystem because they impact health, animals, flora, and living conditions. Their threat to bees’ conduct indicates that the accumulation of substances is serious for pollination, crucial for plants and seeds development, and food production. Recent research and organizations such as The Environmental Protection Agency urge the government and manufacturers to take action against pesticides to prevent the disappearance of entire insect populations (Lawler, 2017). The artificial alterations in the ecosystem can result in catastrophic outcomes, natural calamities, poor yields, and water contamination (Matyjaszczyk, 2018). Consequently, practical measures need to be taken to tackle the issue, and vectors control or integrated pest management (IPM) are the significant methods to initiate from.
Pesticides usage is evolving into a worldwide issue, hence the United Nations, World Health Organization, and World Wide Fund for Nature must address the predicament. For instance, encouraging businesses and households to practice IPM for sustainable progress in reducing pest utilization. The notion of assessing if specific biological products are essential for agriculture is profound for the enhancement and selection of eco-friendly alternatives (Matyjaszczyk, 2018). Vectors’ management impacts the environmental condition, and promoting the adoption of proper practices can be achieved through exploration and societal programs dedicated to the significance of distinct insect species. Lawler (2017) asserts that “Health agencies, the public, and environmental groups have particularly discussed the use of methoprene because some studies have indicated toxic effects on non-target organisms” (p. 337). The perilous adverse effects have to be disclosed to the public to compel industries to reduce the pesticide application in vectors control.
