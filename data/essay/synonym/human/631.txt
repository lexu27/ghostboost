In her publication Doughnut Economics, Kate Raworth explores the primary elements of the contemporary economy, the obstacles of economic expansion, and adjustments to be encouraged in society. Despite my wish to find a meaning in economics, reading economic literature is not always simple to follow. Most books and articles consist of different intricate terms and descriptions that perplex and intimidate a beginner reader. I respect the approach chosen by Raworth that sets her apart from other theorists by examining economics from new angles that can be intriguing to non-economists. It is always a responsible move for me to study the initial chapters and understand if the entire book could capture my attention over time. At this point, I had an opportunity to study the introduction "Who Wants to Be an Economist?" and the first chapter, "Change the Goal." Each segment has its objective, and my key realization is that it is vital for modern economists to modify something immediately to attain positive results with time.
An introduction of the book is a great chance for me to grasp the primary questions raised in the book and develop several personal and professional expectations. Raworth (2017) commences her discussion by mentioning the name of an ordinary student, Yuan Yang, who opted to study economics and became disheartened about her choice soon. On one side, I have numerous questions regarding such a questionable decision to start the book about economics with severe criticism of economic theories and education in general. Raworth (2017) asserts that students either "walked away from economics or swallowed its theories whole and built a lucrative career out of their qualification" (p. 2). I believe that not many individuals would like to proceed with studying the subject after such candid and provocative statements. On the other hand, I observe that the author challenges the reader and herself with the necessity to demonstrate that economics is worthy of attention and research if correct priorities are established. Hence, I desired to continue reading the segment and discover Raworth's attitude toward economics that enabled her to formulate the Doughnut concept.
The financial crisis, student demonstrations, and a symbolic revolution of economics are the themes that enhance my desire to continue reading. I think that, instead of endorsing the readers in their decisions to study economics, Raworth (2017) deliberately emphasizes that it is high time to disclose perplexing old ideas and substitute them with new ones for motivation. I concur with the choice to address statistical facts, encompassing the number of individuals living in poverty, issues of unemployment, overpopulation, and climate change, to support her stance (Raworth, 2017). I appreciate the notion of merging environmental, social, and economic concerns to demonstrate why to study economics from a fresh perspective. Mentioning such economists as John Maynard Keynes, Friedrich von Hayek, and Paul Samuelson prompts me to browse the internet and enrich my background knowledge concerning the significance of economic history and theoretical groundwork. Towards the conclusion of this segment, I comprehend the essence of Doughnut Economics, with seven ways to consider a modern economist. These encompass changing the goal, perceiving the big picture, nurturing human nature, becoming savvy with systems, designing to distribute, creating to regenerate, and being agnostic about growth (Raworth, 2017). Each component has seized my attention, and I wish to explore more about Doughnut Economics.
The chapter "Change the Goal" is dedicated to the initial layer of the doughnut in Raworth's theory. I am of the opinion that the core of traditional economic theory is that an individual's contentment is grounded on the power of consumption and utility of ideas (Raworth, 2017). I had never pondered that the expansion of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) ought to be the principal indicator of how prosperous or unsuccessful the economy is. Raworth (2017) shares the same viewpoint, and I admire her conciseness in acknowledging that society has been erroneously fixated on analyzing the circumstances under which GDP could be altered rather than concentrating on personal requirements and interests within available resources. I am encouraged by Raworth's call to alter the goal and support Doughnut's safety in shaping economies at local and global levels. I begin posing more queries about how to identify human and planet needs to be integrated into economic studies for attaining a dynamic equilibrium. Again, I find her focus on the works and expressions of globally recognized theorists and economists like Amartya Sen, Donella Meadows, Joseph Stiglitz, and Jean Sismondi as the vigor of this chapter. My insight is that it is insufficient to introduce a new concept about the value of economic change but to gather the viewpoints of diverse individuals and substantiate the correctness of her vision.
In general, my assessment of the provided readings is full of positive sentiments and appreciation to Kate Raworth for her contributions to a better comprehension of economic studies and their significance in human life. Concerning current social, political, and economic challenges, it is not always uncomplicated for an individual to select economics for an educational intent. However, at present, I am confident that my selection of the subject is accurate. I am keen to keep reading this publication and study six more ways to think like the 21st-century economist. Although economics has disappointed people, it is my obligation to alter things and enhance the overall situation in my country or even globally.
