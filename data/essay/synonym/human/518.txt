In the XVI-XVII centuries, during the High Renaissance and Baroque periods in Europe, faith unquestionably influenced the evolution of art. The religious disruptions significantly broadened the scope, introducing numerous icons, altars, stained glass windows, and other art pieces featuring religious themes. In this article, by analyzing a few specific artworks, we explore how faith served as a fundamental catalyst for the advancement of painting and was embedded in the underlying meanings of many pieces.

Michelangelo’s Sistine Chapel Ceiling, illustrating stories from the book of Genesis, is regarded as one of the supreme instances of Renaissance painting. It is segmented into 33 parts, each adorned with distinct scenes. The narrative of the book of Genesis is portrayed in nine central segments, while the remaining spaces exhibit Old Testament scenes and representations of Christ's forebears. Initially, Michelangelo envisioned vivid hues, but the colors dimmed and grew darker following the restoration. The figures' skin tones are faint peach, and the garments are depicted in soft pastel shades, imparting a sense of serenity and magnificence. This artwork predominantly mirrors Michelangelo as a profoundly devout and pious individual. The intricate and unconventional symbolism is viewed as a Neoplatonic explanation of the Bible, symbolizing the principal phases of humanity's spiritual growth and the intense connection between humanity and the divine (Gilbert, 2022). Transforming a seemingly insignificant ceiling area into such a masterpiece showcased a profound reverence for the religious themes of that era.

Isenheim Altarpiece by Grünewald was painted for the infirmary chapel of the Monastery of St. Anthony in Isenheim. The painting was crafted five years prior to Luther affixing his Protestant propositions to the portals of Wittenberg Cathedral in 1517, yet it perfectly captures the anguish of the early 16th century. In this context, Grunewald's anguished masterpiece stands in stark contrast to contemporary Italian creations of the High Renaissance. While the crucifixion is somber, almost deathly pallid, the other panels are distinguished by Grunewald's lively Renaissance color scheme, as well as his distinctive depictions of evil. The altarpiece confronts its observer through its portrayal of the stark reality of pain and prompts contemplation on how "good" can arise from it (Aramini, 2018). The religious undertones, concentrating on the torment and agony of Christ's crucifixion, wield a profound psychological impact on the beholder.
