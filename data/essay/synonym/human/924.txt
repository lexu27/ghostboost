Counseling individuals with HIV/AIDS is linked with significant emotional concerns. One of the main worries is the response to the diagnosis. According to Chippindale and French (2001), there is a broad range of responses to diagnosis considered typical, as some patients may take the news very calmly, while others will respond to the diagnosis with an extended period of distress, anger, and anxiety. Therefore, the key suggestion for human service professionals advising clients with HIV/AIDS is to allow time for the impact of the news to settle (Chippindale & French, 2001). The phase of impact may be succeeded by a phase of emotional release, which may involve overt tension (Chippindale & French, 2001). Hence, the primary advice for therapists who disclose diagnoses to clients is to remain composed and allow space for the client instead of taking instant action. The second suggestion is to place added emphasis on acquiring coping techniques. Specifically, the counselor should motivate the client to engage in the planning of care and in seeking suitable social assistance (Chippindale & French, 2001). Moreover, it is essential to collaborate with the clientâ€™s spouse, buddies, and family to ensure the best results (Chippindale & French, 2001). The counselor needs to recognize that it is impossible to be present for the client all the time; however, the friends and family may be there promptly when the client requires psychological support the most. This will aid the client to sustain an active lifestyle with minimal impact on everyday tasks. It is crucial to help the client accept all the prejudices linked with the illness and understand that life continues even after the diagnosis (Chippindale & French, 2001). Such approaches will enable stabilization of the client's emotional condition.
