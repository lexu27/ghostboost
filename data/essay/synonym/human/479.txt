The Coronavirus has significantly affected the overall health status of the global population for two primary reasons. One of them is the virus itself, as it adversely impacts people’s organisms, and the other is the challenges related to maintaining a favorable health condition in the pandemic situation. Therefore, it is crucial to stay physically active and engage in various exercises to keep one’s body in proper shape, enhance organism’s immunity, and decrease the likelihood of falling ill.

COVID-19 poses specific difficulties linked to sustaining a physically active lifestyle. As per Shariat et al. (2020), the primary risk factor for virus spread is individuals’ closeness to each other in groups, indicating that public gatherings are hazardous. Hence, public gyms and training areas may not be an ideal location to work out as they do not always offer sufficient space to maintain the required social distance. Nevertheless, it is even more critical nowadays to remain physically active as the coronavirus continues to produce new variations, signifying that regular exercise can avert potential problems and aid in maintaining individuals fit and healthy. The recommended workouts could involve wall push-ups, stair single-leg step-ups, shoulder lateral raises, jumping rope, or basic walking (Shariat et al., 2020). Engaging in these activities can assist individuals in remaining active and healthy during the quarantine.

In general, staying physically active is a crucial aspect of individuals’ lives, and its importance has increased due to COVID-19. It has presented numerous obstacles to physical training and emphasized the necessity of paying attention to body shape and health status. Participating in aerobic exercises and strength training can support individuals in staying physically active, enhancing their health, and diminishing the likelihood of contracting certain illnesses.
