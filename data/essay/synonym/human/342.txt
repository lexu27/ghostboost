An article published in Ahram Online provides details about the contentious remarks of TV host Ibrahim Eissa regarding the journey of Al-Miraj. El-Sayed Gamal El-Din, the writer of the article, initially gives a concise overview of the incident, followed by responses from the authorities and community, as well as historical information on previous news linked to Eissa. Furthermore, the article discloses details about the upcoming legal action concerning the statements of the TV host.

These aspects enable the reader to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the incident beyond the immediate news.

Based on the evaluation of codes of ethics, one can also deduce the impartiality and trustworthiness of this material. Impartiality dictates that all parties affected by the incident have an equal entitlement to be featured in the article. However, within the scope of the article by El-Sayed, insufficient attention is devoted to the viewpoint of Eissa himself, as well as his potential supporters. This aspect could introduce bias into the article, and additional information about the past actions of the TV host could foster a negative perception of the central figure of the story among readers. In terms of credibility, the article adheres to journalistic standards by presenting information sources and quotes, and refrains from relying on abstract assumptions.
