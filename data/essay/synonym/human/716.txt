Ethical selfishness is a normative theory that advocates that an individual’s own welfare is in line with the concept of morality. Ethical selfishness also does not require moral actors to bias the concerns and well-being of others by making their moral decisions. Therefore, ethical selfishness asserts that actions whose outcomes benefit the performer of these actions are moral. A conceivable moral decision in the scenario can also be construed from the perspective of the theory of existentialism and hedonism.
Perspective of the Theory of Ethical Egoism
On one side, it appears that Nora’s urge to replicate a friend’s report is consistent with the fundamental principles of ethical selfishness because she will gain from this deed. However, the concept of ethical selfishness does not necessarily mandate that, in the pursuit of one’s interests, individuals should always do what they desire if the fulfillment of immediate desires can detrimentally impact a person in the future. A carelessly copied report involves quite concrete consequences, and receiving a low grade is only one of them. If it is feasible to select a favorable option without harming others, then it is the correct choice. Framing a friend in this manner will not result in a positive outcome for Nora: she will lose her trust and tarnish her reputation. Thus, from the viewpoint of ethical selfishness, Nora must evaluate the risks and make a decision in favor of the minimum adverse consequences for herself, considering the potential of a damaged relationship with the friend, loss of reputation, a poor grade, as well as potential shame for her actions.
Perspective of Other Ethical Theories
One of the most advantageous theories relevant to the entire situation is the ethical theory of existentialism. Evaluation of Nora’s moral decision is impossible from the perspective of theories grounded on the outcome achieved during the analysis as it is indeterminate in this case. If Nora duplicates the work, both she and her friend face the risk of repercussions. Nonetheless, everything could progress smoothly, and the surreptitious work may go unnoticed. Another alternative is if Nora honestly informs the teacher that she lacks sufficient time to complete the work, the penalty might be mitigated. Nora could also seek assistance from her classmate; perhaps collectively, they will have ample time to accomplish something before the deadline. From the existential perspective, the mere presence of a free choice validates a person's existence, signifying that the quality of the choice is not as crucial as whether it is favorable or unfavorable. Conversely, the concept of hedonism prioritizes the individual's pleasure over everything else; the effort to evade punishment and the potential gain, along with the satisfaction of resolving the predicament, may justify deception.
Ethical Concerns of Employing Drones
In the 2010s, the US government implemented a drone program; spanning several years, five hundred and sixty-three drone attacks were executed in Pakistan, Somalia, and Yemen, resulting in the deaths of over 800 civilians. Naturally, inquiries regarding the ethics of utilizing such weaponry promptly surfaced in society. The moral issue, not contingent on legality, revolves around whether it is morally commendable or objectionable to employ drones. The primary moral quandary concerning drones is the equivocal impact of this technology on the pilots’ well-being.
The government's perspective posits that remote weaponized drones are a commendable solution for reducing physical costs in the military. Indeed, drone pilots are not physically present on the battlefield. Nonetheless, although the pilots are distanced from the drone, they wield significant influence from the ethical aspect of the matter. Furthermore, risks to human life and health transcend physical harm. Numerous instances of psychological stress among operational participants have been documented, and the detriment of moral wounds adversely affects health akin to physical injuries. Some may contend that the psychological strain on the drone pilot is overstated, but technology progresses swiftly. The rapid advancement of technology at large necessitates a reconsideration of numerous ethical predicaments (Quinn, 2020). As this technology advances, RPA pilots will perceive the target not merely as pixels but as a person; hence, heightened psychological ramifications are unavoidable.
Another ethical predicament linked to drone deployment pertains to the challenge of deciding to commence a war on the state's part. The feasibility of remote warfare renders the decision to initiate a war overly facile. Hence, any decision to instigate a conflict under such circumstances might be unjust. Another ethical complexity is the extent to which the objectives of such a war warrant the means: civilian casualties and jeopardy to the pilot. Naturally, casualties among the populace are inevitable in any war scenario; despite drone technology minimizing casualties, it is not eradicated. Envisioning a war entirely detached from all fronts remains implausible. Even if the drone pilot is shielded, the personnel supporting the operation on the ground are in grave peril. Therefore, the presumption that long-range combat capabilities culminate in risk-free wars is empirically untenable.
The Limitations of the Utilitarianism Ethical Theory
The conventional definition of utilitarianism stipulates that actions are deemed 'right' or 'correct' based on their capacity to foster happiness. If an action yields adverse consequences, it may be labeled 'wrong.' Such a perspective presupposes that the end justifies the means to achieve a specific outcome. Utilitarianism posits that if an action engenders more happiness than any other accessible alternative, that selection is deemed the correct one. From a utilitarian vantage point, actions are considered appropriate only if the decision's outcome maximizes what is deemed beneficial as opposed to what can be perceived as detrimental. Consequently, utilitarianism emanates from the assumption that happiness is invariably beneficial for an individual. The concept of utilitarianism manifests several drawbacks: disregarding the unpredictability of future outcomes, the subjectivity of the happiness concept, the aspects of experiencing happiness, and the potential for the absolute predominance of the majority.
One of the primary drawbacks of utilitarianism is its emphasis on the consequence of a choice rather than the action itself. There is no ethical evaluation concerning the actions an individual opts to take. Consequences only materialize if the outcome fails to maximize happiness in some manner. If an individual's actions yield maximal happiness, external opinions questioning the propriety of the actions become irrelevant. Utilitarianism advocates that individuals project into the future and forecast what will deliver the utmost happiness at present. Furthermore, happiness is a wholly subjective notion: what provides joy to one individual may be distressing to another. Additionally, precisely gauging or quantifying the quantum of happiness derived from an entity is unfeasible. Such a nebulous criterion for evaluating the moral facets of actions is unsustainable.
Every pursuit that an individual endeavors will invariably be captivating if the initial encounter is positive. Subsequent repetitions of the activity might diminish the happiness attained, which is customary. From this theory's standpoint, it appears that an individual should discontinue the activity if it ceases to induce happiness, which seems somewhat inadequate. Furthermore, utilitarianism would grant absolute authority to the majority across all facets of public life. For instance, if the majority deems pedophilia acceptable and normal, that would legitimize any legislation or regulations permitting such behavior, even if such a choice were glaringly immoral.

Ahmed's deed can almost unequivocally be regarded in a negative light. Primarily, it is nearly illicit from the standpoint of
