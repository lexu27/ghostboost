Most authors depend on the pivotal moments in their narratives to fully flesh out specific characters. The audience obtains a clear image of the authentic essence of the characters by recounting their interactions with others, conversations, and behaviors. The writers utilize this approach to animate their characters in their narratives. Mr. Kapasi, the chauffeur who also acts as a guide for the Das family, is disclosed more through his connections with Mrs. Das than any other individuals in Jhumpa Lahiri’s brief novel "Interpreter of Maladies."
In his late forties, Mr. Kapasi, a brilliant Indian gentleman who has forsaken sentimental values in his marriage, is the leading figure in this concise tale narrated with restricted omniscience. Mr. Kapasi is precise in his physical traits and possesses numerous characteristics like observance, diligence, humility, reliability, and intellect. He is well-educated, holds two occupations that require him to utilize his linguistic abilities, and navigates through life devoid of his wife’s affection. He promptly identifies the similarities and differences between travelers and himself. Consequently, the paper examines how Lahiri depicts Mr. Kapasi through his connections with Mrs. Das and the indirect representation of Mrs. Das in the narrative.
It is uncovered how Mr. Kapasi perceives himself and his romantic life through their association and communication. For instance, he views his matrimony as unsuccessful and desires a more romantic existence. To take action, he constructs a fantasy in which he envisions himself in an intimate bond with Mrs. Das, whom he believes is grappling with similar issues. His spouse has distanced herself from him and disapproves of his secondary profession as a medical interpreter, evident in their exchanges. She appeared preoccupied with their son’s demise, which transpired at the medical facility where Mr. Kapasi serves as an interpreter. Mrs. Das shares comparable sentiments with the protagonist. She, too, is trapped in an affectionless relationship. Initially, Mr. Kapasi fantasizes about potential resemblances between himself and Mrs. Das, but his disappointment grows as he learns more about Mrs. Das’s character.
He selects intimacy with her as a gesture of appreciation for Mrs. Das’s kindred nature in describing his job as 'romantic,' believing it is the sole suitable method to alleviate his solitude. Although his stance does not alter when he realizes that the woman does not match the one he envisioned in his fantasy, this interaction showcases his grateful and compassionate persona. This occurs after she discloses her extramarital affair with her husband’s friend, from which a child resulted. “Is it agony you’re feeling, Mrs. Das, or is it guilt?” he ponders upon hearing her account of infidelity (Lahiri 120). This query conveys his sympathy for Mr. Das when he discovers the sinister nature of the woman he once perceived as virtuous.
Mr. Kapasi comprehends that he has amplified the magnitude of his issues with his spouse after hearing Mrs. Das’s confession. He realizes that significantly graver circumstances could have caused him to perceive his situation even more negatively than he currently does. Mr. Kapasi seems to lack genuine insight into understanding individuals, notwithstanding his ability to elucidate various health and related matters for numerous people, as evidenced by his wife’s misconstrued perception of the woman he once idolized. Mr. Kapasi’s persona would have remained undisclosed without Mrs. Das in the short story "Interpreter of Maladies." The other characters he encounters and engages with display no concern for his well-being. They treat him as if he were a subordinate person, akin to their treatment of each other. Mr. Das, for instance, displays indifference towards Mr. Kapasi due to their unfamiliarity. Hence, it is plausible to infer that Mrs. Das's character is pivotal as she aids in unveiling and showcasing Mr. Kapasi’s genuine nature, which would have otherwise remained underdeveloped in her absence.
Mrs. Das serves as a catalyst for narrative progression and a platform for societal commentary in Jhumpa Lahiri’s exquisitely crafted novel "The Interpreter of Maladies." Mrs. Das presents a direct cultural juxtaposition to Mr. Kapasi through her indirect portrayal, driving the plot forward while offering poignant social critique. The Das family encounters Mr. Kapasi as they prepare for their expedition through India. It strikes Mr. Kapasi as odd that “Mr. Das should refer to his wife by her first name when addressing the young girl” (Lahiri 30). The cultural disparity between Kapasi and the Das family becomes immediately apparent. When “Mr. and Mrs. Das behaved like an elder brother and sister, not parents, the cultural divide becomes evident” (Lahiri 56). Such stark differences, as in the case between Mrs. Das and Mr. Kapasi, often spark curiosity among individuals.
Mrs. Das embodies an unfamiliar territory to Mr. Kapasi. Mr. Kapasi’s admiration for Mrs. Das intensifies as the story progresses, with him finding himself gazing at her, admiring her legs, and desiring her companionship. The cultural distinction between Mrs. Das and Mr. Kapasi sets this affair apart from others, adding to its allure (thus propelling the narrative forward). On one side, Mr. Kapasi is an impoverished, unfortunate Indian who works as an interpreter and guide. On the other side, Mrs. Das seems to live luxuriously. She is disconnected from reality: her discontent stems from leading a life characterized by irresponsibility, superficiality, shallowness, and an unsettling sense of tranquility.
Mrs. Das also epitomizes conventional American traits like egocentrism, ethnocentrism, negligence, and apathy towards the external world. This is revealed through her portrayal as she neglects to hold the young girl’s hand as they head to the restroom,” providing a first impression of Mrs. Das. Mr. Kapasi has a solid foundation for perceiving the family as siblings, as Mrs. Das displays a lack of concern for her children’s safety. “He couldn’t fathom Mr. and Mrs. Das being in charge of anything else” (Lahiri 160). Mrs. Das’s self-absorbed demeanor signifies her disinterest in Mr. Kapasi, her family, and the journey; hence, Mrs. Das’s enthusiasm for Mr. Kapasi’s role as a language interpreter comes as a surprise. Mrs. Das lauds Mr. Kapasi by deeming his occupation as “very romantic” while he briefly describes the job he deems insignificant (Lahiri 161). Mrs. Das’s comments impact Mr. Kapasi, who possesses a misinterpreting mindset, causing his thoughts to magnify the statement.
In conclusion, through the intricacies of the characters’ traits, the writer enables readers to grasp the characters. Additionally, the author illustrates how the characters perceive specific subjects based on their reactions to various incidents. The theme of love and marriage is mirrored in the character portrayal throughout the narrative. Their traits, such as Mrs. Das's self-centeredness and Mr. Kapasi’s evolution into a compassionate figure, are well elaborated. Through these characters, marriage emerges as a significant issue to contemplate. Their characterization also contributes to the narrative’s progression concerning societal matters that impact us.
