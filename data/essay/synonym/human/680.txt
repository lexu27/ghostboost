Technological progression has led to business shifting online, which, in turn, necessitates effective market positioning online through media. Naturally, traditional sources people are accustomed to are now surpassed by the numerous advantages of new media. To be more precise, legacy media targets a wide audience, which is, evidently, inefficient and results in companies squandering their money on a few integrations. This kind of promotion focuses on outdated news presentations, like posters, television ads, or printed materials (Vara-Miguel, 2020). Consequently, the audience exposed to the advertisements is not segmented properly, indicating that most viewers do not find the ads engaging and do not purchase the showcased products.

Conversely, new media is tailored to the contemporary perspective of society that is consistently involved in interaction with various technological gadgets. Moreover, Generation Z is more inclined to be encouraged to buy the promoted goods when encountering the ads on social media (Vara-Miguel, 2020). This is why new media is predominantly positioned on popular social platforms, such as YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, and notably Tik Tok (Vara-Miguel, 2020). The influencers collaborate with many companies, promoting their products or service online to their followers, which is evidently more effective than the traditional techniques of legacy media. In general, individuals are more inclined to purchase the items that are endorsed by their preferred bloggers, models, actors, and other celebrities or accomplished social-media influencers.
