Preamble
Synchronization in healthcare is a pivotal endeavor endorsing healthcare's effective and thriving transmission. Healthcare rules, moral asset evolution, and many other indispensable facets of healthcare should be contemplated while organizing therapy for patients. Care coordination also deliberates a patient's psychological necessities, cultural standpoint, morals, and other specific attributes that offer gratification throughout the therapy process. A chosen patient's high blood pressure will be inspected, and a provisional care coordination scheme prepared to deal with the patient's necessities. High blood pressure is a state in which blood pressure is higher than it should be. Approximately 50% of the US populace from about 54 to 74 years has high blood pressure (Carey & Whelton, 2018). Therefore, a synchronized care plan will aid the patient and anyone else who might be impacted by the condition. The number of occurrences of high blood pressure has escalated, and the primary cause is individuals' lifestyles.

Patient-Focused Health Interventions
Efficient interventions should situate the patient at the core of the treatment and clinical endeavors. Patient-focused care incorporates involving the patient in the treatment process and taking an active role. Patients can make a notable difference in the caliber of healthcare they receive if they are sufficiently engaged (Fowler, 2017). The patient in this study was a 65-year-old woman diagnosed with high blood pressure in July 2019. The crucial statistics are BP 141/90, HR 108 bpm, temperature 38 Â°C, and RR 37 bpm. Upon learning about her illness, the patient became keen on care coordination and enhanced the plan promptly. She expressed eagerness to discover more about the ailment and what she could do to sustain a regular life despite having a disability. Her high blood pressure could induce numerous health issues; hence, it was essential to point out three of them.

Cardiac Arrest or Heart Attack
A heart attack can transpire due to the hardening and thickening of the arteries prompted by high blood pressure (atherosclerosis). It is general knowledge that a heart attack occurs when there is an obstruction of blood flow to the heart, culminating in a blood clot formation. A stroke is a comparable impediment of blood flow but affects the brain (Wang et al., 2018). Nevertheless, they follow a similar sequence, and patients with high blood pressure should be vigilant for any of these health issues since they are more prone to occur.

The best means to avert cardiac problems for the patient in question encompass quitting smoking and alcohol consumption, engaging in adequate physical activity, regulating their blood sugar and cholesterol levels, and shedding or managing their current weight. With the backing of a medical coordination collaboration team, the patient can accomplish this. Another approach to enhance this is to include a shared resource to supply the patient with more information concerning their treatment alternatives (Wang et al., 2018). Health Partners Regional Hospital, Mayo Clinic, and University of Minnesota Medical Center are exceptional community resources.

Melancholy
Acquiring knowledge about high blood pressure might significantly impact a patient's mental and emotional well-being. Since this is a prolonged ailment, the patient will need to modify her lifestyle and allocate a considerable amount of money to ensure that she attains the best possible treatment (Fowler, 2017). All of these factors may take a toll on the patient. Depression is a severe issue because its symptoms and signs might be misinterpreted for those of other medical conditions.

In the management of depression, patient-focused interventions encompass ensuring that the patient upholds her daily activities, utilizes medication when symptoms manifest, educates the patient about depression, and involves the patient's social circle more in her comprehensive health and well-being (Wang et al., 2018). The University of Minnesota Medical Center, Mayo Clinic, psychiatric hospitals, the Minnesota Department of Human Services, and other community services could be consulted if a patient grapples with depression.

Cognitive Impairment
Blocked arteries induce vascular dementia, and constricted arteries obstruct blood flow to the brain. Strokes are deemed to be a contributing factor in individuals developing dementia. Cognitive regression is one of the key features of dementia (decline in memory, problem-solving skills, and language) (Fowler, 2017). Patients with high blood pressure should recognize that poor health and lifestyle decisions can lead to dementia, a persistent and advancing ailment.

Physical exercises, multisensory stimulation, and medication are all instances of patient-focused treatments (pharmacology). Recollection, reassurance, and aromatherapy are some of the techniques employed to manage those with dementia (Wang et al., 2018). The Minnesota Guardians Pharmacy, the University of Minnesota Medical Center, and the Mayo Clinic are among the local community services that can assist patients in coping with dementia.

Moral deliberations in patient-focused healthcare interventions
Healthcare has a critical role in upholding ethical standards and should be executed following moral principles. According to the Institute of Medicine (IOM), patient-focused treatment incorporates moral considerations as a fundamental component (Fowler, 2017). This encompasses ensuring that patients are treated with respect and thoughtfulness at all times. American Nurses Association's (ANA) Code of Ethics encourages nurses to ensure that they adhere to their professional standards. The ethical principles of healthcare delivery, such as kindness, autonomy, nonmaleficence, and fairness, are pivotal benchmarks for ensuring that treatment is administered ethically. Enhancing care coordination is facilitated by ethical and moral healthcare practices.

Regarding caring coordination, ethical queries emerge and are crucial, such as whether the patient's welfare has been accounted for. Furthermore, whether care coordination has boosted patient safety and healthcare quality is another concern (Wang et al., 2018). Team members might contemplate what they would have achieved if the issue had been more personal (perhaps to a family member or friend). Quality care and patient outcomes can be ensured if issues are managed ethically, and the patient receives the finest treatment accessible.

Continuity and Synchronization of Care in Health Policy
Health policies play a pivotal role in ensuring that healthcare is ethical and compliant with applicable laws. Health policy should also contemplate moral considerations, a critical element of the care integration tactic. The government and the organizations established to oversee and operationalize healthcare operations formulate health policies. They are designed to ensure that healthcare objectives are attained swiftly and effectively (Wang et al., 2018). The Affordable Care Act (ACA), commonly referred to as Obamacare following President Barack Obama's advocacy for its enactment, is a notable healthcare policy. Irrespective of how it is perceived, the law has had a substantial impact on the process of care coordination and continuity.

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) is a regulation that regulates patient information confidentiality and insurance coverage for healthcare services under its jurisdiction. It aims to enhance healthcare accessibility to a broader population, regardless of their residency in the country or the federal government's jurisdiction over them at any given time. A multidisciplinary approach, trust, and privacy in care coordination facilitate patients in divulging their private medical information to a wide array of specialists (Hu et al., 2018). HIPAA ensures that care coordination utilizes patient data in the most efficient manner possible.

Both Obamacare and HIPAA assure patient assistance in times of need. High blood pressure may significantly impact patients, and they should receive the best available care (Hu et al., 2018). Additionally, the
