Social networking platforms have intricate algorithms that suggest information or promotions based on the usersâ€™ preferences. For example, the operation of those algorithms can be readily observed on TikTok by viewing an engaging video. The application can classify the subjects and recommend similar videos to retain the user's focus. To validate this hypothesis, I commenced viewing numerous videos about ice-skating. As a result, every third video on TikTok was associated with this specific subject. When I scroll through ice-skating videos without viewing them, they start to appear infrequently in my TikTok feed. The same algorithm functions when I begin to skip captivating videos and watch something different. It becomes challenging to retrieve videos that I enjoy as the algorithm monitors all my activities.
Instagram and YouTube employ the same algorithmic system, and the suggested promotions are typically grounded on previous Google searches. For instance, lately, I have been searching for a new pair of shoes, and a vast number of ads began to be displayed while watching videos on YouTube or viewing stories on Instagram. Furthermore, some algorithms possess the capacity to recall audio, and during conversations, the systems capture various product names, leading to promotions appearing in the social media sphere. On one side, this technology could be beneficial as individuals can access varied information in line with their preferences. Additionally, advertisements may not be intrusive and occasionally recommend necessary products. Nevertheless, given that phones and other devices might pick up on conversations and transmit this data to the artificial intelligence that designs algorithms, it could be unsettling for some individuals, potentially diminishing the level of trust.
