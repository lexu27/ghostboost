Preamble
I opted for the Gardens by the Bay due to their distinctive layout and Singapore's ingenuity in creating a city surrounded by a garden. The constructions also suggest a potential future that involves merging nature and urbanization, demonstrating the opportunity for future generations to live alongside vegetation (PMP, 2022). Its exquisite design and sophisticated structures also possess an aesthetic attraction that inspired me to delve into their designer and the motivation behind their creation. Before enrolling in this course, I had some awareness of the Gardens by the Bay; however, my knowledge was limited to their whereabouts and the recognition they have garnered over time.
Architect and their Incentive to Execute the Task
The Gardens by the Bay were planned by two collaborating firms, the Wilkinson Eyre Architects and Grant Associates. When the Supertrees are illuminated at night, they resemble cocktail glasses. The main design supervisor of the structures, Andrew Grant, mentioned that he derived inspiration for this shape after visiting his brother in Australia and exploring the Valley of the Giants. He observed elevated pathways that traverse a canopy of tingle and karri trees (PMP, 2022). Additionally, it is crucial to acknowledge the impact of Singapore's national flower, the orchid. This comprehensive strategy highlights the beauty of these flowers through the exotic gardens while embodying their anatomy through the structures' unique infrastructure for managing water, energy, and waste. It is also vital to consider Singapore's drive for this attraction as it involved intentions to establish a 'city in a garden,' enhancing the quality of life through intricate flora and greenery within the city.
Shape and Purpose
It serves as Singapore's primary garden and a premier botanical attraction for its residents and global visitors. The gardens are a masterpiece of garden and horticultural creativity, presenting a fresh perspective on the plant realm. They blend nature and urban existence, interwoven in a mutually advantageous manner (Gardens by the Bay, 2022). Furthermore, the Gardens by the Bay was developed as a form of recreation while enlightening visitors about plants that many individuals in the Asian region seldom encounter. It amalgamates plant species from cold regions, temperate zones, tropical habitats, and forests. The Gardens by the Bay stands as the most extensive garden globally with supertrees.
Personal Response to this Creation
The Gardens by the Bay stands out as one of the most unique and eco-friendly structures globally. The supertrees simulate ecological functions, utilizing technology to imitate similar characteristics to plant photosynthesis (Gardens by the Bay, 2022). The edifices collect rainwater, further underscoring Singapore's remarkable dedication to environmental preservation. Their decision to cultivate exotic plants in an education-focused attraction is also a commendable achievement. While the nation reaps economic benefits from these structures, it aids in safeguarding certain plant species and igniting curiosity in younger generations about the charm of diversity. The exotic plants offer individuals in the vicinity a glimpse of the natural greenery and horticulture elsewhere; few places can pride themselves on attempting such a venture.
Influence on the Perspective of the Work based on Architectural Knowledge and Utilization of Structures
The utilization of the structures in Singapore significantly influences my perception of the Gardens by the Bay. Furthermore, I do not believe the architect has impacted my view of the works. Nonetheless, it is essential to mention that Grant's architectural design had a noble inspiration as it concentrated on blending nature and urban structures (BBC Travel, 2022). It strives to leverage natural energy, water, and waste management practices to support a contemporary lifestyle. My positive outlook is predominantly rooted in the eco-friendly nature of the buildings, demonstrating individuals' ability to construct solid structures while emulating organic materials to safeguard the planet and promote environmental awareness.
Formal Aspects of Architectural Design
Equilibrium
The Gardens by the Bay are harmonized as the supertrees incorporate vertical circular columns. Moreover, the Bay Gardens are also balanced despite the absence of column support, as seen in certain dome-shaped structures (Vinnitskaya, 2011).
Difference
The structures do not display any form of difference. For instance, the supertrees are modeled after an orchid flower, while the Bay Gardens are inspired by a leaf. However, the sleeping baby diverges from this uniformity as a white 7-ton structure (Vinnitskaya, 2011).
Design and Recurrence
The work showcases similar designs in its external and internal structures. Supertrees range from 25m to 50m and feature a conical shape, adopting a resemblance to cocktail glasses. There are 18 structures linked by pathways showcasing this design.
Beat
It is crucial to highlight the rhythmic patterns demonstrated by the supertrees as they share a common form. They also illuminate at night, casting a captivating glow over the garden. Their connection exudes the allure of a forest with luminous flowers (Vinnitskaya, 2011).
Symmetry and Asymmetry
The Bay Gardens are asymmetrical, while the supertrees are symmetrical. However, the latter exhibit varying sizes to replicate the essence of a forest, comprising tall and shorter structures.
Proportion and Size
The structures boast lofty ceilings, with one of the Bay Gardens housing the second tallest indoor waterfall globally. The expansive rooms aim to mirror the vast expanse of open space rather than a confined area.
