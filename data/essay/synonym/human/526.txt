Epigenetics denotes the exploration of how an individual's behavior and surroundings can impact the functioning of the genes. Unlike alterations occurring directly in the genes, epigenetic modifications can be reversed and do not influence the DNA sequence; nevertheless, they can alter how the body interprets the DNA sequence. For instance, upon encountering two identical twins, their physical characteristics exhibit variances, despite their initial resemblance. As the twins grow older, the influence of environmental and behavioral elements becomes more noticeable, contributing to the alterations and distinctions between them. Therefore, epigenetics could serve as a crucial framework for comprehending an individual's inclination to develop a specific health condition.
Regarding the considerations of epigenetics concerning a disease for which an individual has a high susceptibility, it is crucial to contemplate family history along with environmental factors that contribute to the onset of the unfavorable health condition. Assessing all aspects, the disease most likely to manifest in the future is type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes denotes a dysfunction in how the body regulates and utilizes sugar as energy (Rosen et al., 2018). It is a lasting ailment that can be controlled with medication and lifestyle adjustments but cannot be entirely eradicated with no residual signs of the condition. This deduction was drawn based on various factors relating to family history and environmental and behavioral aspects.
Particularly, both the progenitor and the sibling had type 2 diabetes, diagnosed during adulthood. In adulthood, type 2 diabetes is prone to develop due to behavioral and environmental factors, such as heightened blood pressure, elevated levels of lipids in the blood, a sedentary way of life, excessive alcohol consumption, obesity and overweight, among others (Rosen et al., 2018). Hence, since there are direct genetic links between a parent and a sibling, both of whom acquired diabetes in adulthood, it is crucial to regard such information as highly pertinent. Other potential diseases encompassed breast cancer, glaucoma, and thyroid dysfunction, which were detected in other relatives, for which the risk factors are lower.
Epigenetics proposes that even in cases of genetic risk factors, there exists a chance to either elevate or diminish the likelihood of developing a disease with the aid of environmental and behavioral enhancements. Moreover, researchers have been concentrating on a novel research schedule, accentuating the connections between health and environmental and societal factors. Consequently, societal determinants of health constitute a substantial component of epigenetics as it endeavors to elucidate any non-medical factors that directly impact health, like principles, attitudes, knowledge, and conducts (Notterman & Mitchell, 2016). Moreover, across an individual's lifespan, health can be significantly influenced by societal disadvantages.
The exploration of epigenetics has addressed the regulation of both disease and homeostasis. Considering that the risk of diabetes and its complications is linked with environmental and hereditary factors, it is unsurprising that research in this domain is extensive (Rosen et al., 2018). Additionally, Rosen et al. (2018) articulated that there are several domains of epigenetic control, such as direct methylation of adenine or cytosine residues, covalent alterations to histone proteins, higher-level chromatin organization, and non-coding RNA. These domains have been implicated in cellular processes pertinent to diabetes, with a prolonged history of associations between diabetes and epigenetics, as well as other challenges related to metabolism like obesity, overweight, and other metabolic disorders.
It is noteworthy that the risk of diabetes onset in an individual has been tied to escalated rates of micro- and macrovascular complications. Clinical experiments conducted among individuals with diabetes have underscored the favorable impacts of intensive glycemic management to avert the emergence and advancement of complications. Specifically, the incidence of complications linked with diabetes can be influenced by glucose levels experienced years earlier, denoted as metabolic remembrance (Rosen et al., 2018). Metabolic changes can provide a biological rationale for the enduring effect of metabolic alterations, as metabolite levels can affect the epigenome while maintaining such changes during cell division.
Essentially, studies concentrating on cells and tissues from patients diagnosed with diabetes have showcased remarkable distinctions in epigenetic imprints at fundamental genes associated with complications, encompassing fibrotic and inflammatory genes. For instance, the authors allude to the article by Beckerman, Ko, and Susztak (2014), who utilized kidney tissues from patients diagnosed with diabetes and chronic kidney disease to demonstrate epigenetic alterations in genes related to renal disease. Furthermore, epigenetic mechanisms have been demonstrated to influence cellular models of metabolic remembrance.
Thus, the epigenetics exposition indicated that diabetes and its related complications could jointly impact the variations in DNA sequence, with environmental influences affecting transitions in the cellular phenotype. As epigenetics as a discipline advances swiftly, there exists a potential to expedite the exploration of the cell-type-focused epigenome atlas. Such charts can aid in interpreting genetic discrepancies and highlighting the avenues through which such discrepancies lead to disease progression. Moreover, epigenome charts incorporating considerations of genomic and genetic data can enrich the comprehension of mechanisms in which environmental alterations contribute to diabetes development.
Upon completing the Living to 100 Questionnaire, it was ascertained that the life expectancy was 83, which stands as a commendable score. Nonetheless, it is essential to assess the impact of epigenetics as an indication that environmental factors and genetics could diminish life quality. The family history intimates that diabetes could be a potential contributing factor. Specifically, the collective diabetic life expectancy is 74.64 years (Tachkov et al., 2020). This underscores the necessity to adopt positive lifestyle changes and adhere to a healthy regimen to extend life expectancy and avert diabetes onset, considering the heightened risk identified in the family history challenges.
To enhance health and longevity in light of the questionnaire findings and the highlighted epigenetics implications, it is crucial initially to partake in regular health evaluations to enable timely intervention in a prediabetic state while preventive measures are instituted. Furthermore, contemplating the contributors to diabetes, it is vital to stay physically active, maintain a wholesome diet in line with healthcare providers' general recommendations, monitor weight gain, and abstain from detrimental practices like smoking or excessive drinking. Routine check-ups and timely treatment schemes are also imperative to contemplate since they can be beneficial in forestalling the emergence of adverse health conditions in their nascent stages.
