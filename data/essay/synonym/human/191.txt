Prolonged pain is still regarded as a severe concern among at least 8% of the inhabitants of advanced countries. The inception of the study delineates the apparent association between pain and demoralization. Prolonged pain is always coupled with adverse emotional encounters and impedes a person's capacity to derive pleasure and contentment from life. The exploration delves into the progression of depression and anxiety among patients receiving pharmaceutical opioids and medical marijuana (MM) as potent pain relievers. It juxtaposes the effectiveness of prescriptions and scrutinizes the likelihood of post-treatment depression.
There is presently a critical scarcity of information regarding the impacts of opiates. They effectively handle pain, but the recent decades have indicated the escalating apprehension concerning opiate misuse in the form of overdose and addiction. A more controllable and safer alternative might be medical marijuana. Nonetheless, the legal status and novelty of this substance do not permit the discovery of a large number of studies on its efficacy. Specifically, this pertains to the emotional state of patients enduring prolonged pain. This study aims to scrutinize levels of depression and anxiety among individuals undergoing therapy by contrasting the impacts of pharmaceutical opioids and MM.
The study was carried out in the form of compilation and analysis of statistical data. Participants were enlisted for six months at two prominent pain relief centers in Israel. The researchers employed The Depression Module of the Patient Health Questionnaire and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale to interview participants, assess their responses, and conduct the study. To precisely evaluate and compare the probabilities of depression or anxiety among the various groups, the study utilized multiple logistic regression analysis and designated medical marijuana as the control group.
This form of study is the most enlightening and comprehensive as it encompasses direct feedback from a substantial number of participants. All tools in the guise of questionnaires and scales have already been utilized and demonstrated their efficacy in amassing analytical data. It aids in organizing and categorizing distinct types of information for subsequent straightforward services. Consequently, researchers can assess the impacts of medications on patients of diverse age brackets, backgrounds, physical conditions, emotional states, and so forth.
The evaluation of any human response carries a high potential for subjectivity and bias, particularly concerning individuals in severe pain and an unstable emotional state. Maybe certain patients have a tendency to overstate their despondent condition or conversely, downplay serious challenges. Because the survey responses were completely anonymous, the researchers were incapable of thoroughly scrutinizing each patient's reaction and contrasting it with the actual conditions. More precise responses could be procured by professional psychologists through personal interaction and behavioral scrutiny. Nevertheless, this research approach is significantly more resource-intensive and demanding in terms of energy.
Participants were enlisted for six months at two major pain relief centers in Israel. All patients endured persistent pain for a minimum of 3 months. The study encompassed 890 participants, of which 474 (59%) were treated exclusively with opioids, 329 (41%) were treated with MM, and 77 (8.6%) obtained both (Feingold et al., 2017). The remaining ten participants who did not receive pharmaceutical opioids and medical marijuana were excluded from the research analysis. Hence, it is not feasible to comprehensively compare patients taking medications with those who are not.
The study conducted a correlation type of research with variable measures. It appraised the interrelation of diverse factors that influenced the physical and emotional state of patients enduring persistent pain. For instance, the survey revealed that the proportion of female patients was notably higher in the opiates group compared to the MM group. Conversely, individuals on opiates were more prone to report significant depressive disorders.
The questionnaires employed varied variable measures to gather information. For instance, it encompassed exhaustive socio-demographic data: gender, age, country, type of habitation (urban/rural), years of education, and employment status. Patients were also interrogated about their medical history over the years and the current existence of any grave ailments such as heart failure, diabetes, arthritis, and so on. The third measure of the questionnaire was denoted by details on any twelve-month and lifetime substance and alcohol consumption. Additionally, the record included a pain measurement scale from 0 to 10 to gauge discomfort sensations during the preceding month.
Among all participants in the study, 42.2% endured depression, and 37% encountered excessive anxiety. The majority of depressive disorders among patients in the opiates, medical marijuana, and mixed OPMM groups totaled 57.1%, 22.3%, and 51.4%, respectively. The majority of anxiety comprised 48.4% among OP patients, 21.5% among MM patients, and 38.7% among OPMM participants. Patients who ingested potent opiates tended to rank their pain between 9 and 10 on a scale (Feingold et al., 2017). They were also emotionally distressed and responded extremely negatively to nearly all survey queries. Patients who solely took MM or a combined medication regimen exhibited a notably more stable emotional state and coped with pain more effectively.
One of the key constraints is the inadequately high response rate, 57% as opposed to 70% (Feingold et al., 2017). This can be reasonably clarified by the feeble focus of respondents who have surmounted severe pain sensations and depressive episodes. How to utilize these statistics is not evident, as they may still be pertinent for the overall analysis.
