History and Consequence of Employing Women and Minorities in Law Enforcement
Law enforcement illustrates how laws are enforced and public order is upheld. Caucasian males have been disproportionately occupying positions in this field for an extended period. Presently, the scenario has changed, and more females and minority groups are encouraged to partake in law enforcement careers to diminish the impact of bureaucracy and other prejudices. The initial females and African Americans were recruited as police officers in the midst of the 19th century. In the midst of the 20th century, the Civil Rights Act eradicated other discrimination-based discussions and advocated for equality in public accommodations. Ethnical diversification of law enforcement agencies is preferred to boost trust in the police and enhance police-minority relationships (Sever et al., 2018). Females in law enforcement also advocate for a reduction in the use of physical force and misunderstandings in communities (Sever et al., 2018). Even though males dominate in law enforcement occupation, alterations and regard must not be disregarded in the present time.
Different Roles of Law Enforcement
Law enforcement is a crucial function of the government to enforce regulations and manage communities' behaviors and interactions. The primary functions of this profession are to uphold public order and oversee public safety. It is crucial to observe how individuals suspected of criminal acts are handled and how inquiries are arranged. The judiciary seeks to ensure that alleged offenders receive just trials and that their culpability or innocence is accurately determined. The correctional system, conversely, concentrates on modifying behaviors to render individuals socially acceptable and compliant with the law. When an offender is apprehended by the police (a law enforcement agent), it is essential to ensure that no unjustified force is exerted. The judiciary scrutinizes every aspect and ensures that all entitlements are respected and no errors occur. Corrections aid individuals in transforming their behaviors and comprehending what actions are permissible and impermissible within the boundaries of the established system and society.
