The subsequent manufacturing upheaval, often known as the technological upheaval, signifies a phase of increased industrialization, mass manufacturing, standardization, and scientific exploration. The conclusion of the primary manufacturing upheaval led to a decrease in critical creations. Nevertheless, the beginning of the subsequent upheaval triggered various manufacturing advancements, such as steel manufacturing, the creation of exchangeable components, and advancements in the machine tool sector. Numerous historians pinpoint the commencement of the second manufacturing upheaval from 1870 to the outbreak of the First World War in 1914.
The second manufacturing upheaval played a pivotal part in urbanization. Initially, up to 80% of the population inhabited rural regions and relied on animal husbandry and agriculture (Huberman et al., 2017). The remarkable expansion of telegraph and rail networks, gas, sewage systems, and water provision resulted in a population surge in concentrated areas, leading to urbanization. The simultaneous introduction of innovative technological systems like electrification prompted substantial migrations to industrialized locales. For example, roughly 10% of Britons lived in London by the conclusion of the 19th Century, while areas like Manchester also encountered substantial population inflows.
The increase in urbanization brought about the exploitation of the laboring class. As industrialization gained momentum, there were no regulations governing laborer circumstances, and authority was concentrated in a few affluent individuals while the factory working class endured. Numerous slums emerged in urban regions, and child labor became widespread. During the population increase in urban areas, infectious diseases became more widespread. Thousands perished from illnesses like cholera and tuberculosis in hubs like London (Kennedy, 2020). Simultaneously, the manufacturing upheaval resulted in an unparalleled surge in consumerism and materialism, particularly with the technological breakthroughs that generated new products and amenities for the public.
The most conspicuous repercussions of the manufacturing upheaval and urbanization were contamination and environmental degradation. Fresh apparatus required substantial energy to operate, leading to extensive combustion of fossil fuels causing air contamination and smog (Eisen, 2018). The discharge of manufacturing waste and untreated human waste into waterways and the clearing of forests to accommodate settlers resulted in rampant environmental harm. The era also marked the creation of substances such as polymers, pigments, and medications, which impacted human and environmental well-being.
