Mark Hendrickson’s piece entitled “Advance agent of expanding empires: George F. Becker and mineral exploration in South Africa and the Philippines” delves into the geologist’s role in molding the American perception of imperial growth. The initial few sections of the article recount the era during which the British Empire suffered due to its erroneous colonial strategies, notably in South Africa, where the British faced continual clashes with the indigenous Boer administration. Bearing this in mind, the writer adeptly draws the readers’ focus to George Becker’s character, who acquired expertise in the South African region abundant with gold mines and political unrest (Hendrickson 2019). He also operated in the Philippines, which had recently been seized following Admiral Dewey’s triumph over the Spanish.
I posit that the primary contention posited by the writer is that given the global empire metamorphosis of the United States, the nation required individuals like Becker. These are individuals who could educate both policymakers and the populace about the inhabitants, their customs, and assets of unfamiliar and distant nations. In this manner, Hendrickson emphasized Becker’s extraordinary role as an educator within the American political upper crust of that era (Hendrickson 2019). For instance, Theodore Roosevelt, the future United States 26 th president, held a strong admiration for Becker due to his comprehensive understanding of the Philippines, encompassing the political landscape of the Asian nation.
I partly concur with this assertion since, indeed, Becker aided in heightening awareness regarding the resources of specific regions and in American geopolitical triumphs. Nevertheless, Becker’s ascent to becoming one of the most influential scientists of his time in scientific and political circles was not immediate. Shortly after his return from South Africa, he delivered a lecture regarding the political state in the region where he sojourned for over a half-year at Columbia University, and this oration propelled him to fame. Subsequently, Becker penned his thoughts on what he perceived as the primary cause of political dilemmas in South Africa (Hendrickson 2019). This was the dearth of political figures capable of governing the nation amidst recent geo-economic revelations, which turned out to be a prescient forecast.
Subsequent to this, Becker was assigned to the Philippines to amass general data about the country’s mineral riches. Later on, the general populace was informed that America’s objective was to introduce civilization to the unenlightened regions. A geological inspection was the initial stride in imparting enlightenment to the Philippines. Nonetheless, Hendrickson (2019) suggests that Becker’s task in the Philippines transcended mere geological curiosity. Instead, he was tasked with establishing a rationale for the American public to condone intervention and aggression against foreign nations.
Thus, although Hendrickson's statement is indeed warranted, Becker’s persona is undeniably contentious and dubious. The geologist actively partook in military maneuvers against Filipinos. He engaged in military brutality against foreign nationals on their turf, yet he also distorted his reports intentionally for the American viewers at the behest of US Senator Beveridge. Furthermore, they labeled insurgents as “earnest though misled patriots,” “adventurers,” and “pursuers of allurements of an exhilarating existence” (Kramer 2018). This fundamentally altered the rationales and motivations of insurgents in the eyes of the American public.
It is crucial to note that Becker’s depiction of gold reserves in South Africa significantly influenced both mining operations and British colonial directives in Africa, rationalizing British hostilities against indigenous populations. Furthermore, he applied the same rationale in the context of American imperial expansions in the Philippines and elsewhere (Hendrickson 2019). Consequently, Becker emerged as one of the key contributors to American expansionist policies and shaped the foreign policies of most western nations concerning nations that are vulnerable but rich in mineral reservoirs.
