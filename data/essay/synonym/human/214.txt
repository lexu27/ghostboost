A plethora of historical occurrences and eras have distinct titles. The rebirth, the illumination, the stone age – all of these were designated as such for a specific rationale, and symbolize a means to distinguish one epoch from another. One prime illustration of that tendency is the industrial revolution. Also known as the industrialization, it was a crucial segment of history and a substantial stride in both technological and social advancement. Occurring at an unprecedented pace, the progression commenced and concluded in under a 100 years. The term “revolution” in “industrial revolution” is utilized to underscore that fact, and indicate that the progression is perceived as both an extreme and rapid advancement in society ( Industrial revolution ). Similar to a genuine revolution, it also had a range of impacts on individuals and their livelihoods. By altering the way work is executed and comprehended, it fundamentally altered the populace’s perception of the economy, labor, and the world itself, propelling both favorable and adverse change. For business owners and individuals commencing their own enterprises, the industrialization emerged as a central focal point and revenue stream, supplanting the manual labor of individuals. It also engendered prospects for novel forms of production and large scale manufacturing to be executed. The introduction of intricate machinery profoundly influenced the laborers as well, displacing the unskilled labor out of vogue and necessitating a higher level of both education and proficiency. Industrial revolution has caused many to lose their jobs, while a multitude of other individuals have acquired new opportunities of employment by relocating into cities (Thompson). Industrialization propelled urban expansion, and contributed to the establishment of the city as a core nucleus for human interaction. On a grander scale, the capacity to mass produce goods and services has enabled nations to establish larger economies, broaden trade, and initiate more comprehensive relationships with their neighbors. All in all, the industrialization era has had its peaks and valleys, but the significance of the process is challenging to disregard, as it remains the cornerstone for the society individuals witness today.
