Synopsis
The ecosystem of writing is highly akin to the humanities in that an individual’s perspective directly impacts everything they undertake. Many individuals differ and assert that each standpoint should be individual and not sway decisions made in a communal environment. To grasp writing, a reader must initially attempt to comprehend the writer’s standpoint because acquainting oneself with the author will aid in interpreting the primary concept of the composition. An individual’s life experience molds their standpoint, and acquainting oneself with the writer and the world around them can aid in comprehending and interpreting writing. Therefore, humanities, the fields that scrutinize societies and cultures, coupled with writing, function as channels for the author’s principles and convictions, which aids in better comprehending the writer’s work and its purported impact.
Prelude
Writing is an essential component of communal life and human existence. Nonetheless, it is not solely a blend of chronicles, traditions, originality, and conceivably, psychology. This domain enables individuals to access the writer’s musings through their words and ruminate on the profound implications and lessons the author wishes the reader to grasp (Steinberg). Furthermore, it can illuminate the author’s thought process and their view of life and the world. Writers’ works, consequently, shape individuals’ perception of the world as they commence applying specific literary illustrations to their daily lives. Thus, writing must be debated from a sociological standpoint.
The premise of human nature is prone to be influenced by society and diverse trends since individuals, being communal beings, incline to mimic the behavioral trends of the majority. Sociological investigations, hence, contend that individuals are inevitably influenced by what they hear and see since emulating this data is a segment of the “social adhesive” or processing of communal data. It is, therefore, rational that writers possess the authority to sway individuals and their perceptions with the aid of the illustrations they craft in their writings. From a scriptural perspective, it can be observed how extensive influence the Bible exerts on cultures, nations, and communities (Green). Such a correlation between the author and readers mirrors the association with the Bible (Dockery). The amalgamation of words, expressions, notions, and illustrations aids in shaping the message, which can strike a chord with billions of people.
Consequently, the authority of words and the narrative behind the work is among the most pivotal tools. It is entirely logical to amalgamate and scrutinize the provided data in the piece of writing through the lens of the writer’s life and experience. This is imperative to contemplate on such data to ascertain how precise illustrations now observed and applied by individuals were formulated.
Biographical Critique
There are numerous methods to scrutinize a work of writing, but all of them are grounded on the principle that the piece of writing is interpreted through either the perspective of the reader or the writer. In the first scenario, an individual analyzes and evaluates the provided data in accordance with their set of beliefs, opinions, or experiences. There might be numerous interpretations of a specific phrase or piece inscribed by the author, contingent on the perspective of a reader. However, in the second instance, the primary notion or message only makes sense if explored in conjunction with the author’s biography.
Biographical critique insinuates that the writing cannot be dissected separately from the authors’ biography or standpoint because the circumstances unfolding in their lives aid in deciphering the significance behind the work. Therefore, delving into the author’s standpoint allows readers to execute a critical analysis of the writing. Among the instances can be the book The prince warrior s inscribed by Priscilla Shirer. Priscilla Shirer is an American author and Christian evangelist. Hence, it is vital to consider this fact while critiquing this author’s works.
The provided work depicts the lives of Xavier and Evan, who, alongside their acquaintances, encounter a mysterious world, Photos. During their sojourn in the realm, the young men combat evil and rescue other warriors with the assistance of a guide (Detwiler). While perusing this book, a reader can identify specific allegories. For instance, the guide that steers the boys in their struggles and unfamiliar milieu can be perceived as a spiritual force or God’s guidance. The path of the young men can be construed as a skirmish of individuals on their route to the spiritual domain.
Another instance is the book The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, inscribed by Lewis. In this piece of work, the author concentrates on the escapade of siblings who come across the wardrobe with a passage to a distinct world (Lewis). The journey of the children is fraught with challenges and encounters with the malevolent, the witch. Nonetheless, with the aid of the lion, the children remain shielded. This book is a splendid portrayal of God’s affection and protection against malevolent forces.
Contrasting Perspectives
Nevertheless, it must be emphasized that examining the author’s past may restrict an individual’s liberty to interpret the import of the writing. While perusing a book, an individual is on their own path of scrutinizing the work autonomously. They can decrypt specific instances and endeavor to grasp the data without the pre-existing facts. In this scenario, readers are at liberty to formulate their understanding as long as they are unacquainted with the background. Once some points are unveiled, the reader forfeits their capability to devise their perception since they cannot segregate already existing significance from their own viewpoint.
Conversely, by disregarding the author’s standpoint or identity, readers forfeit the ability to acquire insights into the illustrations and symbols employed in the text. While being capable of formulating their interpretation of the author’s notion, the readers will not possess a definitive idea of the actual message. In this scenario, the reader will not perceive the comprehensive picture and plausible cues or allegories of the writer. The outcome of this can be an erroneous interpretation of the writing or a distorted rendition.
Epilogue
Thus, writing is a means for writers to access the minds and musings of readers. With the aid of their writing, authors can impart their values and ideals to individuals. Nevertheless, decoding the messages of the writers can be a daunting task since many writers utilize allusions or allegories as channels of their notions. Consequently, it is imperative to heed the writer’s background and set of beliefs. In this scenario, the scrutiny of the author’s identity and standpoint is not solely the manner of enriching the understanding of the text but also the implement that aids in comprehending what impact this text should have had on the reader. Without the requisite information, the reader might not entirely grasp the message or formulate a distorted rendition of it.
