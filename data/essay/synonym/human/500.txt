Justice is crucial in a nation and should be implemented equally in criminal and societal arrangement. Social justice necessitates that everyone is granted equal economic, governmental, and societal privileges irrespective of their societal rank or racial background (Chisholm-Burns et al., 2021). During John F. Kennedy’s presidential campaign in 1965, he was displeased with youngsters loitering on the streets while others were in school. John F. Kennedy perceived the necessity to foster a culture of education for all youngsters in the United States. Eradicating the hopelessness in youngsters would demand disrupting the cycle of poverty that was inherited from generation to generation through education. The initiative to run Head Start was to advocate social justice in education for youngsters. Head Start was launched and began in the summer of 1965 by Lyndon Baines Johnson (Pillay, 2018). This essay will examine the role of the Head Start initiative in the advancement of social justice in the US, concentrating on the principles imparted to the youngsters and the activities that make up the initiative.
Promotion of social justice through Head Start is evident in its drive to instill cognitive and emotional growth of youngsters from low-income households below five years old in readiness for school. The youngsters under the initiative would miss out on education if they were deprived of the chance (Johnson & Jackson, 2019). The youngsters in the initiative are educated enduring skills of upholding social justice for all races and backgrounds.
The initiative’s selection procedure is an open and justifiable process. When a family is chosen for the initiative, assistance is provided based on the family’s requirements. Case workers make regular visits to the residences to determine how best they can aid the families. The necessities that can be tackled include health issues and parenting abilities to substance abuse and alcoholism. The focus of the social workers on the chosen families is maintained on the identified issues.
Head Start delivers clinical services to the selected families. Head Start offers therapy to individuals and youngsters either in groups or individually, depending on the families' needs. The initiative’s other clinical services consist of diagnosing health issues such as worry or despondency, among other health problems (Williams et al., 2018). Mental health difficulties are prevalent in low-income families due to struggles in meeting their everyday needs. The social workers collaborating with the initiative are highly skilled and can provide psychological evaluations to the families and visit them at home to offer therapy and intervention in emergency situations (Nix et al., 2018). The workers can reassess the family’s requirements upon new findings and support the family in additional needs not initially included.
To grant equal chances to the community, the initiative's social workers arrange outreach events in schools, community gatherings, and churches to inform the community about Head Start activities. Educating the community about Head Start enables every family eligible to enroll in the initiative to have an opportunity to receive assistance. The outreach team disperses enrollment forms that outline the prerequisites for a family and child to be registered in the initiative (Gatewood, 2019). The social workers urge the participants of the arranged gatherings to share the details with other community members who may be eligible but have not been informed about the Head Start initiative. Spreading awareness encourages equal opportunity for the community to enroll in the initiative and subsequently advance social justice.
Accountability is highly esteemed at the Head Start initiative through documentation. The records of enrolled families are updated promptly in case of alterations. The files of the families' requirements are revised whenever evaluations are carried out. The workers conduct regular checks to monitor the progress of the families and youngsters following the initial requirements. The Head Start initiative may remove a family from the program if there is a shift in societal status, and a needy family on the waiting list is added to ensure equal opportunities for the community. The papers for income verification and treatment plans are reviewed frequently to retain only the families deserving of the services.
In conclusion, when discussing social justice in early childhood education, we must consider the significance of comprehending what it signifies and what is necessary to achieve equality in early childhood education. Head Start closes the divide among youngsters under the age of five in readiness for their school enrollment. Social justice should not cease with Head Start once the youngsters surpass the qualifying age. Educators in various schools should impart the correct principles that advocate social justice by setting an example and theoretically instilling the appropriate values in youngsters. Society should denounce bias of any kind due to economic status or advantage by imparting good ethics to the younger generation.
