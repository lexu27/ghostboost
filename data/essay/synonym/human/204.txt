Lawsuit Overview
The lawsuit involves Christopher Lee Peterson, during the time of occurrences a staff member of Wilmur Communications and a disciple of the World Church of the Creator. In 2000, Peterson provided an interview to the nearby publication regarding WCC, articulating his prejudiced opinions, which encompassed the backing of a known assailant that singled out African-American, Jewish, and Asian individuals. Upon discovering the interview, the company CEO suspended Peterson without salary and subsequently demoted him to a reduced pay and accountability position. As per Title VII, which prohibits bias based on religious views, the complainant took legal action against the entity for the demotion.
Innovation, or the World Church of the Creator, is a self-proclaimed faith with its convictions focused on white supremacy and the preservation of racial purity. The radical entity was founded in 1973 by Ben Klassen, and following his suicide in 1993, Matt Hale assumed the role of the leader (“Creativity Movement,” n.d.). According to the originator, Klassen, the entity and its supporters strive for a “total war” against all “goddamned mud races” (“Creativity Movement,” n.d.), as he perceived the White Race as elite and superior to other races. Despite the group deeming itself a religion, it did not endorse any deities and viewed race as the utmost sacred truth (“Creativity Movement,” n.d.). Additionally, the adherents of WCC contended that the Holocaust was a fabrication and that an ideal world comprises solely white individuals. Over time, the neo-Nazi organization drew in numerous violently inclined individuals, purportedly resulting in multiple assaults.
Peterson, who belonged to the group, supervised a team of both white and non-white subordinates. In March 2000, the plaintiff featured in the local newspaper, which was conducting a segment on the WCC. The article confirmed Peterson’s viewpoints and beliefs as aligned with those of the WCC, along with a picture of Peterson paying homage to a mass assailant. While Peterson’s beliefs resembled those of the KKK and arguably unethical, his dismissal was deemed illegal and religiously biased by the court.
Legal Questions
An employer’s response to the news article
If I were the employer who came across this news article, I would seek a lawful means to dismiss the employee. As an employer, it is my obligation to uphold a functional and secure workplace. Therefore, encountering an article that could potentially unsettle some employees would prompt me to question the suitability of the individual making these assertions for the organization. If the employees are unable to feel secure in the work environment, then I, as the employer, would be accountable for fostering such an environment. Although, to the best of my knowledge in this scenario, the employee had not acted upon his beliefs and had merely been expressing them, I would not wish to be responsible if he did. Moreover, the fact that the employee had non-white individuals under his supervision makes the public backing of the racist mass assailant in the newspaper a fairly explicit threat. Consequently, it would be simpler to remove the problematic employee from the workplace before he escalated.
The court’s ruling reflection
The court ruling is entirely valid in legal terms, as the demotion was explicitly justified as a consequence of the employee’s religious beliefs. However, it is astonishing that the World Church of the Creator was acknowledged by the court as a religion in the first instance. Firstly, Creativity not only does not endorse any gods but also anything metaphysical or mystical. Secondly, Peterson’s faith is considerably founded on racism and white supremacy and has previously been associated with violence towards non-white members of society. Although Creativity fulfills the criteria for a religion necessitated to judge the case in accordance with Title VII, the ethics as delineated in the White Man’s Bible are inherently disruptive. While ethics are subjective in most instances, having a moral code that centers on discrimination and violence to achieve “purity” contradicts a secure and effective workplace environment. Therefore, despite the legality of the court’s ruling, it is equally within the company’s rights to demote Peterson.
An employer’s actions if an employee mistreated non-white employees in the workplace
As the employer, as previously mentioned, it is my duty to ensure the safety of the workplace. Mistreatment of non-white employees by other staff members is a severe issue and would necessitate disciplinary hearings to investigate the incident. There exists a certain culture in the corporate world to overlook problematic situations for the sake of long-term profit, particularly if the wrongdoer was a particularly valuable asset. However, while profit is typically one of the primary objectives of a company, I, as the employer, would commit to valuing the employees. This would involve disciplining those who disrupt the workplace, without displaying favoritism. Therefore, depending on the severity of the offense determined, the repercussions for such mistreatment could vary from a warning to termination.
