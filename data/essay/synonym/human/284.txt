The initial farewell address to the nation in US history was conducted by the country’s primary chosen president, George Washington. In the autumn of 1796, a letter of 32 handwritten pages was printed in the Philadelphia Daily Advertiser. This speech, which turned into Washington’s real political will, is still deemed one of the most crucial records in American history. Washington’s address included numerous concepts that for over two hundred years persist to have a direct impact on US foreign and domestic policy, as well as on the process of formation of the American nation. The primary thing that Washington did was that he declined to hold the presidency for more than two terms, even though he had the right to do so: the modification to the US Constitution that legitimized this rule was approved only in 1947.

Evaluating Washington’s parting speech, it should be pointed out that the president not only bid goodbye but also provided instructions to the entire nation. He considered the most crucial element of the success of the state and society to be the preservation and advancement of peaceful coexistence with all forces. Such forces encompass not solely neighboring states but also diverse races and religions. Washington himself frequently refers to God’s laws, believing that they condemn any discord or disrespect (Sands, 2019). Just as in the Bible there is a prohibition on the creation of an idol, so the president did not recommend becoming attached to any influential players in the political arena; instead, he insists on America’s independent incremental development.

Nevertheless, Washington’s stance on racial conflicts and divisions is highly unclear. On the one hand, the president proposes a respectful and peaceful coexistence of all representatives of the races to create a single full-fledged society. Conversely, the founding father did not vigorously oppose slavery, which conflicts with his position in farewell (Hayes, 2020). This does not signify that Washington is behaving hypocritically or having double standards because it is worth contemplating the context of the times. Nonetheless, there is a viewpoint in which racial coexistence should not be ascribed to the principles of the president.

It is also noteworthy that Washington has indicated potential red flags for the state, as well as released several cautions to the nation. Washington cautioned that the most serious threat to American democracy arose from internal disunity rather than outside interference (Sands, 2019). He foresaw the prospect of foreign influence on the American political system and the rise to power of a president who, neglecting national interests, would become the embodiment of the threat of despotism. He implored the Almighty to alleviate the consequences of presidential errors and expressed the hope that America would pardon him (Sands, 2019). Washington has established a standard for its moral decay, fearing that its self-importance could evolve into a threat to democracy.

Washington’s most far-reaching alerts concerned the threat of secession. In his viewpoint, if one group begins to dominate the other, then this can lead to a more structured and lasting despotism. This clarifies the perspective that it was defying Washington’s alerts that Donald Trump became president (Sands, 2019). Firstly, such notions are widespread among Trump’s adversaries, which is maintained by the president’s adversarial attitude towards Mexicans. The ascent of the despot will be fueled by chaos and suffering which will ultimately compel the citizens to seek security in the guise of absolute power of one individual (Sands, 2019). Consequently, Washington primarily warned the nation against potential errors leading to the modification or obliteration of the democratic system of the state.

Based on the aforementioned, Washington is not just a president who bid farewell to the nation for the first time before departing, but also a type of visionary. He frequently reminds society of the significance and distinctiveness of democracy, the core of which is to ensure a superior quality of life. Concurrently, the president cautions citizens about potential errors that could lead to radical adverse changes. Finally, modern history demonstrates that some of Washington’s words were prophetic.
