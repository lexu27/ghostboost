Composition
Diamonds by Rihanna premiered on Elvis Duran Show on September 26, 2012, accessible for online download an hour after being released to the public, and was issued as the album’s primary single the following day. Sia composed the track for Rihanna, who possesses the track’s copyrights and labored on it a year earlier; hence, the track is possessed by an independent contractor (Anggraini 12). Unapologetic is Barbadian artist Rihanna’s seventh studio album, and the track “Diamonds” is featured on it (Anggraini 7). Utilizing Sia’s demonstration vocals as a reference, Rihanna mimicked her intonations to the exact minutest detail. It was only after Benny Blanco listened to the final track of the Australian songwriter did she realize the vocals belonged to her exclusively.
Inspiration
In Diamonds, Rihanna pondered the presence of both love and diamonds: “Yellow diamonds in the light. To make things even more awkward, we’re standing next to each other. You cross my path as your shadow does.” The diamonds in the track symbolize a silver lining that illustrates the opportunity for a better future and happier days among dark and gloomy days. The track prompted me to contemplate all the possibilities available when things do not turn out to be as I anticipated.
I also selected the track because of its delivery, which was both optimistic and hopeful, and I am always in a positive mood when I listen to it. It is also quite motivating because it urges listeners to cherish themselves. Since its debut, the track has garnered numerous accolades and has experienced substantial success for years. For Rihanna’s career, the track provided a significant boost because it was quite memorable, and everyone could identify it from the very initial moments of its playback.
