                    While appearing to be straightforward tales about Maidens in trouble, folk stories are brimming with concealed messages that influence children’s view of reality and impact their societal connections. Despite the fact that many folk stories have been edited and altered throughout the years, they often maintained their outdated and binary worldviews, expressing biased gender roles and societal standards, reinforced and disseminated through a system of incentive and discipline. Even in a more worldwide and progressive world, the underlying principles of these folk stories continue to impact children, frequently subconsciously, for the remainder of their lives. This study will investigate various folk stories, penned by the Grimm Siblings, such as Cinderella, Snow White, and Briar Rose (Sleeping Beauty) that illustrate, particularly controversial societal standards and gender roles. Through class debates and enactments children reassess connotations, scrutinize stereotypes and viewpoints they may have developed prematurely after initial reading the folk stories. While critical thinking is often viewed as a result of learning, maturity, and exposure, this study demonstrates that critical thinking is a competency that can be promoted and actively enhanced at a young age already. The advantages of nurturing and implementing critical thinking in young children in the context of folk stories are especially crucial as critical thinking helps alleviate the potent influence of these folk stories on the characters of young children.
Research Questions
This study aims to discover responses to the following inquiries:
1. How do specific Grimms’ folk stories influence children’s perception of reality?
2. Can we instill critical thinking in children by, for instance, involving the folk tale context critically through reading, analyzing, reenacting (role play), and discussing it with them?
3. After enhancing children’s critical thinking, can we observe changes in their assessments regarding societal standards?
4. What are the concerns, thoughts, or concepts that children mention concerning their perceptions of societal norms within examined folk stories?
Significance of the Investigation
In an era where children are exposed to a vast amount of information, often receiving conflicting messages, fostering critical thinking at a young age becomes particularly essential. Critical thinking abilities help students recognize different viewpoints and sources of information and consequently make them more empathetic towards other people’s opinions. Furthermore, being able to assess sources critically helps students evaluate content, potentially safeguarding them from manipulation. The benefits of thinking independently, reflectively, and innovatively that come with critical thinking are immense. Above all, fostering critical thinking aids students in their growth as well-rounded individuals, capable of making responsible and mature decisions in life.
Literature Examination
Folk stories
Folk stories are characterized as “conventional tales written for children that typically involves fantastical creatures and magic” (Cambridge dictionary). They are customarily intended for children and are distinguished by extraordinary and bizarre elements such as sorcerers, goblins, elves, as well as nixies. The phrase “folk” alludes to the magical and whimsical setting of these tales. The term does not allude to the fairy character that a specific story presents. “Folk stories are significant components of children’s literature that have had a long-lasting impact on our society” (Nanda, 2104, 1). Folk tales frequently refer to traditional tales that had been passed down from one generation to the next through storytelling before being published in magazines, chronicles, or books.
The Grimm Siblings
The Two early nineteenth century German authors, Jacob Ludwig Carl Grimm and Wilhelm Carl Grimm, compiled folk stories in what is commonly known as Grimm’s Folk Tales, including Hansel and Gretel, Little Red Riding Hood, Rumpelstiltskin, Snow White, The Seven Dwarfs, and numerous others. According to Zipes (2015, 115), the early stories gathered by the Grimm Siblings are sudden, blunt, ludicrous, amusing, and sorrowful and the Grimms siblings never intended that they would be read aloud to youngsters. The stories revolve around children and families and how they coped with challenging situations. The Grimms believed that the stories and morals arose naturally from the German people through an oral tradition, and they aimed to preserve them before the tales vanished forever. The Grimms made a unique contribution to folklore by amassing the tales. The Grimms aimed to transmit oral tales to the German people, not anticipating that these tales would become relevant in other cultures as well. Although Zipes (2015, 114) asserts that the narratives can be viewed as part of the German nationalist movement in the 19th century, they are also linked to stories from many other nations.
Critical Thinking
Critical thinking, among other things, aids students in comprehending different perspectives and envisioning life scenarios from different standpoints. The capacity to think critically reflectively facilitates developing judgments individually, responsibly, and more ethically, which has implications for various aspects in our lives, including decision-making. According to Florea and Hurjui (2015), critical thinking entails fact scrutiny in order to arrive at a conclusion or formulate a judgment. In other words, it is a fundamental skill that enriches learning during the early phases of life. According to the present educational scenario (static environment) and the evolution stage of critical thinking (dynamic environment), early learning activities and engagement activities are devised (Florea & Hurjui, 2015). There are diverse teaching techniques. Incorporating the composition skills of analyzing arguments, utilizing inductive or deductive reasoning for reasoning, judgment, or assessment, and making decisions or resolving predicaments. Prior knowledge about a given topic is a requisite, but not adequate condition for students to engage with the subject critically.
Critical thinking is a processing and problem-solving approach grounded on intelligent, logical, and coherent arguments. Additionally, it involves the selection, evaluation, and confirmation of the correct answer to a specific task. Critical thinking further furnishes valid grounds for rejecting alternative solutions offered during the process. It is the process of learning to consistently merge various types of data to present advantages and disadvantages, appraise them to ascertain the truth, modify information, and formulate new ideas. Moreover, it is a complex, organized, and constructive procedure indispensable in an individual’s daily life. Analogous to writing and reading, listening and speaking, it encompasses the thought process that originates from a point of accumulating positive data and employing it to derive rational outcomes.
Prior Studies on Folk Stories and Critical Thinking
According to recent research children engage in the same cognitive processes and are as capable of critical thinking as adults (Lai, 2011, 465). Folk stories play a vital role in aiding children to critically ponder on stereotypical nuances and gendered content narrated in various storybooks, preparing them for the challenges in the future. Transmitted through word of mouth from one generation to the next, storybooks are crucial for entertainment and education. Storybooks restate imaginary scenarios that stimulate the minds of children and thus encourage children to reflect, think critically, about various life situations. Children form opinions and make emotional judgments, face ethical dilemmas, recognize the significance of certain social situations and bonds, and formulate their own social responsibility (Lai, 2011, 466). Lai (2011, 466) adds that children are frequently able to distinctly appreciate the significance of family life, make significant decisions when encountering ethical dilemmas,
