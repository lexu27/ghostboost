Alteration of personal computers necessitated the advancement of more intricate hardware and software. For instance, buses, which function as the communication pathways between various internal components and peripheral devices, have progressed. Three categories of buses such as location, command, and information are recognized (Farret et al., 2017). The last one is employed for information interchange between the Central Processing Unit (CPU) and peripherals (Farret et al., 2017). The importance of the location bus is to support the CPU in identifying specific details in the memory, while the command bus manages data processing. Information buses are depicted as a multiple of two and presently consist of five variations: 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64 (Farret et al., 2017). These figures indicate the bits of data that can be transmitted simultaneously, and the larger ones enable a more substantial amount of information to be dealt with at once.
The quantity of parallel lines in a processor determines how many electric signals can be swapped between peripherals and the CPU. The most prevalent operating systems on contemporary computers are 32 and 64-bit microprocessors. A 32-bit data bus includes thirty-two parallel lines between distinct structures. Conversely, a 64-bit data bus comprises sixty-four lines, enabling it to execute twice as many data exchange procedures (Farret et al., 2017). Therefore, the fundamental contrast between these two types of data buses is the pace at which they can manage information. Likewise, the speed at which older versions process data relies on the quantity of paralleled copper wires between the CPU and other internal components. Undoubtedly, all these buses have one mutual purpose of swapping data, but they contrast in the speed at which operations are transmitted because of their structural distinctions.
