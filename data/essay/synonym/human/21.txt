The calculation of the three proportions
Return on Assets (RoA)
Return on Equity (RoE)
Profit Margin
The intention and details conveyed by each proportions
The three proportions presented and calculated in the prior segment signify crucial profit production indicators for a contemporary commercial organization. The return on assets (RoA) demonstrates how effectively the corporation utilizes all of its assets, including the borrowed ones, to produce financial returns. The return on equity is largely akin to this measure, but it does not account for the debt of the corporation (Gallo, 2016). Lastly, the profit margin is one of the most significant indicators of financial well-being, as it makes a direct comparison between sales and profits, illustrating how much the corporation actually earns from its operations.
ABC Company inspection on three proportions
Firstly, the ABC Company’s business model can be considered prosperous, as it generates sufficient profits. Optimum returns on equity and assets indicate that the investors can reasonably anticipate returns on their involvement in the corporation’s financing. The profit margin is also substantial, signifying that this aspect of the firm is managed effectively.
The profitability of the corporation
Overall, the ABC Company remains a lucrative enterprise that successfully converts its assets into revenues. The profit margin exceeds 50%, which is praiseworthy, even though the overall turnover is below $1 million. Hence, the business model by itself operates effectively, enabling the ABC Company to maintain a secure position in the market. Nevertheless, it may not be adequate for sustained growth in the long run.
ABC Company financially successful
While the ABC Company’s financial statement may exhibit positive indicators, it would be imprudent to evaluate the corporation in isolation. Instead, it seems intriguing to compare the entity’s performance against the industry’s frontrunners to pinpoint the areas in which it excels or where enhancements are required. Initially, the return on assets is reported by Rose (2022), indicating that the industry’s average was established at 9.1-9.3% over the past four years. The ABC Company’s figures are markedly higher currently at 28.3%, but it is crucial to acknowledge that its absolute cash flows do not align with the industry’s leaders. Consequently, it is plausible that the ABC Company’s proportions will decrease as the entity continues to expand.
This contrast becomes notably clear when the income levels are juxtaposed with the industry’s average figures. Concerning net income, the industry has averaged $4.7 million in 2020. The ABC Company falls short of this level, as its net income is solely $77,000, suggesting that it still has an extensive growth phase ahead. Furthermore, the industry’s top performers, such as Williams-Sonoma, have hundreds of millions in sales, while the ABC Company only has half-a-million. As the total assets of the corporation rise, there is no assurance that its profit margins and returns on investment will remain equally high. Under these circumstances, the focus will be on upholding the profitability of operations above the average level across the industry.
