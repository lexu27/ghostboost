In numerous countries, faith is still a highly delicate subject that could result in serious breaches of human rights and respect. North Korea is especially infamous for its repressive political system where individuals essentially lack civil liberties and the freedom to articulate their beliefs. As per regulations, North Korea does not forbid any faiths; nonetheless, in practice, most convictions are actively oppressed (Burkle, 2020).
Linda Burkle (2020) elaborates that Christians are among the most suppressed factions in North Korea. Consequently, Open Doors 2020 World Watch List designated North Korea as the most dreadful nation for Christian individuals to reside in (Burkle, 2020). Christians are relocated to work camps and penitentiaries, while about 200,000 Christians have also vanished for "unidentified causes" (Burkle, 2020). Even obtaining holy scripts is unattainable and could result in incarceration and torment.
Regrettably, other nations do not intervene in North Korea's internal matters due to vast disparities in political systems and the potential for conflict. The North Korean administration is widely recognized for its cruel statutes and strategies while upholding substantial military capability and atomic weapons. Hence, other nations strive to secure a diplomatic resolution and refrain from meddling with faiths within the nation. Regarding rationale, North Korea prosecutes Christians because the government thinks that religious individuals subvert national principles and unity. North Korea arose post-World War II and gradually heightened the strictness of political command. Consequently, for over 70 years, the North Korean administration has been actively pursuing religious assemblies and, specifically, Christians to diminish the dissemination of liberty. It is an unfair strategy, but, regrettably, other nations can do little to assist oppressed religious individuals in North Korea.
