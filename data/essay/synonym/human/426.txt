The apparel sector is among the numerous monopolistically competitive industries. There are multiple garment companies in the sector vying against each other while manufacturing akin products. Nonetheless, the companies in the sector gain competitive advantages by differentiating their products through branding and promotions (Davis and Özgür, 4). Product distinction is one of the tactics frequently utilized by monopolistic competitive companies. Product distinction in an apparel company can encompass styles, the grade of materials utilized, and the rates charged for the garments. In promotions, distinction is incorporated in tangible aspects such as hue, styles, stretchable, and various sizes (Davis and Özgür, 7). Intangible aspects featured in the apparel promotion may involve assured refunds, premium quality, complimentary shipping, and enduring utilization. Steel production is an illustration of an oligopolistic competitive sector. In such a market, a handful of steel production enterprises dominate over other companies. The few companies are the rate and trendsetters for other minor companies and frequently forge a collaboration to function effectively (Ritz 185). To set themselves apart from their rivals, they enhance their product quality, escalate or diminish rates, and publicize the distinct characteristics of their products. In an oligopolistic market, if a top company reduces rates, the rest do not follow but rather boost their products to stay in the upper echelons of rates (Ritz 187). The few leading companies also continue to be competitive in the sector by establishing their standards high to hinder effortless entry into the sector. The companies set high standards by producing the finest quality products, vending them at a higher price, and manufacturing them in large quantities (Ritz 189). In this manner, they guarantee that the minor or new companies dread the competition at the peak thus ensuring diminished entry to the sector.
