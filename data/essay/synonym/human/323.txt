The inception of computer technologies in contemporary society encompasses numerous activities that appear to be unrelated to computer technologies per se, such as the hiring process. With the proliferation of corporate culture and the evolution of a more cutthroat market of candidates, a thorough candidate selection process necessitated a more direct solution than manual filtering. Lately, following the evaluation of the potential widespread use of newly developed AI technologies, Human Resource managers commenced utilizing program software to lessen the workload associated with the selection process. The piece by Pardes delves into how the candidates mastered the art of influencing the technology to serve their own interests.
The piece commences with an interview with the individual who unearthed the consistent patterns in the operation of the software’s candidate selection system, Shirin Nilizadeh. According to Pardes, an acquaintance approached Nilizadeh with worries regarding her curriculum vitae. Alizadeh’s acquaintance has deduced that her resumes fail to reach HR managers as they inexplicably appear to lack something. Through a series of enhancements to an assortment of arbitrary resumes, Nilizadeh determined that utilizing particular words not necessarily linked to requisite qualifications can enhance the candidates’ standing in the resume-ranking program. While Nilizadeh’s focus was academic, numerous platforms provide candidates with opportunities to enhance their resumes with all sorts of tricks, like embedding relevant keywords in invisible font. It transpires that there are myriad methods for candidates to boost their chances of securing an interview, ranging from including the names of esteemed universities to employing rival company names and replicating job description specifics.
Further in the piece, the author elucidates that concentrating on efficacy can lead to excessively glorifying technology. One of the interviewees in the piece, Joseph Fuller, proposes that an excessive reliance on artificial intelligence in the recruitment process could pave the way for “a high-tech pathway to discrimination” (quoted in Pardes). Hence, lacking knowledge of the essential keywords or employing different formulations for the existing skills may prevent a significant portion of job seekers from progressing to the subsequent phase of the selection process. According to Julie Schweber’s viewpoint highlighted in Pardes’ piece, software screens out up to 75% of applicants based on the resume aligning with the specific job requirements. The problem is exacerbated by the fact that external parties offer paid resume enhancement and applicant tracking systems, influencing the competitiveness of the labor market by favoring applicants with financial resources.
Scrutinizing the insights gleaned from the piece underscores the impersonal nature of technology. While leveraging technology to streamline organizational processes can enhance efficiency, it erects a barrier for individuals lacking adequate technological proficiency. Moreover, an excessive dependence on technology engenders process vulnerabilities that can be exploited for malicious or detrimental objectives. Consequently, even though the utilization of technology ostensibly enhances objectivity in decision-making, potential manipulations can nullify the impacts of favoritism, corruption, and bribery.
Ultimately, I opted to select this piece because it exposes the flaws of technological systems and their inappropriate utilization in contemporary society. It was intriguing to discover the impact of distinctions between human and machine perceptions when interpreting the text written in white color on white paper. Gaining an additional perspective from the recruitment process can assist me in identifying potential errors and threats in my forthcoming career as an IT professional.
