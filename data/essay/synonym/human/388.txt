Delegation is the solution to success in any kind of organization, but it can present a significant challenge in church administration. Many ministry leaders, accustomed to working independently, struggle to conceive that others can manage tasks more efficiently. Nevertheless, as the church expands, it becomes essential to enlist the assistance of additional church personnel or volunteers. When leaders attempt to handle all duties alone, their efforts are directed towards tasks that are beyond their responsibilities (Kouzes & Posner, 2017). This diminishes the efficacy of church leadership, which is unacceptable. This issue becomes even more pressing when inexperienced and young church leaders are involved. They might believe they possess the energy to oversee all areas, but the truth is that multitasking can rapidly overwhelm them. To address the outlined issue, it would be ideal to employ a methodical approach characterized by a comprehensive evaluation of the situation and making logical decisions based on it.

Crucial stakeholders include senior pastoral leadership, distinct church leadership (elders, deacons), and volunteer leaders designated to partake in the delegation process. When assigning responsibilities to others, it is crucial to clearly communicate what is expected of them and also delineate their duties in detail. The optimal resolution is to foster a culture of empowerment where leaders promptly inspire and empower employees and volunteers to engage in various endeavors.

Young leaders often exacerbate the situation by taking on too many tasks. They are eager to assist employees because such demands create the perception of their indispensability, value, authority, and trust from the team. Novice leaders fail to allocate time to address higher-level and higher-priority tasks by immersing themselves in every issue. The leader may shoulder the responsibility of resolving an employee's issues, rationalizing their actions with their incompetence. However, such motives can lead to the pitfall of reverse delegation. In such instances, it is preferable to delegate the task to an employee capable of resolving it under the guidance of a more seasoned team member.

The core of effective delegation is to plan the task and structure the work process to accomplish the objectives as swiftly and efficiently as possible. The issue of excessive workload can result in rapid burnout of the manager, dissatisfaction among subordinates, or simply a lack of focus. This results in diminished motivation among subordinates and reduced efficiency in their work. Inexperienced leaders run the risk of falling into the trap of reverse delegation: where they end up performing the work meant for a subordinate themselves. Concurrently, the workload left for the leader to address continually increases. The diagram below illustrates the primary reasons behind delegation problems arising (Figure 1).

Inadequate leadership is detrimental to companies that profit from their activities. For instance, employee turnover amounts to $5,500 per employee (Bartram, 2019). In a company with 250 employees, this translates to a quarter of a million dollars per year (Bartman, 2019). Certainly, these financial figures have limited relevance in a church context, but its purpose is to attract followers. If inexperienced leaders make critical leadership errors, decreased attendance and reduced employee satisfaction with their time at the church are expected.

The 5 Whys technique is apt for resolving delegation issues. The initial query is, why does the delegation dilemma arise? The response is that this challenge emerges due to ineffective management. The subsequent question is, why is ineffective management prevalent in churches? Errors stem from the inexperience of employees and their lack of understanding of fundamental leadership principles. The third question is, why is delegation crucial in the church? This mechanism is vital as it enables more efficient management of the organization and frees up the leader for more pressing tasks. The fourth question is, why might churches be hesitant to implement this approach? The fear of altering the power structure within a conservative organization like the church can instigate distrust. The final question is, why is it still worthwhile to utilize delegation? This mechanism is proven to enhance the functionality of the church and assist young leaders in gaining confidence.

Assigning authority and diverse tasks in the Christian church is an indispensable skill that every leader must possess. This tool boosts group productivity and provides others with the opportunity to learn and develop to share in successes. By delegating tasks to others, church leaders are essentially granting them the opportunity to serve. Knowledgeable leaders achieve superior outcomes by enlisting individuals with various talents and capabilities to support them. The capacity to delegate to another person creates room for collaborative discussion, for cooperative work. This is precisely the skill, the endeavor, because engaging in dialogue is impossible without humility. Without delegation, it is impractical to involve the other participant in the collaborative process to share their viewpoint and knowledge. Delegating authority can enhance the operation of the church and facilitate serving young leaders who have not yet acquired all the necessary skills for effective leadership.
