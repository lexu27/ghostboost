Deity is the supreme arbiter who assesses individuals based on their deeds impartially; if individuals supplicate and have faith in him, he mends and provides what he wishes. Meanwhile, non-believers argue that Deity does not exist because there are still conflicts and acts of extremism in which blameless victims are slain (Krause & Ironson, 2019). This does not align with what can be found in the scriptures and the Bible. It can be contended that the Almighty is the overseer; once there is uncertainty about the presence of this guardian, a person who is a potential wrongdoer is capable of anything.
However, Deityâ€™s court is not the sole court in front of which an individual can be held accountable. Therefore, if Deity did not exist, individuals would still be constrained by other influences, but jointly, divine and worldly potential penalties function as restraining forces against all-powerful behavior. It is vital to mention Polytheism and the Christian faith, where the notions of good and evil differ. For instance, sorcery is prohibited by the Almighty, but allowed in heathen ceremonies (Krause & Ironson, 2019). Concurrently, Christianity establishes the uniform just regulations for all, but Polytheism is the privilege of particular persons and embraced by the powers of the deities, which is not just.
