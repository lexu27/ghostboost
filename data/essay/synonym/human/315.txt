The initial reference to a homosexual act is discovered in the Old Testament Book of Leviticus. It is stated there in a restrictive way: “Do not lie down with a man as with a woman: this is an abomination.” (Leviticus 18:22) The Apostle Paul states the following: “Just as men, having rejected natural intercourse with women, burn with desire for one another: men commit disgraceful acts with men, preparing for themselves the punishment that they deserve, having gone astray.” (Rom 1:27) Initially, when discussing homosexuality – the scriptures mention “intercourse” or “desire,” but not orientation in the sense that homosexual individuals today have in mind – an equal affectionate relationship between two partners of the same sex. Homosexual relationships have been present at all times and in all cultures. Nevertheless, the concept of “orientation” as an attribute inherent in a specific individual is relatively recent; it emerges only towards the conclusion of the 19th century, complicating a direct comparison of the phenomenon of homosexuality in the Christian context (Kuefler 1256). The second crucial aspect is contrasting religious texts of homosexual relationships with a relationship with women. Homosexuality was present in antiquity and the Medieval era – but it was never perceived as a comparable bond. In the Christian realm, the penalty was expected for sodomites. In England, sodomites were put to death until the New Era; for an extended period, homosexuals were among the subjects of the Inquisition. The Code of Justinian in Byzantium prescribed harsh penalties for them: up to castration and capital punishment. Given the profound religiosity within the authorities, such prosecution was endorsed by religious implications. However, there was no equivalent contemporary comprehension of the bond, not even on a philosophical level: such occurrences were a deviation from the standard and were not fundamentally accepted.
