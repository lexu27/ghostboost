One of the most noteworthy forms of American folklore, which established the basis for such musical genres as gospel, blues, and jazz, was the spiritual chants of African Americans. The forebears of African Americans were forcibly separated from their homes and brought to the United States to work on the plantations of the Old South. Progeny of hundreds of different tribes in Africa brought distinctive musical traditions that were destined to have a global impact on world culture. Spirituals were generally regarded as religious music, but they held a much deeper significance to the individuals who composed and performed them. African Americans encountered severe restrictions even in arts and music. White planters attempted to divide the communities to prevent riots, and at times slaves were prohibited from speaking their native language (Music for emancipation of African Americans, 2016-2017). Music has become a primary means of expressing inner emotions, grief, sorrow, and a sense of unity with brothers and sisters in distress. It is a narrative about the resilience of the human spirit, genuine respect for ancestors, and faith in the future.
Frederick Douglas was born in 1818 in the US state of Maryland into a family of slaves. He detested American slave laws and actively sought to shed light on the horrifying events occurring in the country. Frederick Douglas's lifelong objective was to combat slavery in all its forms, promote complete emancipation, and elevate the moral standards of society. He viewed musical creativity as a method of uplifting spirits, effectively fighting for a promising future, and a demonstration of cultural pride. Slave owners frequently failed to grasp the true essence of this art form and demanded that the slaves sing for their amusement. Frederick Douglas chronicled in his autobiography how obligatory singing stifled him in childhood and how distinct it was from singing from the heart (Music for emancipation of African Americans, 2016-2017). In a perpetual feeling of homesickness and sorrow over the harsh outlook of the planters, music emerged as a source of declaration of Blacks' beliefs and transmissions to the world. Delving into Douglas's work and the history of African American culture necessitates holding these concepts in mind to gain a better understanding of the origins of the music and its communication to the world.
William Edward Burghardt Du Bois was a prominent American historian, sociologist, and public figure. He was born into a destitute family of farmers, but his exceptional talents enabled him to elevate himself out of poverty and become the first black graduate of Harvard University. He was the author of numerous books and articles on the history of peoples of African descent and their struggle against racism, slavery, and the slave trade. His works encompassed visions for autonomy and the advancement of the prosperous traditions of African culture, narratives, and dramas about the life of African Americans. In music, he perceived the genuine sentiments of his ancestors, but specifically through the lens of the Christian faith. A thorough examination of spirituals commenced primarily with the works of Du Bois, his concluding chapter of The Souls of the Black Folk, titled The Sorrow Songs (Music for emancipation of African Americans, 2016-2017). He regarded spirituals as anthems of self-determination and an expression of divine religious faith, communicated to God. It is a slightly different approach to the perception of African slave music, further revealing the religious facet and its context.
It is crucial to understand that one of the reasons individuals willingly converted to Christianity was the uncovered parallel in biblical narratives with their actual lives. The words were biblical, but the implications and meanings in songs were profoundly personal. Individuals could articulate their inner anguish, protests, and the compelling sense of injustice. Gradually, the Christian faith became the spiritual pillar of the slaves, which can be discerned in the writer's works concerning African American culture. The music of African slaves can be interpreted from various perspectives, emphasizing religion or, conversely, contemplating it purely as a means to conceal the genuine meaning from oppressors. The central concept remains steadfast: this is a monumental cultural legacy and the inception of the prosperous campaign for freedom and equality.
