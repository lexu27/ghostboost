Synopsis
The warmer and the pump providing oil are designed to utilize electricity primarily from a generator without the need of any backup boiler when it is not in use for an extended period. The process is intended to uphold the oil temperature in the service container utilized. The backup boiler is primarily powered by the fuel oil combusting. Consequently, steam is produced, which is utilized to power a heating loop to sustain the oil service tank temperature. A warmer is purposed to warm the oil, which is invariably kept in the oil service tank; this furnishes heat for the preservation of the oil temperature from dropping. There exists the pump for oil distribution with the principal role of boosting the oil flow from the container passing through a warmer and returning to the oil container once more; thereby, the oil temperature is preserved.
