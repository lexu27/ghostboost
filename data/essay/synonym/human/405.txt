Introduction The heater and the pump supplying oil are made to use electricity mainly from a generator without the operation of any auxiliary boiler when it is not in operation for a long time. The subprogram be meant to maintain the temperature of the oil in the service tank used. The ancillary boiler is mainly operated by the fuel oil getting burnt. Thus steam is generated, which is work on generating a heating coil to maintain the temperature of the oil service tank. A heater is meant to heat the oil, which is always stored in the oil service tank; this provides heating plant for the upkeep of the temperature of the petroleum from going down. There is the pump for supplying oil with the main subroutine of enhancing the circulation of oil from the tank passing through a heater and back to the oil tank again; the temperature of the oil is thus maintained.
