The caregiver must acquire details on Alyssa's medical background and the results of the bodily assessment to suggest appropriate actions. Alyssa was diagnosed with Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD), which might pose an additional risk for other heart issues. The child's present symptoms consist of noticeably quick heartbeat, lightheadedness, paleness, and increased perspiration. She has already encountered the same symptoms, indicating that her condition could be recurring. The caregiver must assess the cardiac output rate determined by the pulse rate and the stroke volume, heart sounds, and calcium level. The bodily assessment results might reveal some acquired cardiovascular condition, such as supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), whose primary symptom is the heightened pulse rate. The data gathered from the bodily assessment will impact the nursing strategy and the required nursing actions.
The caregiver should assist Alyssa and carefully observe her status. The primary nursing action should be evaluating pulse rate and blood pressure. It is crucial to monitor these indicators as compensatory tachycardia and reduced blood pressure may suggest decreased cardiac output. The subsequent nursing measure is overseeing an electrocardiogram (ECG) for pulse rate, rhythm, and ectopy. This will aid in detecting heart rhythm irregularities and tachycardia affecting cardiac output. The third nursing step includes offering sufficient periods of rest to lessen myocardial and oxygen necessity. These are three critical actions that Alyssa's caregiver must execute.
Another crucial action is administering the prescribed medication - adenosine. Adenosine is one of the medications listed as antiarrhythmic agents. Adenosine slows down "conduction through the atrioventricular (AV) node, extends the refractory period, and diminishes automaticity in the AV node." It has a brief period of effectiveness (around 15 seconds) and may result in a few minor side effects, such as headache, flushing, and brief breathlessness. Antiarrhythmic drugs are typically not given to children unless they have had heart surgery or, as in Alyssa's situation, possess innate heart problems. Therefore, Alyssa should be supervised by the caregiver after the drug's administration to identify potential adverse effects. This comprises the essential pharmacological and administration information concerning adenosine.
The caregiver needs to deliver thorough patient and family medication education prior to Alyssa's release. It should encompass digoxin's impacts and potential side effects, which should be promptly reported to the healthcare provider if observed, the dosage, and the compatibility with other medications. Digoxin (or Lanoxin) is a medication used to "enhance the force of heart contractions." It slows down calcium exiting the cell, boosting the action potential and "retarding conduction and pulse rate." Alyssa's guardians should notify the healthcare provider of any modifications in her diet and medications to prevent adverse effects. Concerning compatibility, it is forbidden to combine digoxin with St. John's wort, quinidine, rifampin, and midodrine. Before giving the dose, it is crucial to count the apical pulse for a complete minute and hold back if it is below 90. Avoiding the oral form of digoxin with meals is recommended. Digoxin has narrow safety thresholds for the dosage, particularly for children. Thus, it is imperative for Alyssa's guardians not to disregard the caregiver's advice on its administration.
