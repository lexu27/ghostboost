In the article under examination, Putnam aims to explore the essence of suffering, particularly to determine whether it is a cerebral condition or not. He emphasizes the disparity of brain configuration in different life forms using the instance of an octopus and a mammal, from which the contrast in their "physical-chemical" operation arises (Putnam, p. 56). Put simply, the methods in which activity takes place in the brain may vary from one form of it to another. This, as per Putnam, leads to the inference that physical reactions most organisms display, including suffering, are not exclusively cerebral conditions.
A crucial subtlety, which the philosopher emphasizes, is that such responses usually exhibit themselves in specific conduct that aids in identifying the condition. For example, it can be inferred that a particular organism is undergoing suffering, hunger, unfavorable temperature, or other sensations from its motions or the noises it is producing (Putnam, p. 56). This helps to demonstrate that the conditions are not confined to alterations in brain activity but can also influence its physical counterpart; thus, it is more logical to view them as intricate. Specifically, the phrase Putnam suggests to categorize fundamental physiological reaction to irritants, which disrupt the well-being of an organism, is "a functional condition" (p. 54). His theory argues that to sense pain, a living being must possess a suitable form of functional arrangement, which effectively dictates this state, rendering it physically viable.
In more basic terms, Putnam dismisses the identical nature of psychological and physical attributes, which both theoretically are interconnected up to inseparability. Horowitz notes that such a perspective falls under the philosophy of "type-physicalism" (p. 81). Meanwhile, Putnam terms it "the cerebral condition hypothesis" (p. 55). His primary argument against it, as stated, lies in the fact that psychological states can exhibit diverse behavioral indications, thus, they scarcely share specific physical attributes.
Putnam’s viewpoint undoubtedly aligns more closely with reality compared to type-physicalism, chiefly because of ample empirical proof. Indeed, distinct creatures may behave differently when in distress; hence, they might convulse or contract, weep, groan, or clench, among other responses. Moreover, numerous species, including humans but not exclusively them, can mask their unease to evade being overly exposed. These are illustrations to clarify that physiology-rooted reaction to irritants, like suffering, is "multiply achievable" (Horowitz, p. 82). This presumption, in essence, distinguishes mental characteristics from physical since otherwise, all entities capable of experiencing pain would act uniformly.
It is noteworthy that some philosophers endeavored to challenge the credibility of Putnam’s argument, asserting that, although the nature of pain seemingly differs among different species, it is uniform within one. This assertion, however, is fallacious as well; empirical data demonstrate that the functional composition of the brain, even in humans, can change. For instance, a severe injury to specific brain regions can result in a scenario where the others begin to carry out their functions, facilitating the organism to regain equilibrium (Horowitz, p. 82). This indeed presents another instance of how the realization of psychological states can be multiple, which is observable even within a single species. Therefore, it is more apt to categorize suffering as a function focusing on the conduct that reveals it.
To conclude, the hypothesis which Putnam labels as the cerebral condition theory and vehemently opposes is dubious. Notably, the proponents of this standpoint equate psychological states with physical, asserting that the former, including suffering, possess distinct physical attributes. However, in such a scenario, the actions of organisms in pain would also be identical, which, as empirical data reveals, does not align with reality.
