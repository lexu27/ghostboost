A strategy synopsis is a brief explanation of a specific matter. The brief strategy targets government policymakers or stakeholders who form or influence policy. A strategy synopsis offers sufficient context for the reader to grasp the issue and convince them to address it promptly. It identifies the most efficient solutions to the issue and provides evidence to support them. The strategy synopsis encourages the reader to make the optimal decision possible. A quality strategy synopsis should be brief and focused on meanings rather than procedures. It should focus on a single matter or concern and provide ample evidence from multiple sources (“2022 NACo Legislative Conference Livestreams”, 2022).
Strategy Synopses on the State, Local, and Federal Issue
1st strategy synopsis
Rising Food Prices – A national crisis
Steps to eradicate poverty and hunger
Rising food prices present a challenge to the impoverished, government of low-income nations with high import bills, and aid organizations managing increased demand for cash and food. The impoverished cannot afford food. Low-income nations confront political turmoil. The issue stems from a lack of better investment in the food sector and poor management of the national food reserve (Lubell, 2021).
What occurs and why?
Initially, food prices were reasonable as the farmers and the government had invested significantly in the agricultural sector. Since 2000, food prices have begun to rise due to the increased cost of fertilizers, farm machinery, and chemicals. Price hikes were a result of fuel price increases.
Impact on the impoverished, low-income nations, and agricultural industries
The impoverished allocate most of their earnings to food; thus, rising food prices lead to excessive spending, which is unsustainable. Elevated food prices result in increased transportation costs that impact farmers' earnings. Low-income nations face pressure from the bills, resulting in limited economic advancement and expansion (Lubell, 2021).
Strategy recommendation
Immediate action is necessary to alleviate distress arising from escalating food prices, and additional resources are required to support WEP and aid developing nations with high import bills. Appropriate policies are needed to assist farmers in increasing food production.
Conclusion
Appropriate measures are essential to regulate food prices and foster economic growth. The government must control oil prices to enable farmers and the agricultural sector to reduce their income expenditure, thereby lowering food prices.
2nd strategy synopsis
Natural resources: climate change challenge
Recent climate changes have occurred in countries unable to manage the transition. Developing nations are the most impacted as they rely on natural resources. These countries face global warming due to industrialization. Effective natural resource management leads to climate-friendly and sustainable development.
Land degradation
Many lands suffer from soil erosion due to deforestation and poor environmental management, such as inadequate farming and grazing practices.
Scarce rainfall
Insufficient rain results in low crop yields and desertification. Farmers encounter challenges in planning crop cultivation, impacting a developing nation.
Strategy recommendation
The government safeguards water catchment regions and natural forests in arid and semi-arid areas. The government supports farm-level interventions to address climate change.
Conclusion
Effective measures must be implemented to address adverse weather changes contributing to climate change (Lubell, 2021).
3rd strategy synopsis
Appropriate agriculture and rural development – enhancing rural and agricultural commerce
Appropriate agriculture and rural development meet economic, social, and cultural requirements without jeopardizing future generations. There needs to be an enhanced and diversified rural economy for improved agriculture and rural development.
Unrestricted and equitable trade
Unrestricted and fair trade benefits developing nations provided they possess the manpower, technology, and infrastructure to compete globally.
Income generation
Infrastructure development and transportation enhance market access, thereby increasing farmers' earnings. Promoting local goods leads to revenue growth.
Strategy recommendation
Enhancing market access and establishing robust transportation systems, roads, and communication channels are crucial for increased production and income generation.
Conclusion
Effective measures are necessary to boost income generation for economic satisfaction.
