Though mentoring is a fairly recent term in church circles, it has been widely practiced in Christian communities for years. Throughout many churches, spiritual guidance, leadership, discipleship, and companionship have been carried out in a mainly informal manner, highlighting the necessity to establish standard abilities and approaches for mentors to achieve better results. As per Mallison (1998), Christian guidance involves the growth of disciples and leaders through solid instructions and motivation, which are based on God’s will and biblical teachings. The writer defines Christian coaching as “a dynamic, deliberate relationship of confidence in which one individual empowers another to optimize the grace of God in their life and service” (Mallison, 1998, p. 8). The writer’s primary message is that mentorship is not discretionary if Christians aim to develop and the importance of showing concern in the advancement of others.
Faith-based mentoring combines different spiritual elements, facets, and the scripture as the chief components. By illustrating Jesus as the primary mentoring example, Mallison’s (1998) central argument is that Christians should be invested in the spiritual and personal maturation of others since Christianity is relational and collective. The writer underscores the ideas of fellowship and mutual dependence by portraying “a Christian desiring to exist in seclusion as a devout particle” (Mallison, 1998, p. 34). Nevertheless, the writer’s noteworthy contradiction is that despite incorporating all the crucial components and following the fundamental principles, Christian mentoring is ineffective if not underscored by a genuine eagerness to witness the mentor advance spiritually.
Guidance and cultivating an interest in the spiritual and personal growth of others are essential if Christians are interested in deepening their spirituality. For example, Christian congregations should assign responsible and trustworthy individuals to mentor new disciples due to their dependability and authentic care for the mentees’ progress (Mallison, 1998). One of the key implications of the publication is the vital importance of a properly organized and biblically motivated coaching scheme. This indicates that Christian mentorship models should produce disciples and leaders who would subsequently carry on spreading the gospel. Prominent criticisms in the book include the exclusive reliance on the scripture as the fountain of information for evaluation. Furthermore, there is a restricted examination of the bond of spiritual companions and the spiritual supervisors with the mentors and the absent opinions on mentor harm. The writer also reinforces his perspectives by making analogies from other writings and the extensive assimilation of biblical insights. A query that emerges from the publication is how the Christian framework of mentoring can rectify damaging coaching.
