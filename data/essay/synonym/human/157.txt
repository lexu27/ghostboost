In the contemporary era, the conservation of Confederate sculptures sparks numerous debates. As per the official political schedule endorsed by former President Donald Trump, these memorials are the historical emblems of the United States that ought to be safeguarded. Nevertheless, an increasing amount of proof backs the public sentiment that Confederate sculptures should be taken down as they intend to illustrate racial inequalities and the dominance of Whites. The primary argument of this assertion is upheld by the reality that the bulk of sculptures were erected not immediately after the Civil War but in the 1900s-1920s (Best, 2020). Throughout this period, various prejudicial regulations against Black people's civil rights were enforced.
The establishment of Confederate sculptures was funded by the United Daughters of the Confederacy. In the present time, it was perceived as a component of the union's enduring strategy that sought to fortify White supremacy and social injustices based on race. The association of sculptures with institutionalized racism is evident as the subsequent surge of Confederate sculptures' construction occurred in the 1920s-1940s, coinciding with "Black Americans' battling for civil rights and resisting widespread lynchings in the South" (Best, 2020, para. 4). Hence, Confederate sculptures sited across Southern states, notably on courthouse premises, aimed to exhibit the shielding of Whites by the law. The indisputable racial backdrop of sculptures' creation ultimately resulted in their elimination or displacement over the past few years in reaction to bias against Black inhabitants.
From an individual viewpoint, it is infeasible to reject that Confederate statues were directly linked with endeavors to reinforce White supremacy. That is why a substantial proportion of them might be taken away â€“ however, not all. In general, human history encompasses both favorable and adverse occurrences. Despite a considerable number of individuals opting to eradicate all remnants of tragic eras, they should be commemorated as well. In simpler terms, errors of the past should be recollected for their prevention in the future.
