In her groundbreaking work A Vindication of the Rights of Women, Mary Wollstonecraft asserts that schooling is an essential prerequisite for cultivating virtue or moral, just, and alternative ways of thinking and conduct. Wollstonecraft contends that acquiring and practicing one’s own rationale are the sole avenues to fostering virtue and females (Wollstonecraft 21). Nonetheless, unlike males, women during the author’s era were restricted in their ability to obtain education and had limited chances to broaden their perspectives. In this conviction, Wollstonecraft echoed Plato and his Allegory of the Cave. In this piece, the Greek thinker posits that one’s perceptions might vary from reality, and individuals who are deprived of gaining knowledge will never comprehend the actual world (Plato). Hence, Wollstonecraft maintains that women, on par with men, should be granted the privilege to education as it impacts them and the surrounding world.

In A Vindication of the Rights of Women, Mary Wollstonecraft insists that males and females are equal individuals and, thus, should be provided with the same entitlements and possibilities in life. The feminist author argues that, even though males and females are distinct in their essence, “their virtues should diverge relative to their nature” (Wollstonecraft 27). By stating this, Wollstonecraft holds males and females to identical ethical standards and denounces those who argue that a woman’s function in society should be confined to decorative purpose and childbearing. It can be contended that Wollstonecraft motivated the feminist movement, particularly, the individualist feminist tradition, that accentuates personal independence and individuality. Specifically, her resolute backing of women’s entitlement to education motivated many women to seek knowledge, enrich their understanding of the world, and become more virtuous.
