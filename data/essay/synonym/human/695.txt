Considering that autonomy signifies that no one can be penalized, having autonomy justifies some disciplinary practices and penalties. Consequently, the presence of autonomy is crucial for designating an individual as culpable and subsequent penalty. Often those who reject autonomy bear no accountability for their offenses. Autonomy signifies the duty to personalize actions, which also impacts decision-making. In such a scenario, the law enforcement officer's decision to detain typically violent and risky offenders will be validated, which will safeguard the remainder of society. Nonetheless, there is still no consensus on autonomy and accountability.

Causal indeterminism is the hypothesis that free actions do not need to be instigated by anything, nor do they possess any inherent causal framework. It asserts that free actions must be uncaused, while others acknowledge they can be caused by non-deterministically. The primary drawback of such a hypothesis is that the individual's fortune defends it (Pleasants, 2019). According to this rationale, if certain preceding events prompt action, it is not within the individual's control to execute it. Thus, according to this hypothesis, many individuals can rationalize their actions solely by coincidence while absolving themselves from accountability.

When discussing autonomy, one should also mention how it moves, specifically, about the soul. The human soul remains accountable for all executed actions since they have rationales for them. It is significantly more challenging to offer a precise explanation of the notion of the soul than of matter (Pleasants, 2019). Since antiquity, it has been believed that the physical covering of the soul, the human body, functions as matter, so we can readily define matter. We can depict the soul as the consciousness of matter, its psychological realm, accountable for it.
