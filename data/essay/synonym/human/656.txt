The worldwide pandemic has greatly impacted the usual lifestyle of individuals were accustomed to before the onset of the harmful virus. The study focuses on the psychological effects of the infection on learners in Saudi Arabia. Specifically, the authors sought to examine if the shift to a new way of life because of the pandemic has affected the stress levels of college students. 
Naturally, the investigators needed to provide practical examination to gather information to draw conclusions regarding the changes in stress levels among students. This is why Khoshaim et al. (2020) surveyed 400 students from various colleges on an online platform, inquiring about their mental condition and whether they observed any variations in their conduct or perception due to COVID-19. It is noteworthy to mention that surveys were distributed to the young individuals from March to June in 2020, which marks the peak of the pandemic globally (Khoshaim et al., 2020). Nonetheless, Khoshaim et al. (2020) deduced that 35% of the polled students were enduring moderate or severe stress, which significantly complicated their academic journey. On the whole, this study centers on a crucial subject, considering that students are still impacted by the transformations in global education as a consequence of COVID-19.
Regrettably, the outcomes of this study cannot be considered as dependable as the students could encounter stress due to various factors that could not be excluded in their responses to the online survey. Nevertheless, this piece of work establishes a strong basis for future investigations with more specific focuses that could explore the psychological challenges among the young population due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent limitations. Furthermore, the authorities can utilize the gathered information to aid students in alleviating their stress to boost their academic performance and well-being.
