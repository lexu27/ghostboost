The explanation of the HOPES (Homicide Outreach Project Empowering Survivors) as an essential tool for individuals who undergo this type of assault is accurate. Karmen suggests that victims have a profile and are likely to be attacked in the future if they do not establish a defense system (Karmen, 2020). Individuals in metropolitan areas and in proximity to them have a greater likelihood of encountering one type of violence such as theft or homicide when compared to individuals residing at a greater distance from these areas. Initiatives like HOPES offer these individuals with responses to troubling inquiries regarding why the incidents are more prevalent in their area. It is also crucial to evaluate the potential of these initiatives to demonstrate the security status of a specific location based on activities like drug trafficking and police presence. This data is vital in empowering potential victims to make rational choices regarding their living conditions and exposing them to different types of violence.
The author claims that the criminal justice system does not safeguard victims against potential recurring assaults. It is crucial to recognize that women are classified as rape victims in most cases. It should be highlighted that investigations like those conducted by Kopel in 1987 (Karmen, 2020) do not concentrate on male victims, revealing the defective nature of this system. While males constitute a segment of this demographic, they are not included in the data. It is also essential to acknowledge that black individuals are more susceptible to encountering any type of offense compared to their white counterparts (Karmen, 2020). Recognizing such details enables initiatives like HOPES to pinpoint specific communities and areas while offering assistance.
