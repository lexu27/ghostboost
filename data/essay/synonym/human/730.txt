Executive Overview
Toyota Motor Manufacturing UK should concentrate on the United Arab Emirates as its subsequent market. Following a macro-environment assessment, the nation has a stable environment, which is favorable to the organization. The nation has a stable government, an expanding economy, and a well-established infrastructure (Guéraiche, 2019). Moreover, due to the low joblessness rate in the UAE, a significant number of residents can afford a Corolla Hybrid model. Therefore, a collaboration, exportation, and foreign direct investment are all possibilities for the organization to penetrate the nation. Nonetheless, to lessen the potential risks linked with the entry strategies, the organization may wish to consider enhancing its research and placing more emphasis on the quality of its products.
Introduction
Toyota motor manufacturing in the UK is among the best-performing Toyota manufacturing facilities. The level of UK production has made Toyota a major participant in the nation's manufacturing sector, with most of its production being shipped abroad. The organization was established in 1989 to consolidate Toyota's market presence (Toyota Motor Manufacturing UK, 2022). It is situated in Derby and is part of the motor vehicle manufacturing sector. The organization hires over 2,725 workers and generates about $3 billion in revenue. One of the organization's core products is Corolla Hybrid because it provides exceptional value to the customers in the market (Germain Toyota of Columbus, 2022). Consequently, the rationale for entering the United Arab Emirates (UAE) is to achieve a competitive edge in the motor vehicle manufacturing sector.
Evaluation and Discussion
The Core Product of the Organization
Corolla Hybrid is the fundamental product of Toyota motor manufacturing situated in the UK. It is among the first version of Toyota Corolla's new model. The model integrates an award-winning compact sedan's proven formula with a hybrid powertrain (Germain Toyota of Columbus, 2022). This enables it to offer outstanding efficiency in the market. Additionally, the vehicle is equipped with features of a modern vehicle, such as a smart key system and Toyota safety sense. With these features, the vehicle will appeal to more purchasers.

PESTEL Analysis Model
PESTEL analysis model plays a crucial role in assessing the external environment of a business. The model has advantages and disadvantages that should be taken into account when evaluating a macro environment (Madsen and Grønseth, 2022). This aids organizations in identifying and examining the main factors that lead to changes in a strategic business environment. The tool also helps them respond to changes in the environment more effectively and efficiently. Conversely, the model does not offer crucial information, such as the level of competition in the environment. Despite the challenges, the PESTEL model is vital in comprehending the macro environment of an organization.
Political Factors
The UAE is a constitutional federation and among the most stable governments in the Middle East. It consists of Abu Dhabi, Ajman, Dubai, Fujairah, Ras Al Khaimah, Sharjah, and Umm Al Quwain (Guéraiche, 2019). Each of these emirates is governed by a leader, while the Federal Supreme Council, the UAE's supreme constitutional body, comprises all seven leaders. Abu Dhabi serves as the UAE's capital and operational center for most government activities. The UAE is a significant player in the Middle East and exerts considerable influence on a global scale (Guéraiche, 2019). It maintains strong diplomatic and commercial relations with the US, Saudi Arabia, India, China, and other nations worldwide. Based on this, Toyota motor manufacturing UK can effectively operate in this setting.
Economic Factors
The economic environment is a critical aspect of analyzing the UAE. The nation is a part of economic and political groups. Firstly, it is the world's 29th-largest economy. Its GDP is projected to surpass $400 billion in 2022. (Hammour and Mckeown, 2022). Petroleum, gold, and diamonds are among the primary commodities the UAE exports. India, Japan, China, Oman, and Switzerland are the top destinations for exporting products. Most of its imports consist of major goods, such as automobiles, from China, India, Germany, the UK, and Turkey. This indicates that Toyota manufacturing UK can easily find a market for its Corolla Hybrid. The organization is likely to benefit from the nation's economic performance.
The UAE is among the wealthiest nations globally in terms of per capita income. Over the years, it has made substantial economic strides due to its abundant natural resources, economic diversification, innovation, and inflows of foreign direct investments (Facchini, Jaeck, and Bouhaddioui, 2021). Furthermore, it has diversified into various industries, such as tourism and real estate development, which aid in maintaining its status as one of the wealthiest nations globally. Nevertheless, the organization's excessive dependence on the petroleum sector is a weakness. This suggests that the nation's economy could decline if petroleum diminishes. Consequently, despite its reliance on petroleum being risky, the UAE's economy is stable and offers a favorable environment for foreign firms to operate effectively.
Social Factors
The United Arab Emirates is among the most liberal nations in the region. Dubai, in particular, is a flourishing international business hub and a highly dynamic emirate (Schilirò, 2021). It is technologically advanced and well-connected to the rest of the world. The UAE's population is estimated to be approximately nine million individuals. Emirati nationals represent around 20% of the total population, making the nation one of the most immigrant-rich globally (Abaido, 2020, p.350). As a result, the UAE is home to individuals from diverse cultures and nations, making it one of the world's most cosmopolitan cities. The organization's leaders can be confident of a conducive environment to conduct their research and operations.
Emirati society is characterized by opulent lifestyles, where owning luxurious goods reflects an individual's identity, social image, and social standing. Personal purchase decisions are influenced by family members and peers. The number of Emiratis pursuing higher education continues to rise (Ashour, 2020). Expat workers play a significant role in the UAE's national identity and social demographics. For instance, foreign workers make up a substantial portion of the UAE's national workforce, leading to imbalanced population demographics. The nation attracts individuals from across the globe, making it a business hub. More vehicles will be needed to transport people to various destinations. Consequently, labor markets are likely to face new regulations to restore national identity.
Technological Factors
Technological factors play a crucial role in business operations in the UAE. The UAE's population is tech-savvy, enabling organizations to leverage technology (Aminova, Mareef, and Machado, 2020). This indicates that an organization can utilize technological operations, particularly in marketing its products. For instance, a majority of Emiratis use social media, making it easier for an organization to reach them. Moreover, the government has heavily invested in ICT, providing a solid platform for modern organizations. Organizations can access internet services and utilize existing infrastructure to support their operations. Consequently, the UAE's technological environment is effective in supporting the activities of contemporary businesses.
