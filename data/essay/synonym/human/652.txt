Preamble
A substantial portion of various communities is structured and managed based on a collection of regulations, principles, integrity, and statutes. Interestingly, as early civilizations progressed, they relied on regulations and principles to uphold harmony across the realm. The Codex of Hammurabi, inscribed on obelisk and clay tablets, was the earliest documented system of statutes, comprising of 282 enshrined regulations. The compilation of laws was promulgated by Hammurabi (r. 1795-1750 BCE), the Babylonian ruler who conquered and subsequently governed ancient Mesopotamia. The regulations are believed to have had a notable influence on the existence of Babylonians, ranging from political significance, ensuring impartiality, economic importance, as well as family and penal legislation.
Equity and Affluence
The regulations have served as a motivation for establishing equity in diverse civilizations. Hammurabi held a comprehensive perspective on equity for all individuals. Concluding The Codex, he declared, "The great deities have summoned me, and I am indeed a shepherd who is bringing tranquility and whose authority is righteous." When intending to guide future leaders, The Codex proclaims in the conclusion: May the leader chosen in the region scrutinize the fair statements I have inscribed on my monument for an extended period. As a component of the notion of equity, Hammurabi also affirms that he would shield the defenseless against injustice by the powerful.
As part of his concept of parity and equity, affluence is addressed. When Hammurabi proclaims that he has bestowed "prosperity to the populace forever," he is referring to well-being concerning economic affluence and the welfare of his populace. Nevertheless, considering the emphasis placed on personal possession, agreements, incomes, and markets, it can be contended that Hammurabi was concerned about the economic predicaments of the Babylonians. Consequently, Hammurabi aimed to establish an institutional framework suitable for economic expansion by prioritizing affluence alongside equity.
Acknowledgement of Economic Agents
Agriculture and international commerce were the primary activities in Hammurabi's realm. The Codex pertains to traders operating through an intermediary in international trade rather than directly. The traders carried out specific duties of banking in the Babylonian economic structure. One aspect of banking involves receiving deposits and acting as guardians of these funds. For instance, to deposit valuable items like silver and gold, The Codex mandates that an agreement be documented in the presence of witnesses. As per statute 122 of The Codex, if a man intends to entrust gold or silver to another for safekeeping, he must present whatever he provides before witnesses. Akin to the contemporary legal system, The Codex establishes the requirement of witnesses and impartial judges. The statute makes it evident that a valid claim cannot be made without an accord or a witness.
Acknowledgement of Personal Possession
Consequently, The Codex acknowledges individual ownership in terms of land and personal possessions. Without laws on private property and their enforcement, the Babylonian economy, with its intermediaries, traders, and landholder-farmers, could not function. Offenses against property rights carried severe penalties, including capital punishment. According to Law six, if a man purloins something belonging to a divinity or a realm, he must face the death penalty, as must anyone who receives the stolen items from him. The law does not differentiate between an unwitting recipient of stolen goods and a knowing recipient of stolen property. Capital punishment is decreed for both the transgressor and the recipients of stolen items.
Enslaved individuals were deemed property under The Codex, and the privileges of enslavers were rigorously enforced. Law 15 stipulates that if a man allows an enslaved person or female slave from a palace to abscond, he must face capital punishment. Babylonian society viewed burglary attempts as a serious transgression. According to Law 21, if a man breaks into a dwelling, he must be executed and hanged. Additionally, firefighters who endeavored to appropriate the possessions of fire victims were also subject to capital punishment. According to Law 25, if a fire erupts in a man's abode and the individual who goes to extinguish it takes an item from the residence, that individual must be cast into the flames. Thus, it is evident that The Codex regarded violations of property rights seriously and penalized them with the death penalty in most instances. Hammurabi's Codex establishes specific penalties for different offenses, similar to contemporary laws.
Legitimacy of Agreements
The Codex and various clay tablets and obelisks from the period of Hammurabi demonstrate that no transaction was deemed lawful without a documented pact. Once the contract was endorsed, all parties were obliged to adhere to its stipulations. Any breach was liable to severe consequences or sanctions. According to Law 36, a chieftain's land, garden, and residence cannot be traded. These are akin to feudal estates as they are bestowed by the monarch in return for royal service and thus are permanent in that they cannot be sold. Should someone acquire these properties, they will incur a financial loss. According to Law 37, if a man acquires the field, plantation, or home of a messenger, his transaction is annulled, and he forfeits his money; the field and plantation. Stringent terms of agreement govern the relationship between the landowner and the tenants.
Economic Value of Offspring
The Codex emphasizes the economic value of progeny. The Codex presupposes that matrimony is for the purpose of procreation. This is evident when The Codex permits a man to marry another woman if his primary wife is infertile. It was common for a childless wife to acquire a slave-girl for the husband to sire children. Law 145 states that if a man has wedded a woman and she fails to bear him sons, he must marry a slave-girl and admit her into his abode. Law 147 elucidates the role of the slave-girl in bearing sons. The law stipulates that if she fails to bear sons, the man's primary wife may sell her. Offspring were intended to possess economic value, given the predominance of agriculture in the Babylonian economy. For elite landowners, sons were likely sought not for their labor but for their assistance in managing the estate and subsequently as heirs to the inheritance.
Principle of Impartiality
The Codex places emphasis on equity as well as equitable pricing. Law 108 serves as an instance of the equity principle. The law states that if a female brewer refuses to accept grain in exchange for ale but accepts silver by weight, they must convict her and cast her into the water. The Codex anticipates that farmers would be cash-strapped between sowing and harvesting but will have significant leisure time to spend at the tavern. Additionally, as mentioned in the Preamble, The Codex ensures that the mighty do not exploit the feeble. This is evident in how it establishes compensation obligations for individuals who suffer losses, orphans, and widows.
Upon the demise of her husband, the widow is entitled to the dowry and any arrangements he made for her. Law 171 mandates the primary wife to retain her bridal gift and the provisions her husband apportioned to her in writing on a tablet and dwell in her husband's
