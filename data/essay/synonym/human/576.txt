In Emily Dickinson’s poem “Hope Is the Thing with Feathers” one can observe the fervent, profoundly emotional, skillful nature of the writer. During the years of her labor, there was a Civil War between the middle-class North and the enslaving South of America. Quiet Amherst, where Emily Dickinson resided, appeared to be detached from these occurrences, but even in it they grieved for their deceased sons. This reality undoubtedly also impacted the work of Emily Dickinson, and it is within it that the societal importance of the poem “Hope Is the Thing with Feathers” is mirrored.
The poem is dominated by the vowel sound [i], the hissing silent consonant [s], the resonant consonants [l], [m]. The vowel sound [i] is connected with azure, jade – these are the shades of illumination, happiness, and calmness: “I’ve heard it in the coldest land” (Dickinson 1). Simultaneously, the affirmative portrayal of “coldest land” is a metaphor which signifies the North grappling with the enslavement system. Voiceless consonant sounds are linked with whispering, commotion, and somber tones: “sore must be the tempest” (Dickinson 1). Consequently, in the imagination, there is a depiction of the clash of two tones, the conflict of somber and bright hues (Parker 22). This conflict, which is evident in the poem even at the phonetic level, mirrors the conflict of the northern and southern regions.
The wording of the poem alternates rising and falling tones. The ascent transpires in terms conveying hope for the downfall of the enslaving society (“Hope”, “And sweetest”) (Dickinson 1). The text culminates with an ascending tone: the terms “of Me” resonate with heightened emotionality (Dickinson 1). The ascending tone intertwines with the descending one in the poem, conveying the fluctuations, sentiments, and emotions of the lyrical protagonist. The oscillation of rising and falling tones in the poem conveys the mood of the battle against the enslaving society.
The pivotal imageries of the poem are: hope, soul, gust, tempest, bird, extremity. These terms delineate the interaction of the central imagery of the poem (“hope”) and the lyrical protagonist with the environment (Dickinson 1). “Hope” in this poem is personal, something alive in the spirit of an individual:
“Hope” is the thing with feathers / That perches in the soul (Dickinson 1).
A bird with feathers is a customary symbol of liberty. By incorporating wings to the depiction of hope, the writer demonstrates the significance of the aftermath of a large-scale event – the conflict between the North and the South – for each individual, for the liberty of a person.
Verbs that shape the imagery of hope are in the present tense and convey the continuity of action, persistence (“perches”, “sings”, “never stops”) of the struggle (Dickinson 1). Since the confrontation between an enslaving and a liberated society has persisted for centuries, combined with the adverb “never”, the verb indicates the constancy of action. The central term “hope” acquires in the text a connotation linked with persistence, through which the motive of confrontation, scattered battle is discerned. The poem employs terms that indicate space, natural phenomena: “gust”, “tempest”, “strangest sea”, “extremity” (Dickinson 1). These terms are related to peril, apprehension, and anguish. An illustration of the hostile surrounding world is crafted, a similar sentiment is transferred to the lyrical protagonist, to the central imagery of the poem. In this manner, the atmosphere of tension that exists at the juncture of the division of American society into two parts is conveyed.
Consequently, “Hope Is the Thing with Feathers” is a socially significant poem, as the image of hope in the guise of a small timid bird conveys the worldview of thousands of Americans in a challenging historical era. Emily Dickinson succeeded in accurately portraying the state of many citizens at a crucial moment in the conflict of the North with the enslaving South.
