Numerous approaches are implemented to compare the function of intervention with other vocations. The methodologies consist of the interest-based techniques, grounded in the field of mediation, generalist intervention model applied in the social work field, and traditional adversarial approach, utilized in the legal field. Consequently, the document will thoroughly elaborate on the shift of roles based on this professional premise regarding skills, methods, and tactics when transitioning from one occupation to another in the intervention as a conflict arises among different parties on a large scale. 

Three occupations are contrasted, encompassing mediation, social work, and law. To illustrate these similarities, I employ an interest-based scheme of mediation, a generalist scheme of social work, and a traditional adversarial legal scheme. It is worth noting that other legal and social work practitioners view mediation as a potential role for them to undertake. Substantial variances emerge when comparing the orientations, principles, and methodologies of the three schemes as stipulated by (Barsky 2017). A lawyer's traditional role is that of an advocate who champions for the rights and concerns of one party in a conflict. The majority of social workers are accustomed to advocating for specific clients or causes. Attorneys or social service experts aspiring to undertake the role of a mediator must set aside their advocacy and become impartial facilitators. Clients can engage mediators to negotiate on their behalf. 

Moreover, mediators bolster each party's capacity to negotiate; they do not endorse a specific situation or resolution. When advocacy-focused aiding professionals transition into mediators, one of the most challenging adaptations is to remain unbiased. Each of the three vocations underscores the customers' entitlement to make their own decisions concerning principles. They uphold individualism and each individual's self-esteem. Due to courts imposing resolutions on parties, some individuals perceive the legal system as contrary to self-determination. Even for attorneys, however, resorting to the courtroom is a final measure. Disagreements are most effectively resolved through direct negotiations between parties or attorney-mediated discussions (Barsky, 2017). Only when the parties are incapable of independently reaching a consensus, do they resort to the legal system for assistance. 

Nonetheless, in a scenario where a conflict emerges between two parties, such as the employer and employee, founded on the interest-based technique from mediation, as a mediator, the task would involve attentively listening to the information disclosed by both parties entirely. Conversely, as a mediator, I would listen to both parties equitably, thereby upholding impartiality to adhere to the professional standards. Once all the information is disclosed as the mediator, I would meticulously scrutinize the issue at hand from all angles and ensure that the parties comprehend the matter and do not arrive at an agreement (Barsky, 2017). 

As a result, a shift to the generalist intervention model based on social work is made where the mutual understanding of the parties is embraced, allowing the core issue to be comprehended by both parties to ultimately resolve the matter. Therefore, if both approaches prove ineffective, I would resort to the final method of the traditional adversarial legal model where each party would need representatives to advocate for them in court in cases of no mutual agreement on the court's decision (Barsky, 2017). Additionally, the attorney must receive instructions from the individual they represent on how to proceed and, more importantly, react to the issue at hand. Conversely, intervention is aimed at establishing a connection between the disputing parties regarding the conflicting matter at hand.
