The article emphasized various rationales why women opted to be child-free. These consist of the wish to excel from an academic and professional viewpoint, financial rationales, a lack of inherent desires, and the realization that a child would not enhance their life but rather complicate it (Sandler).
There were a couple of things that I cannot wholly concur with. The decision of a woman to be in a serious relationship with a man with a 15-year-old daughter without assuming even minimal parental responsibilities seems thoughtless for the young girl both from the viewpoint of the childfree woman and the father who acknowledges such conditions. Furthermore, the assertion that women are not more pressured into having children due to the possibilities does not align with the prior norms in which women who did not wed and have children had almost no opportunities in society.
Based on the materials I have perused, I would say that being child-free is a decision that everyone can make depending on the life objectives and aspirations of the individual. On one hand, a woman may be content building a sturdy career and not possess any inclination to make changes for a child, which renders it impractical to have one unless love and care can be bestowed. On the other hand, the majority of women are still opting to have children notwithstanding the potential challenges that coincide with motherhood, encompassing financial, professional, and social predicaments. Nevertheless, since every woman is distinct and residing in a contemporary world entails being capable of making a decision, having or not having children is an individual choice that every person is to make based on their own life encounters and perspectives.
