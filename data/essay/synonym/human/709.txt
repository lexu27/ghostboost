The primary subject of conversation is the Supreme Court's revocation of vaccines and weekly examinations in opposition to the coronavirus requirement for enterprises. According to the requirement, OSHA would become the governing body for adherence to the regulation at any business with over 100 workers. Despite the severe coronavirus circumstance, the Supreme Court acknowledged that OSHA overstepped its jurisdiction since the authority to conform to such a requirement should stay with the employer.
One perspective is that the COVID situation is deteriorating, and the requirement was a rational extension of Biden's strategy to combat the coronavirus. As per CNBC's assessment of Johns Hopkins University information, over 731,000 fresh daily infections were recorded in seven days, which is 4% higher than the preceding week (Kimball, 2022; January 25, para. 11). Nevertheless, during the debate, the perspective was articulated that the determination to adhere to the requirement should not be obligatory but should remain with the employer.
The key contention is that such actions are overly extreme, and the perspective of the disease instances is not fully considered. The Supreme Court also concurs with this viewpoint, which concluded that ETS exceeded the regulation of workplace safety and entered the realm of extensive public health actions (Bickel et al., 2022). The court also clarified that coronavirus infection was classified as a general risk ailment and could be likened to the risk of everyday hazards, which has no connection to the worker's workplace (Bickel et al., 2022). The ultimate argument against the introduction of the requirement may be that OSHA did not possess adequate historical experience to conduct such a wide-ranging experiment. This results in the rational inference that the court's ruling and the perspective articulated in the conversation are entirely justified and possess significantly more adverse aspects than it appears initially.
