Ethical and Unethical Use of Private Informants
Law enforcement and crime prevention are highly complex tasks carried out by policing units globally. The missions aim at identifying criminal transactions and preventing them before they turn into criminal acts. Lauchs (2019) observes that nearly all illicit activities conducted by gangs or terrorist organizations involve extensive planning, thus permitting the utilization of covert informants. The "informants" operate by feigning to be part of felonious groups while covertly reporting the proceedings to law enforcement agencies such as the FBI (Hällgren et al., 2021). The approach raises significant moral concerns, impacting regulatory goals.
The favorable aspect of employing secretive informants includes cost savings, community cooperation, and reliable firsthand evidence (Fiorelli, 2020). However, issues such as informants exploiting their role to gain money render the approach unethical (Fiorelli, 2020). Hällgren et al. (2021) assert that most informants have a criminal background, which they discreetly extend while acting as covert spies. Thus, the unethical issues related to informants portray the use of secretive insiders as a means of encouraging crimes rather than combating them.
Advantages of Covert Informants
Confidential informants work for anti-crime agencies by participating in illegal schemes orchestrated by real criminals. The spies' capacity to obtain firsthand evidence from the apparent wrongdoers renders the approach highly reliable for the agencies. Consequently, utilizing "informers" to probe misconduct offers substantial advantages despite various concerns. For instance, informants provide a cost-efficient strategy for countering crimes. Bunin (2019) explains that most U.S. informants receive allowances based on the quality of the information they provide. This makes the process less expensive compared to the costly devices and tactics sometimes needed to gather evidence. Additionally, a significant number of informants in the U.S. face other charges. These individuals' incentives involve leniency during their legal proceedings, rendering the approach highly cost-effective.
Drawbacks of Employing Covert Informants
Using undercover spies often fosters injustice and criminal activities instead of deterring them. Many betrayers in the U.S. do not act honestly, thus significantly compromising the justice system. Corruption among officers and racism issues also contribute to undermining the quest for justice through clandestine informants (Hällgren et al., 2021). The case of Randell Adams provides substantial evidence of the disadvantages of confidential informants. He nearly faced execution in the 1980s due to false statements, some originating from untrustworthy tattlers collaborating with the police to secure unlawful benefits. Seeking a ride from Harris made Adams a suspect in falsely confessing to the murder of Mr. Woods, a police officer. Harris killed the officer and fled in the stolen car that had earlier transported Adams. After being apprehended, Harris initially denied knowledge of the murder but altered his stance after Woods' colleague linked the vehicle to the crime.
Harris claimed to have been present at the scene and witnessed the officer's killing by a hitchhiker, Mr. Adams. The state of Texas's inclination to execute offenders played a pivotal role in altering the course of events ("Thin Blue Line' prisoner executed in Texas," 2004). Harris was sixteen years old and therefore ineligible for execution as per Texas laws. Adams was twenty-seven and a minority, and the murder of an officer warranted execution (Sorensen & Pilgrim, 2021).
The situation prompted the prosecution team to enlist secret informants like Emily Miller, whose child's robbery charges were dropped as a reward for testifying as a witness. Other false witnesses also linked Adams to the murder. Additionally, psychology experts such as Dr. James Grigson reiterated that Mr. Adams was dangerous and execution was the most appropriate course of action (Sorensen & Pilgrim, 2021). The fabricated testimonies from various confidential informants influenced the judge to sentence Mr. Adams to death, only for him to be spared three days before the scheduled execution.
