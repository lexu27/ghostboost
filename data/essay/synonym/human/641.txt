The Alabama State charter aims to offer and safeguard a broad range of citizens’ rights. Particularly, some of these rights are duplicated in the American Bill of Rights. Similar to the American Bill of Rights, the Alabama State charter is equally comprehensive and contains various sections that are devoted to enriching and safeguarding citizens’ freedoms. The noteworthy aspect within the Alabama State charter concerning the safeguarding of rights is the freedom of speech. Within the Bill of Rights, The First Amendment shields the citizens’ freedom of speech as it allows them to not only communicate through speech but also through protest groups (Weinberger, 2019). The Alabama State charter reflects a similar viewpoint as Section 4 prohibits the creation of any laws that would restrict the citizens’ freedom of speech. In this regard, the Alabama State charter upholds the Bill of Rights and underscores the protection of the freedom of speech for the populace. Both the Fourteenth Amendment and Equal Rights Amendment address a similar concept of discrimination. On one side, the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified to prevent former slaves from discrimination. Consequently, black individuals who had been previously enslaved were granted equality before the law (Young, 2018). Conversely, the Equal Rights Amendment is an extension of the Fourteenth Amendment as it ensures equal treatment of all American citizens regardless of their gender. During its drafting, women were frequently regarded as second-class citizens and were confronted with numerous legal limitations (Bleiweis, 2020). Hence, while both the Fourteenth Amendment and Equal Rights Amendment were formulated to combat discrimination, their range of application in relation to the individuals they encompassed varied as they were based on race and gender, respectively.
