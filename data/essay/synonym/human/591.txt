Despite the architectural potency or scope of concentration in a team, there is still a requirement for adequate supervisory backing. According to Savu (2019), team triumph hinges on its capacity to adopt collaboration, capable team leadership, and proper inspiration. A research study investigated the correlation between managerial backing and work performance and discovered a strong connection (Wassem et al., 2019). They deduced that managerial support resulted in a significant escalation in employee retention and productivity (Wassem et al., 2019). The document will concentrate on a local football team and examine managerial communication and team leadership dynamics and their ensuing impacts on the players’ success. Mr. Albert's managerial backing led to the triumph of the Eagles United Soccer Club by revamping the team and concentrating on the individual weaknesses and strengths of each player while offering guidance on enhancement.
Eagles United Soccer Club is a football team and its primary aim is to offer a platform for nurturing and exhibiting soccer talents through cultivating a competitive sports culture. The team’s ultimate aim is to be the foremost and most prosperous men’s football team in Atlanta. The club was founded on the 29th of January 2017 and has been in operation for the past five years. The team consists of two boards of directors, three personnel (the club supervisor, the assistant club supervisor, and the club training supervisor), and twenty-five football players. Sports board members play a crucial role in evaluating the risk management procedures, examining the financial aspects, and in selecting the CEO and managers (Cheng et al., 2021).
In the Eagles club, the board members also provided a sense of overall guidance and strategy. The team supervisor and assistant team supervisor furnish the suitable leadership, training, and motivation required for the team’s success. The team also had a coach and dietitian whose duties were to steer the players in enhancing their physical strength and agility. Musculoskeletal injuries and wounds are quite prevalent among football players and lead to a substantial loss of time (Rollo et al., 2020). Hence, the coach and the dietitian also assisted players through injury recovery and recuperation.
During the initial year, Mr. Jones, one of the two Directors, was the team supervisor. Mr. Jones took on the role automatically to fill the gap as an interim supervisor while the board searched for a permanent replacement. Interim management is a tactic frequently utilized for a temporary period as the leadership addresses a technical, financial, or managerial challenge (Kisi, 2020). Additionally, interim management is an extremely flexible, radical, and adaptive leadership approach (Kisi, 2020). Mr. Jones was charismatic, highly concentrated, result-driven, conscientious, and assertive. His competent leadership and effective communication laid a solid groundwork for the team. At the commencement of the second year, Mr. Albert was appointed as the new club supervisor, with a six-month trial period. Later on, he was elevated to the position of permanent club supervisor following his success in the role. He highly esteemed autonomy and feedback in his communication style.
The primary and foremost duty of the team upon Mr. Albert's arrival as the club supervisor was to secure a major trophy within two years with the existing squad of twenty-five football players. The club supervisor commenced by reorganizing the team and having every team member establish their personal objectives. The club supervisor efficiently settled any conflicts between and among the team members. He largely approached conflict with an active-constructive approach, where he emphasized a win-win result in every conflict. Gilbert & Kelloway (2018) observed that leaders who employed the active-constructive approach bolstered better performance and sacrifices among the employees. Additionally, the club supervisor was an exceptional communicator, paying attention to detail in both verbal and nonverbal communication. Whenever anyone approached him with any issue, he would listen and closely observe the body language while providing suitable gestures, facial expressions, and feedback where necessary.
Moreover, the team supervisor clearly defined and delegated roles to each team member, articulating the expectations of each assigned task. He provided precise and timely information to all the team members, and he valued immediate feedback. Furthermore, he was very principled and resolute in his decisions. For example, he proposed that one of the midfielders transition to a striker, having recognized the individual’s finishing skills. Initially, the player was opposed to the change, but through effective communication involving prompt feedback, they reached an agreement. The team clinched two major trophies during the second and third seasons with Mr. Albert as the team supervisor, thereby accomplishing our primary objective as a team before he voluntarily departed the club at the conclusion of the third season. Mr. Albert was an efficient team supervisor who utilized his leadership and communication skills to deliver team success. He was the best individual for the team supervisor role.
Constructed, managed, and suitably facilitated, teams have the potential to give an organization a competitive advantage. Team success necessitates an effective leader characterized by: properly executed managerial communication; and attention to detail in both verbal and nonverbal communication combined with immediate feedback. A good team supervisor plays a central role in empowering, motivating, and guiding team members toward achieving a common goal. Furthermore, it is crucial to note that team success also requires the collaboration of team members.
