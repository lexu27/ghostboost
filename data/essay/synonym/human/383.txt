Kantian morals are the most transparent illustration of non-consequential theories in philosophy, and correspondingly, in law. Advocates of essential social order concepts such as utilitarianism often back this viewpoint. In Kant’s philosophy, the notions of non-consequential ethics are most vividly exemplified by the moral and ethical phenomenon he devised and termed the categorical imperative.
This notion, as envisioned by Kant, is the articulation of how an individual should behave, striving to engage in authentically moral conduct (Kant & Abbott, 2021). The imperative directly speaks to the acting individual, who makes specific moral decisions based on the predetermined rational methods. It counsels an individual to rigorously and urgently, most carefully, handle the maxims of their conduct, specifically the subjective regulations of practical reason. According to Kant, the principles of pure practical reason take on a distinct non-consequential structure (Kant & Abbott, 2021). They are declarations encompassing a general definition of will, which is bound by numerous practical regulations; this concept poses specific challenges in the core of the declaration.
It needs to be explored how Kant comprehends ethics in more detail. Namely, morality should not be subjective, restricted by personal interests, but absolute and universal; otherwise, it is nonexistent (Kant & Abbott, 2021). In simpler terms, relativism is the adversary of authentic morality, the dependency on principles, and conformity to the circumstance. In this facet of Kant’s philosophy, the clash between the fundamental, rigorously required, universal moral law, which Kant upholds, and the constantly definite circumstances, the activities of particular individuals, takes on a notably acute shape. This conflict surfaces at the forefront of Kant’s non-consequential ethical stance. In the end, a specific individual cannot exist and operate in any other way than by focusing on circumstances, establishing their own subjective maxims of conduct. Maybe they have no rationale to be steered by universal morality, and in this scenario, the universal moral law–the categorical imperative–turns into merely an idea and a figment.
