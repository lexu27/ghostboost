Performance is not simply the creation of musical sounds, but the interaction of the musician and the audience through all mediums, including visual ones. It is no coincidence that at the performance the musician is on a platform in front of everyone. During the performance, not only the musician’s capability to produce musical sounds is evaluated, but also the musicians’ capability to carry out intricate interaction between them and the audience. The way musicians attire themselves for a performance conveys a lot about their approach towards the audience. Listeners show admiration for the musician by maintaining their focus and quietness while the music is playing, and afterward, they clap or express gratitude verbally. Musicians show admiration for the listener by executing music diligently and faithfully, and create a feeling of the uniqueness of the occasion at the performance with their attire and stage manner. The musician’s wardrobe also impacts the perception of the performance, and it is crucial for performers not just of popular music, but also of classical music. Although, as per Epstein, instrumental music is an art form that is wholly devoted to what is heard, the appearance of the musician is immensely important. Therefore, those who perform in a symphony orchestra always adhere to a strict dress code. Attire for a performance is a critical aspect that necessitates special attention and consideration. An artist’s performance outfit should not just be sophisticated and suitable for the performance setting, but it should also be comfortable so that nothing hinders the performance. However, amid classical music performers, there are also enthusiasts of casual attire, for instance, violinist Vanessa Mae and cellist Nigel Kennedy. Diverse listeners interpret the unique appearance of a musician differently: some view it as merely a marketing ploy, while others perceive it as a craving for innovation.
