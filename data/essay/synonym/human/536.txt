The Transformation by Franz Kafka is an excellent tale about a young man who changes into a beetle and is confined in his own room due to fruits hurled at him sticking in his shell. Georg Samka awakens in a surreal dream world, and he receives no compassion from anyone, despite the fact that he has given up his own dreams for years so that his sister might study music at the Conservatory. His family members' responses to him and how they opt to handle the situation reveal their connections with him, unveiling their true feelings about the young man.
While Gregor's family has never displayed affection for him, they did at least regard him as a person before his metamorphosis; following his metamorphosis, they have become increasingly cruel and distant. Gregor's family endures him before his metamorphosis as he assumes the role of the family's provider. They don't have a particularly affectionate bond, but at least they show him some regard so that he can continue to sustain them. When they suspect he will be late for work, they double-check to ensure he arrives. When his father tries to rouse his son, even if he is not working, he issues a caution in his tone.
His sister is the only one of his family that comes to his aid, asking if he is unwell. She promptly tries to comfort and aid him in any way she can. Grete, the sister, begins gathering items that she believes he will enjoy after his metamorphosis so that he can eat and feel at ease, such as decaying vegetables, cheese, old leftovers, and hardened bones. Mrs. Samsa, his mother, is distressed by the change, overwhelmed with sentiment and anguish. She does her utmost to console and aid him, but she cannot bear to look at him. She strives to act motherly in her sorrow, but she struggles to overcome his appearance. Mr. Samsa, Gregor's father, is disagreeable and impolite to the extent of turning abusive. Mr. Samsa has grown accustomed to Gregor supporting his family by laboring and financing their survival. He is infuriated by the change, particularly as it means Gregor will no longer be able to provide for them.
All the family members began to mistreat him following his metamorphosis. His father drives him back into the room with a publication. Gregor's father subsequently harms him by hurling a piece of fruit at him, resulting in an illness. As Gregor can no longer work, his parents and sister have all taken on roles to supplement his earnings. Grete, too, gradually loses compassion for her brother. She was likely his closest family member, yet tending to him becomes a burden for her. Eventually, she informs her parents that she desires Gregor removed. He realizes that the most beneficial thing he can do for them is to perish, and he does so.
In conclusion, Gregor's metamorphosis mirrors a genuine response from his family members towards him. Through the transformation, Gregor demonstrates that he harbored a desire to be liberated from the obligations that should have been his father's, his aversion to his occupation, and the monotony that accompanies it. His metamorphosis illustrates Gregor's resentment towards his family's exploitation of him and their negligence in contributing to the family's finances.
