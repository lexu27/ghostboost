The healthcare system is presently under considerable pressure due to the COVID 19 pandemic. The challenges of provision and staff shortages in healthcare have existed previously but have now deteriorated. Specifically, the problem of scarcity of medical provisions is evident in the outpatient surgical environment where I work. This issue is directly linked to the existing principles of constructing supply chains in healthcare, which should be open to change. In this scenario, John’s Kotter intervenes in leading change can serve as a framework for yielding positive outcomes.
The primary benefit of this theory is the comprehensive approach to effecting changes. Most notably, Kotter’s theory comprises eight steps that are rooted in the development and transmission of a vision for the necessity of change (Beauvais & Spahn, 2018). Furthermore, this theory is highly beneficial as it enables innovation to be introduced at a structural rather than purely organizational level. Concerning the aforementioned issue, this element is the most crucial. Eight steps proposed by Kotter that could aid in the successful execution of changes are detailed below.
 1. The initial step is to establish a sense of urgency for change. Kotter observes that it necessitates around 75% of advocates to effectively instill a sense of urgency (Beauvais & Spahn, 2018, p. 255). This can be accomplished through dialogues with other nurses and presenting data on how the scarcity of provisions adversely impacts the quality of care and patient outcomes.
 2. Successful execution of change necessitates forming a coalition through the practice of proficient leadership. On this matter, you must collaborate with representatives from other healthcare divisions and organizations to recruit more advocates. At this phase, it is crucial to identify influential associates who could bring the issue to public attention.
 3. At this phase, it is imperative to develop a vision and a corresponding strategy. Particularly, it is crucial to furnish individuals not solely with proof of the existence of the problem and its repercussions but also to specify the overarching objective of changes. Additionally, it is essential to articulate how modifications in supply chains, along with an emphasis on planning and forecasting, can make a substantial difference.
 4. Subsequently, it is vital to convey the vision, for which it is essential to seize every opportunity. Structural changes are imperative concerning the issue, which complicates the process of implementing changes. At this juncture, it is pivotal to articulate the vision not solely among colleagues but also within the medical community as a whole. This will aid in broadening the awareness of the issue as well as securing advocates.
 5. An essential aspect for a leader is also to encourage action and eliminate obstacles to change. Specifically, the ambitions of nurses and their proactive efforts to implement the strategy must be endorsed and motivated. It is also crucial to pinpoint those who resist change and endeavor to persuade them of its necessity.
 6. For effective execution, it is also necessary to attain short-term outcomes, which will serve as an indicator of the feasibility of change. As part of addressing the issue, even extending the awareness of its existence can be a triumph. To effectively tackle an issue, it is crucial that organizations acknowledge the necessity for long-term supply planning.
 7. Following each minor triumph within the strategy, it is crucial to evaluate the outcomes and adapt the plan. It is critical for a leader to contemplate what possibilities for change in supply management are available and how they can be efficiently utilized.
Ultimately, it is essential to embed the change in the organizational culture. Concerning the issue, this should be carried out at the structural level through upholding awareness and active deliberation of supply management change initiatives.
