In this investigation, the scientists employed various linear regression to recognize the correlation between alcohol intake and the features of the vicinity. The reliant variable for this research is alcohol intake among students (Freitas et al., 2020). The analysis consists of five autonomous variables; firstly, is individuals often get mugged, robbed, or assaulted in the vicinity. Secondly, individuals in my vicinity watch out for each other and thirdly, individuals vend or used drugs in the vicinity. Fourthly, individuals in my vicinity usually got along with each other, and lastly, I feel secure being out alone in my vicinity during the night.
From table 1.0, the value of R square is 0.026, indicating that 2.6% of the variation on students consuming alcohol can be clarified by the combined variation of individuals in the vicinity getting along with each other, individuals vend or use drugs in the vicinity, I feel secure being out alone in my vicinity, individuals often get mugged, robbed or assaulted in my vicinity, and individuals in my vicinity could be trusted. However, the adjusted R square, which takes into account the number of variables and the sample size, demonstrates that only 0.3% of the variation in the reliant variable can be clarified by combined variations of the reliant variable (Ramachandran & Tsokos, 2021).
From table 2.0, the p-value is 0.342, which is greater than 0.05. This implies that the regression analysis is not notable to clarify the reliant variable using the autonomous variables (Maneejuk & Yamaka, 2020). From the correlations results in table 3.0; I feel secure being out alone in my vicinity, individuals often get mugged, robbed or assaulted in my vicinity, and individuals in my vicinity usually got along with each other have a weak positive correlation with how often do you have a drink containing alcohol? Individuals vend or use drugs in my vicinity, and Individuals in my vicinity could be trusted has a weak negative correlation with how often do you have a drink containing alcohol? (da Silva Filho et al., 2021).
