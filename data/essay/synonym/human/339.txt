The airline sector has been hit particularly hard by Covid 19. The virus outbreak has caused the governments of most countries to enforce restrictions on traveling (Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Aviation, 2022). Consequently, the regulatory implementations have adversely impacted the standard revenue, business practices, and procedures of airline companies. Initially, passengers were less eager to travel due to the testing regulations, limited resources, and the lack of necessity to travel for work. Another factor was the regulations themselves that suggested a decrease in Covid-19 cases through quarantine measures. The low demand has led the airlines to lose revenue ($372 bn), which was an unprecedented shift in the industry (Economic impacts of covid-19 on Civil Aviation, 2021).
Flights were being called off, and employees were let go due to the challenging situation in which the corporations could not maintain airports with such a low passenger rate. The airline companies have faced significant economic challenges that have been exacerbated by all the adverse effects of the pandemic on civil aviation. Consequently, fewer seats were being offered (-50%), and fewer passengers were able to travel by plane (-2,7 bn) (Economic impacts of covid-19 on Civil Aviation, 2021). The impact was somewhat offset due to the fact that cargo flights have been less affected or even increased in rates due to the transportation of medical supplies (Nižetić, 2020, p. 10953).
Nevertheless, as vaccines became accessible and fewer restrictions were implemented, the situation has improved in 2021. More opportunities have arisen due to the less rigid regulatory implementations, vaccination, and other advantageous factors. As illustrated in the relevant literature, the lost revenue in 2021 was slightly lower ($324 Bn). Although these figures appear bleak, the year 2021 has witnessed a slight improvement, with the future years expected to be progressively better.
