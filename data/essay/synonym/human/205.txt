Lawsuit Overview
The lawsuit regarding Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Hardison focuses on the employer's failure to adjust to the employeeâ€™s religious day of observance. The complainant, Hardison, was a staff member at Trans World Airlines and a devout Jew who honored Sabbath every Saturday. According to Jewish customs, Saturday, the seventh day of the week, is a day of rest during which followers of Judaism refrain from work. As Sabbath, also known as Shabbat, holds religious significance in Judaism, it was crucial for Hardison to have shifts that permitted him to be free on Saturdays.
Trans World Airlines operated a system based on seniority that granted each employee a certain level of precedence in selecting their shifts. For a period, Hardison worked in a TWA department that allowed him enough seniority to pick shifts that aligned with his Sabbath observance. However, upon switching roles voluntarily, his seniority no longer granted him the flexibility to avoid scheduling work on Saturdays. Despite the company's efforts to accommodate Hardison's religious requirements, it couldn't agree to his suggestion of working only four days a week. Hardison's refusal to work on Saturdays ultimately led to his dismissal.
The plaintiff argued that the company failed to accommodate him and breached Title VII, which safeguards individuals against religious bias. Nevertheless, the court determined that TWA made a reasonable attempt to accommodate Hardison, and adjusting his schedule to four days a week would disrupt the department's operations due to understaffing. Nonetheless, the Court of Appeals contended that TWA didn't adequately explore alternative solutions to Hardison's scheduling issue and rejected three viable options. Despite the company's claims of potential challenges, it could have assigned Hardison's Saturday shift to another employee for overtime pay. However, deviating from the seniority regulations for one employee, regardless of the minimal individual impact, would establish a precedent for future instances. Consequently, granting special treatment to Hardison would have resulted in substantial long-term costs for TWA. Nonetheless, the Court of Appeals found TWA accountable for not exerting sufficient effort to accommodate Hardison.

The options proposed by the court of appeals
The Court of Appeals presented several options for TWA in Hardison's scheduling dilemma. However, none of these options were feasible in the long run due to various reasons, absolving TWA from responsibility for terminating Hardison. Initially, allowing the plaintiff to work four days a week would lead to understaffing and burden other employees unnecessarily. Additionally, granting Hardison freedom to bypass the seniority system and select his hours would be unfair to other employees. Lastly, compelling another employee to take on additional hours would not only be unfair to the staff but also strain the company's finances in the future. Introducing a precedent could trigger numerous similar cases, disrupting operations.
Preventing religious bias and addressing religious variations
In certain cases, agreements, rules, rights, and inconsistencies in judgments may coexist. However, if there is no viable solution that reconciles preventing religious bias with the collective bargaining agreement, one must prioritize. Since the company made efforts to accommodate Hardison's religious needs, including assisting in job searches, it shouldn't be faulted for inconsistencies. Furthermore, Hardison opted to change roles, being aware of the company's seniority and scheduling policies. Given the unavoidable trade-off, it is crucial for the company to uphold the agreement to foster a collaborative and trustworthy work environment.
Alternative resolution of this dispute
Had Hardison consulted me about the scheduling conflict before transferring, I would have advised him against changing roles and helped explore alternative options. I would have assisted in finding job opportunities that accommodated both Shabbat observance and company regulations. Religious accommodation warrants utmost respect, yet favoritism towards employees should be avoided. Alternatively, if Hardison sought assistance post-transfer, knowing he lacked sufficient seniority to avoid Saturday shifts, I would have collaborated on finding solutions, like having another staff member cover his shift routinely. If no compromise was reached within two weeks, termination would be necessary. The Court's dismissal of the company's efforts was unwarranted, and they should have deemed the attempts adequate.
