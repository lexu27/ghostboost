The worldwide corporation is PwC India, a business situated in India. The corporation concentrates on crucial sectors, such as the government and public sector, digital services, and technology advising. PwC India is at its enhancement level according to the global project management maturity model (Naim et al., 2021). This is due to its maturity phase, which is also noted as the highest in terms of capability maturity model integration. By deploying a global project management structure, PwC India has greatly profited from a sequence of occurrences. First and foremost, the corporation has transformed and continues to enhance its operational procedures significantly. Secondly, the implementation has led to a visible enhancement in the innovation domain. As per Naim, Alahmari & Rahim (2021), innovation has led to significant progress, which has greatly contributed to the performance. Lastly, the structure has improved the development of people’s abilities, which have established efficient delivery of high-quality intricate information and technology programs in a timely manner—actions that have enhanced Indians returns on IT investments.
As being at the ultimate and highest level of global project management, I would suggest PwC India corporation actively involve its staff on managerial facets. The step will seek to maximize the relevant example that could endanger the operations and operation systems (Naim et al., 2021). Additionally, since the corporation is at its final stage, absolute improvement and continuous monitoring will be crucial in preserving the company for the next 2-5 years.
