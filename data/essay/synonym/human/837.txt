The article by Vargas and Soriano is devoted to a groundbreaking solution in the educational domain, specifically the utilization of blockchain technology in Edublocs. In the preface, researchers highlight the issues of the contemporary educational system that can be addressed with the assistance of Edublocs (Vargas & Scott, 2019). The key characteristic of the blockchain is the impossibility of loss, harm, or counterfeiting of an educational paper. As a block generated once cannot be altered anymore, it cannot be eradicated from the network (Fedorova & Skobleva, 2020). Consequently, the trustworthiness and completeness of the information are ensured, and the learning past can turn entirely transparent.
Subsequently, there is both a theoretical and a practical examination of the Edublocs platform. The initial segment of the core part presents the theoretical aspects of employing the application, and the subsequent one displays the interface of the platform (Vargas & Scott, 2019). The Edublocs blockchain platform will bring together pupils, educational establishments, employers, and recruiters, as it will be formulated considering their requirements (Vargas & Scott, 2019). This will provide the field not only with a practical tool for communication but will drive it towards significant alterations and the emergence of new resolutions. A distinct portion of the article is focused on mentors: the writers observe that the incorporation of new technologies will necessitate drastic alterations in educational institutions. These transformations will mainly impact the alteration of administration, management techniques, financial management, and distinct individuals (Ismail et al., 2019). Hence, currently, it is crucial to equip the teaching personnel and staff for substantial modifications.
To conclude, researchers state that the outcome of the integration of blockchain technologies in education will be the mechanization of production processes and the delivery of services. This suggests that those educational establishments that have transitioned to a contemporary developed digital infrastructure will be capable of preserving economic stability. Utilizing Edublocs will empower these educational establishments to remain competitive.
