Preamble
California has enacted a law to decrease the quantity of correctional facilities. The state views this as a significant stride toward substantial judicial reform, as the number of individuals in custody will diminish. My investigative query aims to uncover how this Realignment served as a viable solution to the issue of overcrowding in the Californian prison system. The significance of this inquiry lies in the fact that overcrowding in detention facilities constitutes a severe humanitarian dilemma. Such circumstances curtail the rights and liberties of inmates, heighten the potential for conflicts, and situations that could lead to the destabilization of the operational environment within correctional institutions.

It is crucial to discern the response to determine whether implementing prison reductions in areas where overcrowding is highly delicate is warranted. The validation or contradiction of the efficiency of the approach utilized in California hinges on its subsequent application to address a pressing issue. In the course of exploring the analogous investigative question, prior scholars have discovered that the reform applied in California possesses notable deficiencies. Notably, when the detention capacity was reduced, there was no substantial decline in criminal activities.

The primary subjects I utilize as headings in my review of literature are the compassion of penitentiary reductions, the aftermaths of penitentiary system transformation, and the accessibility to justice. The ongoing study lacks analysis concerning how the execution of the penitentiary system reform plan accommodates societal needs. In this manuscript, I will employ empirical research techniques, particularly the scrutiny of scientific studies and the evaluation of the data gathered. This proposed investigation will progress understanding and address gaps in the current research by concentrating on a fresh facet of the issue. Instead of employing the number of inmates per unit area as indicators of overcapacity, the detention conditions will be employed as a benchmark in this endeavor.

Literature Review
Introduction
The autonomous factor in this study is the quantity of correctional facilities. The two reliant factors are the number of inmates and their detention circumstances. Ongoing research indicates that there are presently six penitentiaries in California. Furthermore, according to researchers, there are 9 detainees for every penitentiary system staff member in California (Bartos and Kubrin 2018). Moreover, in line with the report, California ranks among the five states with the greatest proportion of female prisoners (Bird, Nguyen, and Grattet 2021). Researchers assert that this constitutes a distinct group of prisoners who necessitate specific conditions.

The ongoing experience of diminishing the number of correctional facilities in California is somewhat intriguing to researchers. The three trends in the research archives primarily revolve around the discussion of the humanity in detaining prisoners in novel conditions. The papers strive to scrutinize a range of humanitarian issues concerning the detention of Californian citizens (Bird, Nguyen, and Grattet 2021). Additionally, current studies deliberate on the outcomes of transforming the penitentiary system both for the inmates themselves and for society (Lin 2018). Another noticeable trend in research is the introduction of the debate on methodologies for reducing detainees (Grattet, Bird, and Nguyen 2017). The authors are concerned about the subsequent reduction in access to justice.

Compassion of Penitentiary Reductions
The loopholes in the present state of knowledge linked to this research question are related to the fact that numerical values are frequently furnished in research. For instance, overcrowding in Californian prisons is verified by computing the population density or the number of staff per inmate (Bartos and Kubrin 2018). Nevertheless, the studies neglect comparisons of the adherence of the punishment implementation content with international standards in this domain. The deterioration in the execution of sentences for California convicts is not ascertained by their detention conditions. The deterioration in the medical, sanitary, and material support of convicts outlined in the studies is fleeting and minor (Bartos and Kubrin 2018). They are not elaborated on adequately and are predominantly presented in numerical formats.

The origins of uncertainty are the criteria used to ascertain the humanitarian welfare of inmates. Following the reduction in the number of correctional facilities in California, the number of individuals per institution has increased (Bird, Nguyen, and Grattet 2021). Nonetheless, researchers fail to reach a consensus on the appropriate expenditure on food and personal possessions of inmates monthly (Welsh 2019). Disagreements also arise concerning the cell area and the bed placements (Bird, Nguyen, and Grattet 2021). Moreover, varying viewpoints exist regarding the necessity of factoring in the psychological state of inmates (Grattet, Bird, and Nguyen 2017). Any form of bias could serve as a criterion for augmented density.

Consequences of Transforming the Penitentiary System
It is acknowledged that the reduction in the quantity of penitentiary buildings does not equate to a decrease in the number of individuals serving criminal sentences. Nevertheless, the impact of the transformation on detainees has not been thoroughly examined. Scientists diverge in their opinions on how the adjustments have influenced adherence to international penitentiary standards (Welsh 2019). The list of challenges confronting the Californian penitentiary system is not completely outlined (Bartos and Kubrin 2018). The rights of inmates are enshrined in norms, but the practical execution and safeguarding of their rights and legitimate interests remain ambiguous.

Discrepancies arise in the appraisals of the challenges in ensuring the conditions for serving sentences in Californian correctional institutions and the strategies to address them. Some scientists are uncertain that the issues emerging in the execution of custodial sentences encounter identical challenges (Grattet, Bird, and Nguyen 2017). A subset of researchers believe that following the transformation, the detention conditions no longer adhere to normative standards (Lin 2018). Conversely, others argue that Californian penitentiaries enforce stringent detention conditions but do not contravene international norms (Bird, Nguyen, and Grattet 2021). Consequently, the structure of ensuring the regimen and safety of inmates in Californian prisons is of interest from the perspective of the inmates themselves.

Access to Justice
Researchers concur that averting overcrowding in prisons amidst a reduction in their quantity is solely feasible through a decline in the crime rate. Nonetheless, the efficacy of mechanisms to attain this objective remains uncertain. Certain researchers advocate for the humanization and enhancement of criminal statutes (Bartos and Kubrin 2018). Conversely, other scientists raise concerns that substituting imprisonment with forced labor could yield counterproductive outcomes (Welsh 2019). The mitigation of penalties might fuel motivation for engaging in criminal activities punishable by law. Subsequently, this could result in prison overcrowding.

Experts diverge: some contend that the reduction in the inmate population does not stem from a drop in crime escalation. They advocate for a consistent policy of humanizing criminal penalties implemented in California (Bartos and Kubrin 2018). Conversely, other researchers apprehend a surge in violent crimes linked to penalty mitigation (Bird, Nguyen, and Grattet 2021). They argue that the number of offenders remains unchanged, yet penalties have become less severe. The population of convicts in correctional facilities is dwindling, but the count of individuals registered with the criminal executive inspections is increasing. Thus, the ramifications of the liberalization of penal enforcement policies on the inmate count in California remain inadequately elucidated.
