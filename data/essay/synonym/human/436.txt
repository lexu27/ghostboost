McDonald’s initiated legal action in the United States against its former CEO, Steve Easterbrook, after it was disclosed that he had multiple consensual sexual encounters with employees in the year prior to his departure and concealed them. Easterbrook deceived authorities and disposed of evidence of his misconduct; he favored his interests over those of McDonald’s. Shareholders have filed a lawsuit against the company for trying to prevent misbehavior and prioritizing speed over accuracy in resolving the matter. Negligent recruitment and retention liability are commonly used to characterize an employer’s commitment not to recruit or retain an employee (Monteiro et al., 2019). The manager was cognizant of or should have been aware of the probability of engaging in misconduct against others or otherwise exposing employees or third parties to legal liability. Businesses can be held responsible for their employees’ deliberate misconduct (dos Santos et al., 2017). This study is intended to examine the negligence case at work since negligence is the most prevalent form of tort.
If a McDonald’s neglects to thoroughly screen an employee before hiring them and they harm others, the company may be accountable for their actions. For example, a McDonald’s should review all prior employment, certification credentials, and current professional affiliations before hiring a head chef (Rushchenko et al., 2020). If the chef makes repeated culinary mistakes that pose health risks to customers, the popular fast food chain is likely to be held responsible as it failed to conduct a basic employment background check. This is one reason why criminal record checks are mandatory. If an individual assaults colleagues and customers and can prove that a criminal record check uncovered previous violent behavior, the company may be held responsible. Suppose an employer is aware of an employee's risky, erratic, or disrespectful behavior but does not terminate the employee. In that case, McDonald’s could be liable for ensuring the safety of others.
