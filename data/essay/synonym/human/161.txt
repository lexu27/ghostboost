Preface
Digital services can be utilized to offer a broad array of distant services, including patient treatment and education, and surveillance. Telemedicine is an innovative technology that has the potential to transform and enhance the healthcare system by reducing expenses, enhancing quality, and increasing patient contentment. Amid the recent COVID-19 pandemic, which impacted both privately insured and Medicare recipients, patients increasingly obtained medical care from providers not located in proximity to their physicians. There were limitations on who could deliver services and where they could be reimbursed before the pandemic. Because of COVID-19, Congress and the CMS expanded traditional Medicare's coverage of telehealth services to promote medical care accessibility and reduce exposure to coronavirus in healthcare environments. Without legislative intervention, Medicare's telehealth coverage will return to its pre-pandemic status when the public health crisis concludes.
A Novel Contribution-Based Incentive Scheme (CBI)
This manuscript proposes a fresh physician remuneration scheme that recognizes productivity, quality, and community engagement. The CBI Scheme merges a secure foundational wage with customizable core motivators to offer physicians increased career adaptability. Fundamentally, the CBI scheme aims to inspire physicians based on their results and quality and provides substantial career independence. The scheme also steers institutional responsibility and the level of clinical and other correlated tasks in physician domains to a higher level.
A Versatile Formula Aligns Diverse Interests
Salary-centered payment strategies will become more prevalent in the healthcare sector following the pandemic as physicians seek a more secure and foreseeable income source. A fundamental yet meaningful part of the total compensation is the objective of this model's basic salary (Kwon & Kim, 2022). Undoubtedly, the initial salary of a physician is higher than that of an entry-level worker. Nevertheless, physicians can anticipate a salary increase by fulfilling or surpassing their employers' vision, strategic direction, and specific objectives. A modest foundational salary serves as a safety net for physicians, lessening the likelihood of burnout or other adverse repercussions of financial stress. Performance will be enhanced if incentive points are openly and transparently assigned.
Numerous prerequisites must be fulfilled before physicians can engage in the bonus framework, including consistent clinical activity and productivity congruent with the physician's foundational salary (based on fair market value). Second, quality standards with outcomes established by the institution, and third, agreed-upon community service efforts (Brousselle et al., 2020). By varying financial support for each "Core Motivator" based on the enterprise's objectives, needs, and intentions, it is plausible to influence physician conduct.
Augmented Productivity Results in Increased Revenue
In the business realm, productivity and revenue are directly proportional in various aspects. Revenue generation is aligned with productivity rates in most scenarios. Work relative value units are the metrics utilized to quantify physician productivity at present (wRVUs) (Mehrotra et al., 2020). Productivity-focused incentive compensation can be granted to prevent counterproductive behavior and excessive utilization (a suitable proportion of foundational pay, incentives, or compensation benchmarks). It is thus apparent that productivity hinges directly on incentives extended to employees.
Quality Metrics Prioritize Patient Care
Commercial and governmental payers have established quality criteria to reward providers for their services. Criteria employed to evaluate healthcare practitioners encompass documented diagnoses and patient communications, treatment and pain/symptom management, readmissions, and preventive screenings. While these metrics can serve as a basis for superior outcomes, it is essential to tailor them to each patient's particular requirements. With input from relevant stakeholders and physician practice administrators, enterprises are advised to devise distinct Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).
Citizenship Enhances a Contemporary, Patient-Oriented, and Integrated Image
The third element is patient and brand allegiance and market expansion.
Championing Patient Contentment Metrics; consequently, Ganey, an autonomous research organization, remains a leading authority in this domain. Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS), employing this approach, we recommend bestowing points to organizations based on survey results and other satisfaction criteria. By actively embracing novel technologies, physicians should be commended for exploring and utilizing innovative technologies that enhance patient care and efficiency. Post-pandemic, there will be a substantial demand for treatment beyond traditional healthcare facilities, with virtual health services playing a crucial role in meeting these demands (Smith et al., 2020). It is feasible to monitor and gauge telemedicine education, coaching, and application metrics. This facet may support digital health and other state-of-the-art technologies.
Office regulations and procedures and incentive initiatives can foster adherence to organizational and clinical standards and procedures. Both the physician and the enterprise will benefit from the adoption of these measures.
Promote an entity's image through administrative roles and marketing Leaders in the CBI Scheme, which encompasses leadership compensation. Engaging in quality enhancement committees or medical supply formulary boards can also qualify as a leadership endeavor. Additional potential leadership activities encompass public speaking and research publications and involvement in administrative boards, and media/public engagements (Smith et al., 2020). Through an objective, well-defined approach, physicians and enterprises can instill mutual trust. The success of the CBI Scheme can be attributed to a structure that mandates quantifiable activities consistently communicated to participating general practitioners openly and transparently. Fostering a sense of equity and constructive competition among peers is feasible thanks to the transparency of the process. Physicians are categorized into quartiles based on their performance in each Core Motivator, with a recommendation for weighted payouts for the top performers in each quartile. With more physicians eligible for Core Motivator payouts, there is a greater allocation of Core Motivator Funding. Physicians are encouraged to stimulate engagement among their colleagues to maximize incentives.
Epilogue
In essence, the CBI Scheme's alignment models and proposed revisions to the AKS and Stark laws complement and reinforce the model's relevance while upholding its fundamental tenets. The scheme is a critical element in motivating general service providers. Following the COVID-19 outbreak, healthcare providers have been compelled to reassess the value of end-to-end care, a tactic reliant on cutting-edge technology to provide suitable care at the appropriate time and place.
