Historical Background
An expanse of nearly 653 thousand square meters, situated in the regions of Southwest Asia, traditionally pertains to the territory of Afghanistan. Afghanistan lacks access to the sea or the ocean and is adjacent to other nations from all directions. Consequently, the country's western boundaries are linked with Iran and Turkmenistan; towards the north, it borders Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. On the southeastern perimeter, Afghanistan is entirely bordered by Pakistan from the Gulf of Oman. Notably, the complete expanse of the nation is situated in the Iranian highlands, so a significant portion of the area is characterized by mountainous and hilly topography (Allchin, 2021). The Hindu Kush mountain range is the most prevalent there, as its peaks, up to 7708 meters high, stretch from east to west of the country. Nevertheless, this does not signify that there are no flatlands present. Conversely, to the north of the country, near Tajikistan, Afghanistan possesses the Bactrian Plain, which encompasses a unique geographic region resembling an extension of the clay-sandy Karakum desert. There are also mountainous hollows and valleys along other boundaries of the nation, representing valuable clay and sand reservoirs for the populace.
Geographical factors entirely dictate the local climatic conditions, the influence of which is distinctly observable in the Afghan flora. Thus, the weather there is characteristic of subtropical continental regions, with the prevalence of monsoon winds. During summertime, the climate is typically warm and arid, but the local circumstances seldom turn frigid with the advent of winter. Afghan summer temperatures can reach 122 â„‰ while temperatures rarely dip below freezing in January (Allchin, 2021). Whereas winters on the eastern flank of Afghanistan are predominantly chilly, closer to the north and south, temperatures tend to be more agreeable and mild. Most of the precipitation transpires during winter and spring. Concurrently, all river systems and lakes existing in Afghanistan are surface-level. This implies that there is no network of subaquatic connections, and any water flow is chiefly linked to its surface evaporation. As a result of a blend of climatic and geographic elements, the local vegetation is mainly characterized by aridity. Desert panoramas of the nation, distinctly fused with mountainous terrain, bestow the country with a plethora of herbaceous plants, including grains, legumes, and other blossoming crops.
Afghanistan is primarily a nation with a rich ancient history. Paleontological revelations propose that Afghanistan seems to be over five thousand years old, and some contend that it was inhabited as far back as the late Paleolithic epoch (Allchin, 2021). The protracted history accounts for the diverse array of ethnicities inhabiting Afghanistan. The most sizable communities here encompass Pashtuns (42%), Tajiks (28%), Hazaras (10%), Uzbeks (8%), Charaimaks (2.6%), Turkmen (2%), and other underrepresented ethnicities, encompassing Arabs, Mongols, and Kazakhs (AFP, 2021). Multi-ethnicity serves as the rationale for the bilingual and trilingual essence of the local populace: Afghans are typically proficient in Afghan and Persian, both of which belong to the Indo-European language family. As of 2021, Afghanistan's population was 40 million before the occurrences of the Afghan August (WPR, 2021). This diversity of multi-ethnic communities is mirrored in the cultural and religious ethos.
For instance, most Afghans are conventional Sunni orthodox believers. Amid such adherents, militancy, and bloody vengeance, distinctly intertwined with hospitality, is commonly prevalent. The archetypal role of women as subservient mothers and devoted wives also emanates from this (Onsutti, 2019). In a sense, we can specify that Islam for contemporary Afghanistan acts as the conduit that unites disparate nationalities and alleviates conflicts. Alternative religions are meagerly represented and discouraged there: conversion to Christianity is penalized by death, and both Hinduism and Protestantism are persecuted.
Factions Represented in Afghanistan
Afghanistan's political sphere is linked with American and Soviet interference, jihad, and terrorism. It might appear that the territory is the abode of all terrorists, but that is not the scenario. Currently, the fundamental religious and political factions contending for power in Afghanistan are the Taliban, ISIS, al-Qaeda, and the Northern Resistance, which have diminished noticeably since the American withdrawal from Afghanistan (Wolf, 2021). It must be noted that until August 15, 2021, when the nation eventually fell under Taliban governance, Afghanistan upheld a republican approach with its president and constitution. Despite the ongoing civil conflict in the nation, Afghanistan was progressively veering away from the trajectory of Islamic extremism and granting more civil liberties to the populace.
With the advent of the Taliban, most of the reforms and advancements of the previous decade had already been overturned, and the strides made towards acknowledging women's rights and minorities had been nullified. The orthodox Taliban movement is doctrinaire: their principal objective is to instill in the Afghan people the formerly stringent order of Islam, with a profound acknowledgment of clan affiliations and the five pillars of Islam. The Taliban harbors extreme political aspirations, as the usurpation of power and the restructuring of the state necessitate rigorous political measures from the group. ISIS may seem to be a collaborator of the Taliban since, externally, it appears that the two factions share similar aims. Certain resemblances in functions do not ensure a partnership, as the Taliban and ISIS are formally regarded as adversaries. The initial operations of ISIS supporters ostensibly commenced in 2014 with Pakistan, when representatives advocated for joining (Nazish, 2014). A year later, having reached the pinnacle of their geopolitical clout, ISIS leaders officially proclaimed their ingress into Afghanistan as an adapted Wilayat Khorasan faction (Paybarah, 2021). ISIS's Afghan presence was founded on refugees and migrants from Pakistan who capitalized on the hospitality of the Afghan populace. Over time, ISIS Afghanistan burgeoned in political and religious influence, and the U.S., then still stationed in Afghanistan, facilitated the elimination of key figures in the movement (Morgan, 2020). Unofficially, but effectively, it was a collaborative endeavor between the U.S. military and the Taliban to eradicate a mutual formidable adversary. Ultimately, the Afghan ISIS was vanquished, and the leaders were either executed or incarcerated. Meanwhile, on August 26, 2021, ISIS claimed responsibility for a terrorist assault at the Kabul airport as thousands of refugees endeavored to flee the country (Hubbard et al., 2021). The Taliban authorities reacted unfavorably to this act and executed the detained ISIS members.
Al-Qaida also represents the Islamic terrorist organization present in Afghanistan, but the objectives of this faction differ from the Taliban. Al-Qaida is known to trace its origins to Bin Laden, a hardline, militant proponent (Wright, 2021). Al-Qaida is one of the severest and most radical groups: its members espouse Wahhabism. Among the goals of this faction is the eradication of the Taliban, the propagation of radical Islamism, and the establishment of a global caliphate. Hence, al-Qaida also harbors political aspirations, and
