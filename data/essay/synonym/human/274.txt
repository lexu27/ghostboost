The reserves presented in the module enable discussion of the future of epidemiology and its transformation to fulfill the emerging challenges of a new era. Brilliant (2006) stresses that it is feasible to eradicate epidemiological threats, especially infectious diseases, through early detection and response. New technologies such as vast data can assist scientists in better comprehending the features of viruses and diseases and reaching broader populations (Khoury & Wei, 2015). Consequently, more effective data collection and analysis will enable epidemiologists to better grasp the causes and patterns of infections and diseases, which will facilitate enhanced detection. Moreover, technologies such as social media can aid researchers in reacting more efficiently to threats by monitoring global epidemiological threats and outbreaks (Center for Infectious Disease Dynamics, 2016). In the future, epidemiology may embrace different tools to manage diseases and viruses on a larger scale. Although such an approach will permit quicker detection and response to threats, it is impracticable to entirely eradicate them.

Hence, I do not concur that in the future, even the advancement of epidemiology can result in the total eradication of diseases. Nonetheless, I presume that scientists will discover how to react more effectively to them with deeper knowledge, and with the aid of technology, this aspect is probable to diminish mortality from various diseases and infections significantly. Aylward (2014) observes that complacency at this stage will be the most significant epidemiological threat. If all diseases are eradicated, humanity will be unable to react promptly to sudden and unforeseen threats, which will culminate in disaster. Therefore, I believe that in the future, it will be feasible to eliminate global epidemiological threats like pandemics, but local outbreaks will still transpire.
