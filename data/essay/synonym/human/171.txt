The deterioration of the 14-15th centuries, also called the dilemma of the belated Middle Ages, is a term utilized in Western historiography to allude to the recession processes that occurred in some nations of Western Europe. Western historians, analyzing the socio-economic processes in some European nations in the 14-15th centuries, paid specific attention to the “crisis phenomena” in the European economy of these periods (Cole and Symes). They emphasized primarily the movement of prices, population, “desolation” of lands, and others as determining factors of recession (Cole and Symes). Even though the Middle Ages were once perceived as a time of ignorance and social oppression, it is now recognized as a dynamic period during which the notion of Europe as a distinct cultural unit emerged. Since the 20s of the 14th century, the economic decline in the history of Europe has commenced. The population was decreasing, while cultivated lands were predominantly deserted. Cities were declining, agricultural and industrial products were diminishing, technological progress was halted, the advancement of trade, predominantly foreign exchange, was decelerating, prices were dropping. In addition, the period is primarily characterized by overcoming feudal fragmentation and the establishment of centralized states in France and England. By utilizing the financial resources of the cities, the kings could continuously maintain a mercenary army to combat rebellious feudal lords. The advent of firearms at the commencement of the XIV century diminished the significance of chivalry. Castles could not endure artillery, and the introduction of hand-held firearms rendered heavy knight armor meaningless. Following the era of swift population growth, Europe confronted the depression phase. It has been conventionally believed that the late Middle Ages are vividly marked by demographic decline. Three notable factors contributed to the recession: plague epidemic, famine, and numerous wars. Furthermore, the climatic conditions were also accountable since winters became severe at the conclusion of the 13th century. The soil was inadequate for planting crops which adversely affected the nutrition of European residents. During the Great Famine, thousands of individuals perished daily because of the scarcity of food, parents traded and consumed their children, cannibalism was widespread. Hence, the population battled to survive and did not concentrate on materialistic objectives. Another cause for the downturn was the plague which rapidly spread around Europe and exterminated millions of individuals. It is assumed that the epidemic infiltrated almost every corner of the continent, wiping out from 30 to 50 percent of the population (Cole and Symes). The massive exodus from the cities seized by the disease gave rise to anarchy, panic, and mob rule. Due to the fear of falling ill, anyone who sparked even the slightest suspicion was forcefully taken to the infirmary. The suicide epidemic, which intensified alongside the expansion of infection, compelled the authorities to enact special laws that threatened those who took their own lives to expose their corpses to the public. Along with the sick, healthy individuals frequently ended up in the infirmary, who were discovered in the same residence with the ill or deceased, which compelled individuals to conceal the sick and clandestinely bury the corpses. Consequently, the contemporaries again had the sole objective – survival. Ultimately, the uprisings created intense circumstances for the Europeans in the belated Middle Ages. The oppression on the impoverished induced peasants to revolt against the nobles. Being a peasant was regarded as something derogatory, which opposed affluence and status. While the aristocracy was accustomed to a lavish lifestyle, the destitute considered it deceitful. Consequently, these two classes clashed with escalated violence. However, the nobles overpowered those from lower stratification since they possessed more power. Additionally, the War of Roses, Hundred Years’ War, Polish-Teutonic Wars, and some others substantially ravaged the European territory leading to political, economic, and social disharmony. Consequently, the population endeavored to make ends meet to survive. For all its versatility, spirituality, and culture of the Middle Ages were constructed around one vector. Religion permeated all spheres of life in medieval society and altered their understanding of crisis (Gaddy 72). The Church persisted in eradicating heresy to a significant extent, suppressing religious sects and urging priests to penalize unorthodox adherents (Gaddy). Meanwhile, the peasantry practiced pagan rituals and commenced blending them with Catholic ones. The Church evolved into the epicenter of social contradictions, weakening the political authority of the Papacy in the 14th century. This further led to the progression of independent centralized states. The religious presumptions also sparked the advancement of art and sciences, instigated by the advancement of universities and the dissemination of scholarship. The revived fascination with ancient literature led to the Italian Proto-Renaissance (Cole and Symes). Antiquities, comprising books, have been accumulating in Europe since the Crusades (Cole and Symes). The invention of printing also contributed to the dissemination of knowledge. Formerly scarce and expensive books gradually became publicly accessible, paving the way for the European reformation. The first Italian humanist, Francesco Petrarch, revitalized man’s science – humanities. Humanists believed that eternal truths were concealed beneath the guise of the poetic fiction of ancient literature. They rejected the entirety of academic knowledge with its ontological quandaries and brought to the forefront ethics, the science of the formation of human personality based on a reflective reading of Roman authors with their ideal of human dignity. The defining characteristic of Italian humanism was the command of classical instead of medieval Latin. Contemporaries esteemed Petrarch for his treatises on history and ethics, inscribed in exquisite classical Latin. Petrarch studied the norms of refined Latin from Cicero, whose works he diligently searched in the monastery libraries (Robinson 249). For his Latin compositions, Petrarch was crowned with a laurel wreath in Rome. Moreover, the New Testament was perceived as a basis of faith formation, particularly during the crisis. Since the Catholic faith was propagated by individuals, the New Testament was the book to rely on when praying (Luther 358). The church was amassing more authority compelling individuals to convert and making them serve for the greater good (Gaddy 114). It also aided in shaping the notion of chivalry and contributed to the elevation of women’s status in society (Luther 359). Consequently, the population endeavored to find solace resorting to religion amid the downturn. In conclusion, the crisis of the Middle Ages inflicted catastrophic repercussions on Europe; nevertheless, it gave rise to cultural formation. The downturn was predominantly steered by the plague, famine, and conflicts making contemporaries endure and battle for survival. Consequently, their sole aim was survival and striving to find conciliation in religion. The religious assumptions of that era have significantly influenced the evolution of culture and education.
