The ballet stemmed from a variety of movements and gestures linked to the activities and emotional impacts of an individual from the world around him. The motions were progressively subjected to artistic abstraction. Consequently, the art of ballet was shaped, one of the earliest displays of folk art. Anna Pavlova is among those who introduced the art of ballet to the United States. Initially linked with the word and song, the ballet slowly gained an independent significance. Cultural representatives like Anna Pavlova are revered personalities and have impacted the evolution of the ballet scene in the United States.
