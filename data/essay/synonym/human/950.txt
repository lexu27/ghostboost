Inherently, for me, Mexican civilization is challenging to delineate within a passage or even a complete essay. It is due to the extensive array of subtleties, impacts, and past that extends to Mesoamerican societies like Mayan and Aztec. There exist numerous demonstrations of Mexican civilization – in art, cuisine, traditions, principles, and faith. Therefore, if I were to define Mexican civilization, I would express that it is a distinct fusion of Mesoamerican legacy combined with European cultural impacts that molded the linguistic and spiritual convictions.
Generally, when illustrating Mexican civilization, one of the initial things that come to memory is religion. Mexican individuals are highly religious as some of the notable Mexican festivals are religious, such as Feast of Our Lady of Guadeloupe, which is commemorated on 12th December. Even though Christianity was enforced onto Aztec and Mayan societies, it subsequently became a pivotal component of the Mexican belief system. Spirituality and family ethics are also pivotal features of Mexican civilization. For instance, the Day of the Dead festival (1st & 2nd November) embodies both of those ethics as it brings together all families to recollect and revere relatives and companions who perished. Their spirits return to Earth; thus, families prepare distinct offerings to honor their forebears.
In contemporary mainstream culture, it is simple to visualize the first associations that individuals have when they hear about Mexico. They presumably envision something from this inventory: large hats, vibrant attire, delectable cuisine, and mariachi bands. I would opt for three symbols embodying Mexican civilization: attire during the Day of the Dead celebration (1), Mariachi band, and Pyramid of the Moon: Teotihuacán (3).
Day of the Dead celebration embodies the mystical, spiritual, and family-focused tradition, which links living individuals with the deceased, creating a robust bond with one's ancestors.
It is challenging to envision any festivity without a respectable mariachi band. Music is a substantial part of Mexican civilization, as it embodies the fervor and the essence of the human soul.
Lastly, the pyramids that can be located throughout Mexico symbolize the correlation of Mexican civilization with Mesoamerican societies.
