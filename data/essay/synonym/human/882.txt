The adaptation process of new kids and their guardians can be demanding for them and the instructor. An instructor can apply various educational and communication methods to facilitate the process and assist the children and parents. I trust that sustaining continuous communication with guardians through meetings or phone conversations, while considering their time and privacy, is one of the most crucial aspects. Promoting home learning tasks and welcoming guardians into the classroom is also essential. Most guardians would prefer to be engaged in or notified about their children’s adaptation in a new classroom. Establishing guardians’ confidence by effectively communicating with them and involving them in cooperative issue-solving and planning would ease their and their children’s adaptation process. Being aware of their time and privacy is vital in forming a healthy parent-educator connection. According to Lin et al. (2019), home learning tasks can aid children in resolving their school engagement concerns. Educating guardians about the significance of home-based tasks would motivate them to take part, leading to parental help and engagement in the adaptation process of the children. For guardians and children experiencing separation anxiety, an instructor can welcome the guardians into the classroom. Nonetheless, it is crucial to explain the expectations and responsibilities to the guardians in advance to prevent misunderstandings. Overall, it would soothe the children and reassure the guardians of their children’s safety during the adaptation process. The adaptation process of children and guardians to a new classroom and instructor is demanding; nevertheless, there are methods to make it simpler for all the individuals. I believe that being considerate and sustaining educator-guardian communication is the most crucial factor in adjusting to a new schooling setting. Inviting the guardians to the classroom can aid with the separation anxiety in both children and their guardians. Furthermore, promoting home learning tasks would resolve the engagement concern of the children.
