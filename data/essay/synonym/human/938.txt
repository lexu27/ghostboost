For years, individuals' viewpoint of social parity has been connected with the concept of disregarding ethnic association. Nonetheless, rather than embracing the notion of universal fairness, this idea led to the explicit empowerment of white supremacy. For instance, commemorating parity in the US essentially implied being categorized and assimilated into the portrayal of a Caucasian white male. Therefore, while at some juncture, society sought to eradicate bias through everyone being "the same underneath," only ethnic, gender, and sexual minorities were compelled to relinquish their identity. The consequence of such assimilation is particularly clear in the situation of Japanese Americans and their extensive assimilation aimed at forming the model minority (Shih et al., 2019). To be welcomed in the society, minority groups were pressured to adopt another culture as their own.
Such unawareness should never be confused with parity of being identical. The strength of parity is to permit one to exhibit their cultural identity without the dread of being marginalized in society. Furthermore, embracing authentic interest in various cultures is what propels individuals to develop in their outlook on the world and critical thinking. Decades of bias have erased the past of numerous ethnic minorities, so now is the moment to ensure that everyone learns and values their forefathers to the same degree. Unquestionably, many individuals fixate on the reality that the concept of multi-culturalism is exceedingly intricate, particularly in professional or academic environments. However, the exploration of cultural variety should never focus on producing exclusive communities with nothing in common. Diversity is about collective learning of one's principles to discover common ground with no bias against minorities.
