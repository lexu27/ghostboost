In the ancient and primitive works of art, the depiction of women and men shows a significant imbalance in gender equality favoring men over women. The males were assumed superior and of significant importance in the society, while the females were perceived as subordinates (Seejarim). The Venus of Willendorf is the initial primitive art that showcased women in art, and it was unearthed in Austria. Perceptions of gender have been translated into visual arts and depictions. During the Old stage, men and women fulfilled different roles and duties in the household (Seejarim). While men were assigned hunting, women were in charge of gathering, looking after children, and maintaining racial conformity.

Unlike most women’s artistic representations, the Venus of Willendorf, discovered in Austria, commemorates the female physique without objectification. The woman of Willendorf was viewed as a fertility symbol for regeneration, charm of good fortune, and a portrayal of motherhood created by men for the admiration of men (Seejarim). This is apparent through the attributes of Venus; she is gentle, and plump, her bosoms are ample, and her hips full. 

The Kouros statue embodies the male sex, and it illustrates them as robust and muscular, befitting their dominant roles over the female sex. This artistic creation mirrors the society that has been overtaken by the boychild in the significance of leadership and supremacy in the community (Uçar). The Venus of Willendorf illustrates the role women have been allocated in society based on their characteristics like ample bosoms, enlarged hips, and round, indicating that women are accountable for procreation and childcare. Being soft and having a prominent kneecap implies that women excel at maintaining tribal concord, unlike the male sex in society.

Additionally, the Venus of Willendorf reveals that women were perceived not to have any practical function in the community as they are only seen for their bodies and fertility boosting the tribes. The Kouros, conversely, clearly illustrates that the male sex is designated the role of a leader in society (Uçar). They are also expected to go hunting to provide for the family as it portrays the male sex to be sturdy and muscular, hence dominating the female sex. Kouros also unmistakably delineates gender disparity in leadership since only the male child has been entrusted with the responsibility of governance due to their masculinity, yet some women possess good leadership traits.

Besides Venus of Willendorf portraying women as merely fertility agents, the ancient work also depicted women as reliant beings on their male partners. The Venus sculpture had no feet, which can be interpreted as symbolizing a dependence (Uçar). The disparity of gender is evident in Korai and Kouros, which highlighted the distinctions in how the male and the females were treated in ancient Greek culture (Uçar). It is observed that Kouros body was uncovered to reveal the ideal muscular body of the male sex clearly.

Conversely, the body of Korai was clothed in loose garments to conceal her curves and generally feminine traits, appearing to safeguard her innocence. This indicates how well the male sex was preserved and esteemed in ancient Greek society (Seejarim). Unlike the female sex, the males dominated society and were regarded as the sturdy upholders of the community, and their presence was consistently valued.
