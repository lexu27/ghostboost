Although Lemuel Haynes and Mary Wollstonecraft deliberated two distinct issues, servitude and female rights, the core notion behind their works was that autonomy and liberty should be evenly dispensed to all in a cultured society. Haynes Liberty Further Extended and Wollstonecraft's A Vindication of the Rights of Woman were progressive at the time they were penned. Indeed, Haynes contends that freedom is an innate bestowed present to all human beings, irrespective of ethnicity (242). One of the distinguished feminists of that period, Wollstonecraft, articulated her thoughts with a substantial portion of ire, proposing that women should be equally permitted to aspire to the same objectives as men. Undoubtedly, virtuous existence is unattainable if all individuals do not have the identical opportunities to pursue their goals and share their inherent talents. This rhetorical examination asserts that both authors established the structure for defining the good life by asserting that entitlements and freedoms are intrinsic to all individuals and thus should not be stripped from someone.

Individuals may interpret the good life differently, but it is unfeasible if people cannot utilize their aptitude, abilities, and knowledge to achieve specific objectives. Wollstonecraft affirmed that women could evolve into superior citizens if men "be content with logical fellowship instead of servile compliance" since females would become more "attentive daughters, affectionate sisters, trustworthy wives, rational mothers" (179). Additionally, what is commendable or undesirable for one individual is equally respectable or malevolent to others (Haynes 246). Both authors concur that liberty is indispensable for all individuals, and this concept can be characterized as having consistent opportunities, freedom of speech, and parity before the law (Wollstonecraft 230). If the law is jeopardized, individuals cannot realize a good life; hence, the more parity prevails in society, the more virtuous it may become. However, from policymakers' perspective, women were inferior beings, permitting the administration to fashion the ambiance that would facilitate men's triumph (Wollstonecraft 30). Indeed, Wollstonecraft's ironic demeanor in her writing hints that the regulations of that era were double-dealing because they permitted white males to govern and discriminate against individuals based on their ethnicity and gender.

It is conceivably unattainable to achieve a virtuous life in a nation if some factions are stripped of their rights or oblivious of their choices. If only a fraction of a faction's potential is engaged in decision-making, it cannot realize the utmost potential. Consequently, Wollstonecraft advocated the concept that women should acquire physical and emotional robustness to evolve into fully operational constituents of society; in that scenario, virtuous life will become plausible (31). Furthermore, the author seems repelled by refinement, delicacy, and gentleness, branding them as the hindrances to a good life (Wollstonecraft 31). Wollstonecraft is not ironic about these attributes, but she seems affronted by the reality that strength is men's prerogative and a taboo for women. Nonetheless, her demeanor is satirical when she discusses the male population's dread that if females are allowed to exercise and obtain superior education, they will become overly masculine as it may not be appealing. The author also believes that being articulate should no longer be a precedence in the world that endeavors to establish a good life.

Haynes did not employ irony or reproachful language to assert that servitude is fundamentally incorrect; instead, he opted to utilize the name of God to substantiate that liberty and freedom are divine bestowals. Therefore, these inherent rights cannot be expropriated from us "without our concurrence" (Haynes 247). Since this natural decree was breached through enslavement, society could not lead a good life because some constituents were violently deprived of the chance to pursue their own conceptions and cultivate their talents. Indeed, the author posits that since people all belong to one species, the same regulations should be applied to everyone without granting advantages to specific groups (Haynes 246). However, not only external influences can hinder one from attaining a virtuous goal. In reality, an individual's apprehensions and biases, which are delineated as shadows in Plato's Cave, may impede someone from learning and evolving. Overall, a good life is feasible if all individuals possess the liberty to seek knowledge and apply it because everyone will be yielding equally beneficial outcomes. Still, even parity and freedom may not safeguard someone from floundering to become better if one's mentality is flawed.

In conclusion, Haynes and Wollstonecraft employed the framework of enslavement and women's rights, respectively, to broach the subject of liberty. Assessing their works and the tone they employed in their writings enabled me to perceive that equal rights, duties, and opportunities are imperative for society to attain a virtuous life. Furthermore, applying scrutiny to these readings aided me in realizing that emotional writings are as persuasive as rational elucidations as in the instance of Wollstonecraft's and Haynes's works. Indeed, Wollstonecraft's satirical demeanor arose from her indignation at men who deprived her of her inherent rights to pursue a better future. Haynes's treatise lacks irony, but the author is quite resolute that servitude must be eradicated.
