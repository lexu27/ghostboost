Preamble
Because of increasing meat consumption and diminishing farmland availability, developing alternative protein sources is urgent. As per Van Huis (2015), food security is achieved when all communities have physical, societal, and financial access to sufficient, safe, and healthier meals to fulfill their dietary needs for an energetic lifestyle consistently. On a global scale, meat consumption is expected to increase by 76% between 2005/2007 and 2050 (Van Huis, 2015). Hence, alternative protein supplements like duckweed, seaweed, cultured meat, and insects would signify a dietary change. This article seeks to critically evaluate the different sources of meat and their biochemical compositions. Furthermore, the paper highlights the benefits and drawbacks of edible insects as a protein source.
Meat Sources and Their Fundamental Composition
The diverse meat sources, as elaborated here, encompass beef, fish, pork, and poultry. Beef denotes the flesh of cattle, Bos taurus, and is categorized as red meat. It pertains to mammalian meat that contains more iron than fish or chicken (Michael et al., 2019). Beef is predominantly proteinaceous with varying amounts of fat. Animal protein is frequently of exceptional quality, encompassing all nine essential amino acids necessary for proper bodily growth and enhancement. Beef incorporates a variety of fats, commonly referred to as beef tallow. Water, protein, fat, and ash constitute the four primary constituents of fish's edible portions. Liquids act as a medium for the transportation of nutrients and molecules, with water comprising the bulk of these fluids. Lipids predominantly consist of triacylglycerol and phosphoglycerides in fish muscle, both containing nonesterified fatty acids (Kiczorowska et al., 2019). Protein is the second most prevalent component in fish myocytes, typically ranging between 16 and 18% (Kiczorowska et al., 2019). The protein content of fish tissues is influenced by feeding habits and reproductive cycles.
Pork signifies the meat of the domestic pig (Sus domesticus), and akin to all meat, pork is primarily constituted of protein. When dehydrated, lean pork boasts a protein concentration of up to 89%, rendering it one of the most protein-rich foods accessible (Adamczak et al., 2018). Similar to other types of red meat, pork is predominantly composed of saturated and unsaturated fats in roughly equal proportions, hence a significant protein source.
The major composition of poultry flesh encompasses copper, fat, water, iron, phosphorus, protein, and other essential nutrients crucial for proper digestion. Cooked poultry flesh contains approximately 25% to 30% protein, contingent on the carcass section and cooking technique (Gumułka & Połtowicz, 2020). Poultry flesh is highly protein-rich and is commonly acknowledged as a substantial source of high-quality protein, surpassing red meat in protein content.
Instances of Different Meat Sources
Venison
Further instances of potential meat sources include venison and chicken. Venison refers to deer meat, which is a form of red meat. Venison is a rich source of zinc and contains trace amounts of most other micronutrients. This meat is a high-protein fare with low fat and calorie content and B vitamins (Nagy et al., 2019). Venison meat is sourced from mammals that can graze naturally in their indigenous habitat. Chicken harbors valuable proteins, encompassing all nine essential amino acids present in animal-derived foods. Without the skin, chicken ranks among the leanest meats, especially the breast, with a fat content of about 2% (Chmiel et al., 2019). Additionally, chicken flesh contains primarily B-complex vitamins, including niacin (Chmiel et al., 2019). These vitamins are vital for sugar and fat metabolism and cellular health.
The Pros and Cons of Using Insects as a Protein Source
The nutritional advantages of insects vary based on diet, developmental stage, sex, species, habitat, and evaluation methodologies. On average, edible insects contain 35%–60% protein by dry weight or 10%–25% protein by fresh weight, surpassing plant protein sources like wheat, soybeans, and lentils (Kim et al., 2019). Insects furnish more protein than meat and chicken eggs at the upper end. Orthoptera edible insects such as crickets, grasshoppers, and locusts are notably protein-dense.
Additionally, societies that consume insects often associate them with numerous health benefits in addition to their nutritional value. For instance, caterpillar fungus exhibits immune-boosting and anti-cancer properties (Kim et al., 2019). Several studies on insect enzymatic hydrolysates have revealed their possession of antioxidant and anti-diabetic traits, as well as the ability to inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) (Kim et al., 2019). Hence, the therapeutic significance of insects should not be underestimated; thus, further exploration is warranted to fully unveil other clinical benefits.
While insects are consumed in many regions globally, this does not exempt them from triggering allergic reactions. Individuals sensitive to crustaceans should exercise caution when consuming them, as certain studies suggest that insects may provoke similar anaphylactic responses (Liceaga, 2021). In the animal kingdom, insects and crustaceans fall under the category of arthropods. Moreover, specific species of ants and bees carry toxins that can be fatal if ingested. Liceaga (2021) noted that the metabolic steroid content of particular beetle species poses health hazards to humans. Consequently, excessive ingestion of these insects could lead to health issues. There is a slight elevated risk of lead or arsenic contamination when insects are ingested.
Final Thoughts
In essence, entomophagy could offer a solution to the escalating global food security challenge. For instance, insects provide more protein than meat and chicken eggs, rendering them a healthier option. Nonetheless, despite their medicinal and nutritional benefits, overconsumption of certain species may pose health risks since some species contain toxic substances that can be fatal when eaten. Consequently, owing to the substantial health advantages associated with insect consumption, nations should embrace insect cultivation to offer an alternative protein source for their populace.
