Feminist morality is built on the beliefs that women’s subjection is morally inappropriate and that women’s moral encounters are as valuable as men’s. Vaughn (2019) asserts that the subsequent are the pragmatic goals of feminist morality. Firstly, feminist morality express moral criticisms of behaviors and attitudes that strengthen women’s rights. Consequently, the crucial aim is to offer morally rational ways to resist such behaviors and practices. Ultimately, the goal of feminist morality is to envision a morally excellent alternative that advances female empowerment. Feminist moral debate reappeared in the late 1960s, first among the general public and then in academic discussion, as part of a broader resurgence of feminist moral questions. On topics like abortion, justice and equality, household labor, sexual abuse, and obligatory heterosexuality, the first academic feminist concepts were expressed. Nevertheless, the term ‘feminist morality’ did not become widely used until the late 1970s or early 1980s (Vaughn, 2019). Conventional morality, feminists speculated, was more completely male-biased and required more radical reconsideration.
Furthermore, feminism is constantly involved in moral thought and discussion. According to Vaughn (2019), feminism is principally a normative viewpoint, and feminists themselves frequently challenge its significance. Lack of concern for women’s interests, disregard for women’s issues, denial of women’s moral agency, devaluation of feminine ideals, and depreciation of women’s encounter are all indications of feminist hurdles. Prioritizing women’s interests, regarding women as moral specialists or authorities, swapping male for female values, or deducing directly from women’s moral experience are all examples of how feminist morality has been typecast and perceived. Essentially, these stigmas are widespread and incorrect; feminist morality is far more comprehensive and inclusive than the misunderstandings imply. In conclusion, contemporary feminists are exploring new approaches to contemplating moral themes that are mindful of their specific distinctiveness and intrinsic shared value, such as shared humanity, justice, and neutrality.
