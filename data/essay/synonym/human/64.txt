The human brain is the most intricate organ and system in existence, which possesses a highly restricted regenerative characteristic making aging a significant factor in its decline. The suggested investigation aims to evaluate how neural progenitor cells replace and specialize into neurons and other cells of the brain to utilize them for therapeutic intentions. Working hypothesis: neural progenitor cells must be utilized as a therapeutic measure to decelerate or cease the aging process due to their rejuvenation and specialization capabilities.

The research delves into how neural progenitor cells specialize into various forms of mature neural cells, including neurons themselves. Pluripotent stem cells, or PSCs, are the prime candidates for in vitro production and cultivation of neural progenitor cells. There is a broad spectrum of phenotypes concerning the specialization process, which is why a stringent condition setting is crucial. The resource will be beneficial for exploring and discussing how neural progenitor cells can be used in practice since the study concentrates on in vitro mechanisms.
