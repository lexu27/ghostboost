Many devout individuals frequently exhibit bias at exceedingly high levels. There exists a notable correlation between faith and bias that necessitates consideration of the intricate religious essence and the bias target. Faith encompasses a multifaceted moral, societal, emotional, and cognitive framework (Rowatt & Al-Kire, 2021). Nonetheless, cognitive and societal facets are significant dimensions that ascertain in-group members and the elements of a threat in a worldwide religious perspective, thus the connection between faith and biases. Catholicism and Islam are highlighted to have a crucial role in religious biases.
Catholicism
Prejudice and racism constitute the potent manifestations of bias that the Catholic Church resists. Nevertheless, studies indicate that other Catholics have diligently worked to foster racist behaviors in the recent past. In response to this scenario, the Catholic Church has seized the opportunity to recognize its involvement and ethical deficiencies concerning such pressing matters. Since 1958, Rowatt & Al-Kire, (2021) the church has undertaken enhanced and consistent endeavors to address the inappropriate situation. Furthermore, the church’s reactions and the current sentiment regarding racism and discrimination, which encompass aims of numerous catholic factions, were established to foster an inclusive culture and counteract the ideology of racism. Pope John XXIII is renowned for influencing the Catholic Church's transformations since his introduction.
Muslim
According to Rowatt & Al-Kire, (2021), there have been noticeable higher levels of bias steadily escalating among and within Muslims in the recent past. The Muslim community, particularly the Arabian and American Muslims, frequently face discrimination from their fellow Muslims, thus encountering considerable tension. These factions have consistently encountered rejection by their religious community. Even more concerning is that their entry into other nations has subjected them to numerous hardships and challenges. All these occurrences stem from bias linked to individuals’ attitudes towards others in the Muslim community. Several efforts to halt or diminish prejudice have not yielded significant changes in this scenario. Consequently, the Muslims are accountable for the rising discrimination rate among their factions.
Media’s Function in Biases
Media possesses the authority and potential to modify individual attitudes, beliefs, behaviors, and other communal aspects. For a while, policy interventions have targeted and utilized media communications to influence and advocate sexism, such as gender-based violence (Anwar et al., 2020). Media shapes social norms through two impacts, specifically, societal and individual impacts. The data conveyed on media platforms fosters a mutual understanding of a norm concerning the societal impact. Moreover, it enhances social coordination as more individuals embrace the shared information, assuming that others have embraced similar information (Anwar et al., 2020). Consequently, media information concerning norms may sway individuals to concur with them according to the individual impact. Thus, the societal and mechanisms of the media on changing attitudes of violence against women, although the former mechanism carries more weight.
Social Identity Theory
A person’s sense of self-identification grounded on their membership in a group is denoted as social identity. Through affiliating with groups, individuals can cultivate a sense of pride and self-worth (McLeod, 2019). Racism can arise from biased perceptions among civilizations, and it can even culminate in genocide in its most extreme embodiments. The group to which we belong is termed the in-group, and that from which we are excluded is termed the out-group (McLeod, 2019). To comprehend and recognize entities better, we categorize them. To grasp the communal context, we similarly categorize individuals. We apply social classifications like black, white, Australian, Christian, Muslim, student, and bus driver because they are practical. By classifying individuals into a category, we can glean a lot about them, as evidenced with the bus driver.
In and out-groups
Appropriate conduct is delineated by in-group norms, yet this is only feasible if you discern who belongs to your group. An individual can be part of several distinct groups. In the subsequent phase, social identification, we adopt the identity of the group to which we have aligned ourselves. As a consequence of your association with a group, your self-worth becomes intertwined with group membership (Scheepers & Ellemers, 2019). Once we have labeled ourselves as members of a group and established an association with it, we tend to compare it to other groups. This is crucial to comprehend because once two groups identify as adversaries, they are compelled to vie for members to uphold their self-worth. Competition and animosity between groups emerge from clashing identities and resource competition.
Impacts of bias
When individuals are undervalued by others, their self-esteem diminishes, and they cease to progress; bias aids them in feeling less than fully human. It frequently results in harassment and other forms of bias as it nurtures a fear of potential outcomes at any moment and of what the future may hold. This can lead to a person taking their own life in distressing circumstances, in extreme cases, homicide. Individuals and entire cohorts may feel highly vulnerable, fearful, and inadequate due to racism and discrimination.
Significance of Stereotype Threat
When individuals are cognizant of a negative stereotype about their group, they are often anxious that their performance on a task would affirm other people’s perceptions of their group. Psychologists utilize the term "stereotype threat" to describe the state in which individuals are apprehensive about validating a group stereotype (Meuleman et al., 2019). For those exposed to stereotype threat, it can be discomfiting and distracting. This phenomenon is believed to be context-specific, with individuals experiencing it solely when confronted with a negative stereotype about their group. Stereotype research complements investigations on microaggressions and bias in higher education, aiding in a better understanding of the experiences of underrepresented groups (Liu et al., 2021). Essentially, women may opt to enroll in courses in other fields to evade the stereotype threat they encounter in math classes.
Real-World Predicament and Its Influence on Society
Climate change will exert a substantial impact on our students' lives, and there will not be a single issue that has a more pronounced effect on them than this one. They comprehend that this is a crucial matter that will influence nearly every aspect, encompassing weather, escalating seas, food and nutrition security, water quality, air quality, environmental sustainability, and much more (Gougis, 2020). Disparities in socioeconomic factors, growth prospects, housing, security, support services, and other variables exacerbate food insecurity. With 13 million young individuals residing in food-insecure households, nearly everyone knows someone who is regularly hungry (Gougis, 2020). Given the ongoing events sweeping the nation, violence is inevitable; while politically driven, it disproportionately impacts young people. Individuals can learn how to advocate, coordinate, publicize, and request assistance. They can also grasp that this is a complex issue with numerous potential causes and, perhaps most importantly, there is hope for progress (Meuleman et al., 2019). Sustainability is a universal concern that encompasses everything from energy to sustenance to resources, commerce, health, and so forth.
Approaches to Reduce Bias Level in America
Educate yourself about your locality, encompassing the resident groups, their interactions, and the historical incidents due to racial prejudice or racism, among other methods to mitigate bias. Documenting occurrences in your community that
