Utilizing cutting-edge technologies, ADNOC is preparing to implement its digital advancements across all areas of operations and production as soon as next year. An equally remarkable instance of the variety and versatility of artificial intelligence utilization is the prognostic capability of computer applications. The corporation is creating a computer that can analyze a substantial volume of extensive data and propose strategies for the company’s actions based on the prediction. The creators of software for ADNOC aim to construct a machine that would operate according to a specific principle but also offer the potential for efficient data interpretation. Consequently, within the organization, a robust program was devised not solely for material processing but also for its visualization. By utilizing more accessible visual mediums to communicate intricate information, the advancement renders the future and current state of the company more perceptible and comprehensible.

The application of computer technologies in the expansion of a sizable corporation is evident at all tiers of its presence. ADNOC employs computer simulations to enhance the efficiency of the network chain and illustrate data for a clearer insight into the company’s status. All these innovations are integrated into each of the sectors of the company’s functioning, heightening the pace of execution and the efficiency of actions that are more advantageous. Their initiative to digitize and modernize all kinds of domains of the company’s operations is expected to be fully realized in 2022 (ADNOC, 2020). This emphasizes the firm’s dedication to foreseeing and adjusting to the forthcoming changes. The company aspires to devise a predictive framework that would encompass the most extensive array of statistical data.

The outcomes of big data processing reveal that ADNOC has notably hastened the pace and the quantity of financial transactions through its software. Based on the rationale of escalating the money turnover, one can deduce that this software enhances the financial performance of the company. Furthermore, it should be pointed out that within the accelerated money exchange system, an advanced blockchain technology is utilized, ensuring a continuous digital currency transfer. The software's capacity to make astute business decisions is already mirrored in its $1 billion worth of shares (Arabian Business, 2020). The diverse prospects for financial enrichment facilitated by this software are potentially vast.
