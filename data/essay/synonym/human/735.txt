Major League Baseball (MLB) athlete Tyler Skaggs passed away several years ago. He was discovered in his team hotel room in Texas, suffocating on his vomit, on July 1, 2019. The primary reason for his death was determined as “an intoxication from the substances,” which included fentanyl, oxycodone, and alcohol. Fentanyl is a rapid-acting opioid, which is 50-100 times more potent than morphine and 30-50 times stronger than heroin. This opioid medication is frequently utilized in medicine to control severe pain in cancer patients and perioperative pain. However, it is also used outside of medical settings and often results in fatal overdoses. The situation of Tyler Skaggs acts as a reminder of the issue that is critical in the United States currently – the opioid crisis.

The opioid-connected fatalities are not new, and one of their causes is illegally produced and distributed opioid medications. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) is accountable for decreasing “the Aggregate Production Quota (APQ) of opioids each year since 2017.” According to the DEA’s 2020 report, the “total domestic opioid production has decreased by 53% since 2016.” Nevertheless, the number of deaths from opioid overdose continues to rise, and Skaggs’s death is one such instance. Since the baseball player did not receive the drugs from his doctor, the DEA commenced an investigation into his overdose-death in general and the origin of the medications in particular.

The DEA is responsible for the health and safety of American communities and neighborhoods. That is why the organization is engaged in investigating Skaggs’s death. The primary objectives of the DEA are to recognize and impact the sources of illicit drugs and lessen drug-related violence. Additionally, it aims to support and contribute to local drug use prevention activities and bring justice to the families of individuals who passed away because they were unaware of the drugs they used. Consequently, the DEA established the Overdose Justice Task Force to look into opioid-related deaths, most of which were caused by fentanyl. Since Skaggs’s death was likewise caused by a fentanyl overdose, the DEA intervened in his case and initiated its investigation.

While the reason why the DEA is participating in Skaggs’s death inquiry is evident, how it is involved remains unclear. Thus, federal law enforcement agents interviewed other team members, friends, and relatives of the victim, attempting to uncover how the man acquired the drug. The investigation revealed that fentanyl was found everywhere, “even in marijuana.” Therefore, the DEA began collaborating with law enforcement to decrease domestic opioid production and drug-related deaths. The organization’s probe led to Eric Kay, who worked in the communication department of the baseball team where Skaggs competed. The man was accused of providing Skaggs with fake drugs containing fentanyl that caused the player’s death and dispensing oxycodone and fentanyl since at least 2017. Although Kay’s guilt has not yet been proven, the DEA’s contribution to this investigation is substantial.

Skaggs’s death is a reminder of the ongoing opioid crisis in the U.S. This incident illustrates that the opioid epidemic is a societal problem linked with governmental ignorance and unwillingness or inability to resolve this issue. According to Fischer et al., illicitly produced and distributed synthetic opioid drugs, including fentanyl, have emerged in the past five years. They are distributed as fake prescriptions alongside other medications. Hence, neither consumers nor law enforcement can trace the source of such drugs. Consequently, the number of opioid-related deaths in the United States has climbed by 300% between 2013 and 2017. Most opioid-related deaths involve fentanyl, which is why the current drug crisis is labeled as a “fentanyl epidemic.” The U.S. government must comprehend the supply chain and expose illicit drug markets and producers to tackle this problem.

It is evident that the opioid crisis is a societal issue, and the entire society should strive to address it. Therefore, in Skaggs’s case, friends and relatives did not report any drug-related concerns prior to Tyler’s death. Also, MLB had never screened its players on opioid use before that incident, and it consented to add this screening to the drug policy only five months after Skaggs’s death. The questions arise: why did MLB not confront this issue earlier? Is it conceivable that no one noticed that Skaggs was in pain and required pain relievers? More research is needed to address these questions and identify the responsible party for Skaggs’s demise.

The opioid epidemic is a national issue that requires immediate management. Presently, people have easy access to prescribed and illicit opioid products, leading to misuse, overdose, and even death. If the DEA aims to alter the situation, it should collaborate with law enforcement and propose stricter regulations and oversight of opioid drug prescriptions. Furthermore, state and federal government agencies and health organizations should also tackle this epidemic by enhancing the existing regulations and policies and emphasizing pain prevention, not just treatment. Lastly, synthetic illegal opioid drugs entering the United States from external markets should be eradicated.
