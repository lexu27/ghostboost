A healthcare administrator is an individual who coordinates the activities of a specific number of workers in a market economy based on contemporary management techniques. They are an expert in overseeing and regulating procedures in the health enhancement and system. It is vital to take into account numerous subtleties associated with employees’ actions in the workplace to excel in this profession. A specialist in this domain can effectively supervise performers and inspire them based on the administrator’s wishes and objectives. The administrator establishes connections among individuals and assesses each worker's individual input to the overall outcome. There are two primary foundations of influence that motivate the performer to collaborate: personal and organizational (positional). Below is an explanation of these skills and the origins of their enhancement by administrators in healthcare institutions.
The origins of an administrator’s power base in the healthcare institutions on a personal aspect encompass the subsequent elements and facets. Primarily, a healthcare administrator possesses that form of guidance under a specific degree of schooling, knowledge, expertise, skills, and capabilities. The performer trusts in the influencer’s unique knowledge that will satisfy the subordinate’s requirements. This is the impact of logical faith in the leader's abilities. Secondly, the authority of the head to power is contingent on the degree of acknowledgment from subordinates. There is an aspiration to influence others, which is evident in the aspiration to bolster one’s reputation, provide consistent advice, and extend assistance (Gopee & Galloway, 2017). Thirdly, an administrator has access to the essential information and the capability to utilize it to influence subordinates. The authority of information can serve as a source of influence, both for the administrator and aides. Consequently, it is grounded solely on managing data and not on understanding the subject matter. Fourth, the head affects the conduct of subordinates through charisma and charm. An assistant consciously or unconsciously endeavors to emulate the leader because they aspire to emulate them.
The origins of an administrator’s power on an organizational (positional) basis involve the following constituents. A healthcare administrator in institutions must possess sufficient authorization to influence decision-making. For instance, they might employ the “carrot and stick” approach. As a means of impacting the outcome, a supervisor implements the strategy of rewarding in their undertakings, which facilitates reinforcing the legal rights of the authorities. Such authority is established by the degree of the formal appeal to management and exerts influence through positive reinforcement. The administrator also shapes the conduct of subordinates through rebukes, penalties, demotions, dismissals. Nevertheless, it is imperative to bear in mind that such force is wielded through fear, which curtails initiative and innovation. Occasionally, leaders create a scarcity of resources when they are unable to efficiently utilize other power sources intentionally (Mason et al., 2020). Through the administrator’s contacts, they also obtain the chance to influence others.
In conclusion, power signifies an opportunity to influence the behavior of other individuals and complements the official authorities of leaders. It is determined by the position the administrator occupies in the organization. This capacity guarantees stability, organization, and prompt resolution of issues within the framework. Every administrator in the healthcare system necessitates continuous enhancement of this attribute to accomplish the effective operation of the company. Power pervades the entire existence of the enterprise, buttressing its framework. Consequently, power is a fundamental requirement for the successful functioning of an enterprise. Without adequate power to influence individuals, the administrator will not be able to realize their objectives.
