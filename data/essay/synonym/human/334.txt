I believe that individuals form connections based on the risks and benefits of their interactions. An individual consciously or subconsciously evaluates the advantages and disadvantages of their actions and selects the most gratifying course. Currency, affection, authority, or societal approval are instances of tangible and intangible benefits and drawbacks (Cox et al., 2021). As relationships are built on rewards, each member of the community tends to seek greater benefits from a connection. People are not inherently moral or immoral; however, they are molded to acquire specific traits based on particular requirements. Individuals are compelled to work for essential needs like nourishment and housing (Cox et al., 2021). Others draw inspiration from personal, cultural, societal, or economic circumstances.
In this context, individuals are not inherently bad or good but incentivized by biological, societal, and economic elements. Individuals with prompt actions and flexibility utilize agility to optimize their capabilities. Individuals may also maximize their potential by embracing a constructive outlook on all occurrences and confronting challenges directly (Cox et al., 2021). Modern concerns like isolation, destitution, and uncertainties significantly impact human connections. Society must promote fairness, collaboration, and reverence among cultures and social factions to maintain authority and establish enduring relationships.
Governments have a duty to ensure economic and social safety for the populace. To ensure financial stability, the government in socialist doctrine establishes arrangements for equal income distribution among working individuals (Cox et al., 2021). Other communal provisions incorporate cost-free education, pension benefits, social subsidies, and accessible healthcare services in designated situations, such as maternal healthcare. Furthermore, states provide and assure the upkeep of public commodities and amenities like thoroughfares and safety. A state's duty is to shield its residents from internal and external conflicts (Cox et al., 2021). The government safeguards civilians from economic, social, and political onslaughts through regulations and legislation. I believe states should shield vulnerable demographics such as women, seniors, and young people by supplying complimentary services, work prospects, and incentives on specific goods and services. The government should also nurture budding aptitudes to aid in income generation, particularly among the youth.
The present government has initiated numerous initiatives that serve the well-being of citizens nationwide. For example, the universal education movement has benefited numerous individuals regardless of age, gender, and ethnicity. However, affluent persons and regions benefit more from the system compared to the indigent and average Americans. Some inadequacies involve the health and safety of the common citizen. The government allocates substantial funds to internal and external security, yet many neighborhoods live in constant dread due to violence and insecurity. I think the capitalist economic framework is suitable for the State. Nevertheless, it requires adjustments in the workforce concerning individuals with less competitive skills. For instance, offering alternative job opportunities to vulnerable groups such as the emotionally and physically unstable. My ideal State encompasses equality and democracy in disseminating social and economic amenities to cultivate a robust and content citizenry eager to enhance the economy through diligence and dedication.
My perspectives are influenced by Josephine Shaw Lowell, a social laborer during the 19 th era. Lowell is renowned for her philanthropic deeds and overhaul in social labor. She perpetually upheld and advocated for parity while aiding vulnerable groups. Despite originating from an affluent lineage, Lowell perceived the trials and tribulations of minority factions and dedicated her life to setting up institutions and reforms in social amenities. She held a pragmatic outlook on society where the affluent and powerful continue to prosper despite the lower members' endeavors. Her impetus stemmed from empathy and readiness to sacrifice to better the impoverished, ailing, and mentally troubled lives through enhanced education, healthcare, and hygienic penitentiaries. Since governmental schemes were not involved in most aspects of citizens' welfare at the time, Lowell took it upon herself to effect a change. I aspire to emulate her path of creating a more refined society through social labor and governmental reforms in the field.
Sexual preference, gender, class, and ethnicity are notable predictors of social attitudes among populations. These aspects may obstruct effective communal aid at institutional and personal levels. Individuals grappling with sexual preference may hold differing perspectives on communal amenities, such as reconciling social engagements (Cox et al., 2021). Ethnicity and race can also impede fieldwork since most vulnerable factions hail from minority racial groups and may pose hurdles during communication and general interactions. When addressing weighty matters affecting their communities, the factions may display xenophobic sentiments and unsavory conduct (Cox et al., 2021). Engaging in personal experiences and opinions is demanding when people harbor contrasting impressions of one another. Nonetheless, social labor entails adept interpersonal abilities, which I possess and will employ.
The liberal principle dictating accessibility to quality amenities and welfare when necessary bolsters social labor principles of effectively serving the community. It enhances the practice by providing global proficiency and institutional empowerment, which enhances service provision. Nevertheless, liberalizing the social labor market may impede successful service delivery (Cox et al., 2021). Social laborers operate under the morals of honesty, social fairness, and communal progression among all demographics. Establishing dominance by vending social labor amenities portrays an economic-focused approach grounded in self-interest rather than communal advancement. The liberal stance discourages client discretion since procuring amenities operates on the terms and conditions of the buyer (Cox et al., 2021). Consequently, prioritizing monetary gain in social labor may obstruct service delivery as clients may withhold selective information since they are remunerating for the amenities. Alternatively, the liberal approach can hinder aiding impoverished communities as they lack the financial means. I foresee encountering hurdles while collaborating with the vulnerable community due to the relative scarcity of resources on either end.
