The Roman Empire was primarily polytheistic, implying that individuals recognized and revered several different deities. They believed that these beings played a role in the development of Roman civilization and influenced the occurrences of individuals’ daily lives (Bartsch, 2020). Due to Rome’s geographical position, its populace had frequent contact with Greek populations who had extended their dominion into the Italian peninsula and Sicily (Beard, 2015). Many aspects of Greek culture were adopted by Rome, with slight adjustments to suit their needs.
As per Polybius' interpretation of the Roman government, the monarchy was solidified in the position of the Consul. The stories of Manilus Hippomanes, Olivier de Noyen, and Julien Barneuve are intertwined through history in The Dream of Scipio by a philosophical reflection asserting that man is responsible for his actions' own salvation, but solely through comprehension, not through deeds or belief (Ruden, 2013). Rome had two secretaries, each overseeing sections of the Roman army and possessing the power to convene assemblies and propose different measures before the Senate; they were lauded annually.
Citizenship in Rome was a complex concept that varied based on one’s sex, lineage, and standing in society. Men were the sole individuals eligible to obtain complete citizenship. A child born of a lawful union between a citizen father and a citizen mother would be conferred citizenship through lineage (Beard, 2015). Citizenship in the United States can be acquired through birth or registration. Individuals are typically born U.S. citizens if they are born in America or born abroad to U.S. citizens. They may also acquire U.S. nationality as a minor through the union of one or both parents.
