Principally, one should observe that the nation that I selected to complete the task is France. Certainly, there are numerous embassies of France in the United States. Nonetheless, to transport the remains to the "native land," it is necessary to contact a specific embassy general situated in California, Los Angeles. In this scenario, a "griever" must schedule a meeting in the office with an expert two days beforehand to go over all the particulars and aspects concerning the dispatch of human remains and sealing an urn (Shipment of cremated remains, 2019). Consequently, the Embassy General of France in Los Angeles is one of the most pertinent locations to seek assistance to eliminate "leftovers."
Accordingly, I must supply the subsequent goods to the family in the future. First and foremost, it is vital to assemble a package of specific documents. For example, they consist of a death record of a cherished one in the US, a medical statement, and a certificate of cremation and sealing. Additionally, an attestation of the lack of foreign attachments and sealed closure of the urn, a certificate of the absence of contagious illnesses from the deceased, and authorization to import remains will be necessary. It is also crucial to have an individual's approval to solicit repatriation and an accredited French translation of the death and cremation certificate. Secondly, this family requires an urn with the ashes of the deceased, placed in a specialized airtight container.
Additionally, there are not overly intricate stipulations concerning the conveyance of the urn in France. An individual must directly contact the French embassy in the US and compile a package of documents outlined above. There are numerous airlines involved in the conveyance of ashes, one of the most dependable and renowned is Air France-KLM. Typically, the time frames are established based on an accord between funeral firms in America and the target nation.
The embassy representative I had to interact with is Julie Duhaut-Bedos. Moreover, the flight reservation service would be accompanied by the embassy's aid. Depending on the distance, it is crucial to reserve a non-stop flight or with a layover. Furthermore, each airline presents specific terms for the transportation of special cargo. The urn with the ashes of a cherished one would be securely sealed and positioned in a specialized lockable box with sturdy walls. Conveying the loved one by aircraft is viable solely in the cargo hold.
