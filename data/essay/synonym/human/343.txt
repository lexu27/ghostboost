The scholars derive their conclusion from three well-constructed case analyses concerning different software applications. These studies involve assessing bone fractures post traffic collisions, bone traumas from a shovel, and bullet injuries to the skull, yielding valuable insights for enhancing current forensic inquiries (Buck et al., 2008). The simulation software and tactile device employed in the research exhibit high accuracy, minimal resistance, exceptional authenticity, and a six-degree freedom output capability. These are advanced specifications for such discussions in today's world. Nonetheless, duplicating the investigation to confirm the outcomes might pose a difficulty due to the steep expenses of assembling all the specimens and gear utilized in the process (Pinzon et al., 2016).

The researchers appropriately infer their interpretations and decisions from the compiled information encompassing the three distinct case studies mentioned earlier. The outcomes of the research suggest that tactile devices can be extremely beneficial in posthumous and forensic inquiries. In forensic science, the study can play a crucial role in enabling examiners to reconstruct a crime scene (e.g., gun-holding posture) and pinpoint the item utilized in the offense with improved accuracy and speed. Hagmann et al. (2021) thus observe that integrating haptics in forensic science can expedite the criminal justice procedure and enhance the trustworthiness of investigations.

The investigation is deeply innovative as it facilitates the utilization of technology to reconstruct crime scenes and allows the user to perceive touch sensations often absent during such virtual ventures. Consequently, the user can interact with and experience 3D digital data, which signifies groundbreaking innovation and enhances current technologies. According to Joukal et al. (2015), there might be disputes concerning the utilization of haptics due to concerns about tampering with operating systems and online breaches to manipulate investigation results. Such risks could affect the credibility of these devices in legal proceedings. Ethically, the devices render investigations more costly to execute due to expensive equipment and personnel training (Fahrni et al., 2019). These costs could impede the pursuit of justice in certain situations, particularly in impoverished regions. Nevertheless, the innovation is evident, and the researchers aptly draw firm conclusions based on their three well-structured case studies.
