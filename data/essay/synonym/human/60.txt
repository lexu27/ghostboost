Synopsis
Bacillus anthracis, a severe respiratory sickness, is pushing air currents out of Midwesterners, sending many individuals to the physicians' clinics. The sufferers are wheezing and gasping for air, and more individuals are contracting the illness. Scientists initiate the inquiry by conversing with Zeke, who was the initial victim to discover what he used to be before falling sick. Zeke mentioned that he started wheezing and feeling extremely fatigued shortly after directing a soundtrack training session for 50 participants at a Chicago music place. He suspected he had acquired the sickness from one of the learners in the classroom or that he had caught it on a return flight from Africa two days earlier. The factor accountable for the outbreak is highly likely to have been released at the music festival.
Factor Responsible for the Breathless Outbreak in the Midwest
Anthrax is a hazardous ailment caused by the bacterial Bacillus anthracis. Anthrax is not contagious. Individuals cannot acquire it from another person in the same manner one might catch a severe cold. Anthrax can be typically found in soil usually and can infect domestic and wild animals such as livestock, sheep, and goats (Figueiredo, 2019). When living organisms ingest spores (bacteria) from contaminated soil, they often become ill. People can contract Anthrax by handling diseased animal protein or inhaling anthrax spores from animal products. People can also contract Anthrax by consuming raw meat from infected animals or being exposed to pathogens by bioterrorists.
Summary of the Situation
The outbreak occurred at various sites in the United States; Chicago, Wisconsin, Illinois, and Milwaukee. A total of fifteen individuals were infected, and emergency centers registered fifteen hospitalizations (CDC, 2022). Furthermore, there were seven documented fatalities among the outbreak victims. These individuals have visited emergency departments in the past two days with symptoms of slight fever, fatigue, chest constriction, heart palpitations, and respiratory issues. Many deaths have already happened, and more individuals are on the verge of death.
Present Status of Breathless in the U.S
The circumstance in the United States is deteriorating day by day. There has been an unexpectedly large number of children with coughs, colds, and respiratory problems this season (Denny et al., 2018). This is according to Rachel Wolfson, an acute inpatient general practitioner who treats sick individuals at the University of Chicago's Comer Children's Infirmary, where the eleven Illinois cases were identified (CDC, 2022). Wolfson clarifies that some of the children she treated only needed nasal spray treatments, while others were much more unwell (CDC, 2022). The lungs of one patient were in such a terrible state that medical personnel had to attach them to a blood oxygen generator.
Epidemiological Triangle
In this part of the study, the concept of disease transmission among the agent, host, and environment, also known as the epidemiological triangle, is unveiled. Anthrax is a lethal infectious disease caused by Bacillus anthracis, a gram-positive, rod-shaped pathogen. It is naturally present in the soil and often affects both animals and food globally. Fungal spores of the disease can survive in the soil or animal feed, such as dried or treated animal skin and wool for centuries. Spores can also remain viable in water for at least two years, dairy milk for a decade, and silk fibers for up to seventy-one years.
Anthrax can make individuals unwell if they come into contact with contaminated food or infected animal protein. Wild or domestic animals, such as sheep, cattle, horses, and cows, are common hosts for Anthrax, as defensive antigens from anthrax toxin target receptor molecules. Bacillus anthracis, a spore-forming bacterial infection that can persist in harsh environments for extended periods, causes Anthrax. When the pathogen enters a mammal's immune system, the spores germinate, rapidly spreading pathogens throughout the bloodstream.
Actions that Community Health Nurses Can Take to Prevent Recurrence
Patients with localized cutaneous Anthrax who do not have institutional involvement or complications can be treated as outpatients with standard antibacterial therapy. Individuals potentially exposed should wash with soap and warm water instead of detergent solutions; clothing and evidence should be placed in three plastic bags. If pathogens are confirmed, a 1:10 dilution of household bleach can be used to disinfect any items or surfaces not adequately cleaned by soap and warm water.
Upon the identification of a disease case, community health authorities and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention should be notified of reported issues. Additionally, consultation with an infectious diseases specialist may be warranted, although diagnosing patients with Anthrax is relatively straightforward. Individuals can reduce their risk of Anthrax infection by receiving immunization. The BioThrax vaccine is the sole FDA-approved anthrax immunization. It is a five-dose vaccine series administered over an extended period when used as a preventive measure. Products suspected of containing biological agents are subject to special monitoring by the government.
