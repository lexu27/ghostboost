In his vivid novel, Spiegelman utilizes a literary mechanism called personification to illustrate the contrast among races, including Americans, the Germans, and the Jews. This mechanism simplifies the grave matter for better comprehension, and the audience focuses more on the concepts conveyed by the writer. In Maus, Spiegelman depicts the atrocities of the holocaust and reminds the audience that the victims and survivors of the holocaust also had their individual lives and aspirations.
The initial segment to be examined is Chapter 1 – “The Sheik.” In this part, the primary character Artie requests his father Vladek to narrate to him about his life during the conflict. Instead of recounting the horrors Vladek encountered during the holocaust, he chooses to inform his son about his joyful and carefree life in 1935 (Spiegelman, 1980, pp. 13-23). This inclination to reminisce about the bygone days demonstrates that the casualties of the conflict prefer to recall the pleasant moments.
The subsequent segment is Chapter 3- “Prisoner of War.” In this section of the narrative, Vladek discusses the initial incidents he witnessed as a soldier. Interestingly, Vladek recollects the identity of a soldier he eliminated, and this detail indicates that even amid the dreadful events, one's mind captures the trivial and insignificant things (Spiegelman, 1980, p. 50). Ultimately, Vladek mentions that he was reunited with his family, and this occurrence holds more significance than what he encountered as a prisoner of war.
The third portion to assess is Chapter 5 – “Mouse Holes.” This part reveals that, for numerous mice, war is a sequence of challenging decisions that must be taken in order for them to attempt to survive (Spiegelman, 1980). Even when parents discover the demise of their offspring, they must maintain a rational mindset to evade detection by the cats.
To summarize, one might argue that this vivid novel is a distinct literary creation about World War II. In these comic illustrations, Spiegelman succeeded in illustrating the horrors of the holocaust and those insignificant yet meaningful things that sustained the victims and assisted some of them in staying optimistic. Despite the war being rife with brutality and killings, the writer depicts the paradox of the circumstance – the Germans are merely creatures who envision they are superior to others.
