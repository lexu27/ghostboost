In my African-American community, caregiver roles are typically taken up by women â€“ daughters, spouses, or daughters-in-law. Women are generally accountable for aiding the ill with their day-to-day activities, such as dressing, bathing, and cooking, while men's obligation is financial assistance. Nevertheless, the responsibility of caregiving usually does not rest on one individual; instead, numerous family members may collaborate in offering help to the unwell family member.
Overall, diverse identity traits define who assumes caregiving responsibilities. Gender is a crucial aspect since studies indicate that, although men can be involved in caregiving, women serve as caregivers much more frequently (Bertogg & Strauss, 2020). Moreover, men are more inclined to stay employed, which is why they often undertake financial support, whereas women help with daily activities (Bertogg & Strauss, 2020). Additionally, marital status also influences whether an individual will become a caregiver. Among married individuals, caregiving is prevalent, and if both partners encounter specific health issues, the caregiving duty falls on the one who is functionally less restricted (Bertogg & Strauss, 2020). Age could also impact caregiving roles as younger persons are more prone to becoming caregivers for their older relatives.
In the African American community, two primary factors could alleviate the caregiver burden. The initial factor is the high regard for the family and cultural anticipations regarding women's roles as caregivers for the family. Due to culturally ingrained female responsibilities and the higher significance placed on family requirements over individual ones, African Americans are less overwhelmed by caregiving (McLennon et al., 2020). Another alleviating factor is religiosity that is utilized as a source of solace and resilience (McLennon et al., 2020). Both factors aid African Americans in managing the caregiver's burden.
Interventions suitable for this cultural group should highlight African American principles. One specific intervention is psychoeducation that should be culturally customized to incorporate more details about the family as a caregiving asset (Brewster et al., 2020). Culturally mindful interventions are crucial as they permit the establishment of therapeutic relationships with clients and addressing the systemic oppression encountered by their cultural categories (National Association of Social Workers, 2010). To champion for African American caregivers, social workers must be cognizant of regulations relevant to this group and safeguard their concerns and cultural principles during team meetings. They should also endorse policies and media that strive to eradicate the institutional oppression of this group.
