Age discrimination is a worldwide issue of discriminating and stereotyping individuals based on their age. It leads to bias in society, resulting in a psychological impact on individuals and fostering prejudiced attitudes toward specific demographics (Ayalon & Tesch-Römer, 2018). The media frequently plays a role in stereotyping various age brackets, particularly senior citizens. This article seeks to explore two instances of age discrimination and one case of a favorable portrayal of the elderly in the media.

Clichés and stereotypes about senior citizens in marketing create unfavorable attitudes in individuals as they convey unrealistic and out-of-date messages to the public. For instance, "This Is Getting Old" is a commercial by E-Trade that illustrates senior citizens working jobs they dislike and are unable to perform because they have not saved enough for retirement (Advertising TV, 2018). This stereotypical video is age discriminatory as it reinforces prejudice and bias against older employees, individuals facing financial difficulties, and the elderly in general. Another illustration of age discrimination is a commercial, "Dear Young People, Don’t Vote," in which senior citizens advise the younger generation not to vote (NAIL Communications, 2018). This video is age discriminatory as it depicts the elderly as a self-centered, apathetic, and uncaring group, which is inaccurate and discriminatory. A positive instance includes a commercial by DocMorris, where an elderly man consistently exercises to lift his granddaughter to assist her in placing a star on top of the Christmas tree (Sport for Business, 2020). This video is respectful, encouraging, and heartening as it portrays an elderly individual who can accomplish objectives and lead a gratifying life.

In conclusion, age discrimination has negative repercussions on the image of senior citizens in society. Unfavorable portrayals of the elderly in the media discussed in this article diminish the capabilities of senior citizens. Furthermore, they foster negative perceptions towards aging in society, despite the fact that this is a natural process. Nonetheless, there are also positive instances not tainted by age discrimination. They do not propagate misconceptions and prejudice, aiding in cultivating a more positive and supportive outlook towards this demographic in society.
