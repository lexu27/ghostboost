As one peruses the Gospel, inconsistencies and occasionally even contradictions among the texts might be observed. Conversely, the portrayals of certain narratives in the Gospels are identical verbatim, as though they were transcribed by one writer from another. This occurrence is known as the synoptic issue in scholarly biblical studies and has been scrutinized for centuries. From the four Gospels, the writings of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John Chris are referred to as synoptic (Bakker & Jong, 2021). Numerous literary resemblances exist among these four texts, the examination of which will be outlined in this document.
To commence, it is worthwhile to deliberate on the similarities of the three authors – Matthew, Mark, and Luke. Broadly speaking, the arrangement of likenesses and variances among the Synoptics can be delineated as follows. Some of Christ’s deeds and lessons are recounted by all three evangelists, while others are narrated by solely two or one. Based on this, scholars have deduced that each writer of the Gospels shares identical material with the other two Synoptics or with any one of them and distinctly their individual content not present in any other (Bakker & Jong, 2021). For instance, the exclusive content of Mark’s Gospel is 30 verses out of over 650. Consequently, more than 600 verses from Mark are evident in the works of Matthew and Luke. Traditionally, the collective content in Matthew and Luke comprises approximately 240 verses. The unique content in Matthew is roughly 1/6 of the total, in Luke about 1/4 (Farrugia, 2020). Interestingly, both the exclusive content of Matthew and Luke and the entire content of both predominantly focus on the Savior’s words, not His deeds. The disparities in the evangelists' texts also stem from adhering to distinct traditions of recounting occurrences.
For instance, Matthew and Luke adhere to one tradition of retelling the parable of the laborers in the vineyard, whereas Mark adheres to an alternative tradition. Concerning John Chris, numerous episodes and teachings of Christ in the Fourth Gospel are a peculiar text distinctive solely to John. This is not to imply that there is no correlation between Synoptics and John, but it is not evident. Christ’s dialogues with Nicodemus and the Samaritan woman, the discourse regarding the bread that descended from heaven, the resurrection of Lazarus are not solely theologically significant passages cited exclusively in John (Gathercole, 2020). They are distinctive and crucial even in terms of the text configuration – comprehensive and intricate in comparison to the manner the Synoptics present the material. Concurrently, there is a discrepancy with the other evangelists concerning the day of Passover and the omission of the instant of the apostles’ communion in the depiction of the Last Supper. All of the above compels biblical scholars to pose the query of the association between the Gospel of John and the Synoptics beyond the synoptic issue.
One can infer that the writings of the three authors, Matthew, Mark, and Luke, are, for the most part, akin. Their primary distinctions lie in their utilization of diverse traditions of interpretation and retelling (Norouzi & Jalali, 2020). The texts of John Chris are notably distinct from the others because they contain fragments that are unique solely to this writer’s composition. Nonetheless, there are commonalities, such as recounting momentous events, which are consistent across all four authors.
