Synopsis

Aim
This article's aim is to explore the pathophysiology of intraoperative low blood pressure, focusing on the origins of hypotension at the cellular/receptor level.

Context
During surgery not related to the heart, intraoperative low blood pressure (ILBP) is a significant factor linked to post-surgery issues and increased mortality rates. The frequency varies based on how ILBP is defined by doctors and its reasons. Although there isn't a universal ILBP definition, physicians often refer to a mean arterial pressure below 65 mmHg. Despite differing definitions and symptoms of low blood pressure, a clear link exists between ILBP and various negative post-surgery results, including heart muscle damage, kidney issues, and other organ harm.

Findings
Recent studies have pinpointed several key reasons for intraoperative low blood pressure. These include reduced blood volume, widening of blood vessels, heightened pressure within the chest, poor heart output, and compromised regulation of blood pressure. These factors are triggered by anesthetic drugs and lead to reduced blood pressure. Risk elements include older age, past episodes of low blood pressure, urgent surgeries, and susceptibility to tissue damage. Although multiple factors contribute to intraoperative low blood pressure, more exploration is required on treating and managing ILBP during surgery. Patients undergoing non-heart-related surgeries under general anesthesia face risks of dangerous drops in blood pressure.

Pathophysiology of Intraoperative Low Blood Pressure
Introduction
Intraoperative low blood pressure is a common consequence of general anesthesia in surgery. Typically, ILBP is defined as a mean arterial pressure (MAP) below 25% of the patient's average value. Even brief MAP declines are tied to unfavorable outcomes. ILBP is a major factor in post-surgery complications like heart muscle issues, kidney problems, organ damage, and other critical conditions. Annually, over 8 million patients experience heart muscle damage post-surgery, a leading cause of early post-surgery deaths. Hence, ILBP significantly raises the risk of adverse post-surgery outcomes and mortality.

Occurrence
Studies show varying ILBP frequencies due to differing definitions. For instance, ILBP defined as a mean arterial pressure below 65 mmHg happens in about 65% of surgeries, while a 20% MAP drop from baseline occurs in 94% of cases. Studies reveal mortality rates ranging from 0.03% to 5.6%, with acute kidney injury rates between 2.8% and 72%. Additionally, myocardial injury after ILBP varies from 0.09% to 30%. Although low blood pressure is a strong indicator of adverse outcomes, the duration of low blood pressure episodes lacks a precise definition.

Causes
Detecting the causes of intraoperative low blood pressure is crucial to avoid severe post-surgery consequences. The mechanisms leading to ILBP differ across surgery phases under general anesthesia. Post-induction and early intraoperative low blood pressure phases result from intravenous anesthetics and other anesthetic drugs.

Patients under general anesthesia can experience low blood pressure due to various physiological mechanisms, revealing a range of ILBP causes. Common causes encompass blood vessel dilation, decreased blood volume, weak heart output, chest pressure elevation, and impaired nervous system function or blood pressure regulation. Blood vessel dilation reduces systemic vascular resistance and boosts blood flow, lowering blood pressure. Vasodilation, especially venodilation, mainly triggered by anesthetic drugs, can result from blood loss or inadequate blood vessel expansion. When compensatory mechanisms fail, relative blood volume decrease can lower arterial pressure.

Diminished heart output can result from slow heart rates causing conditions like low stroke volume. High heart rates can reduce stroke volume by shortening ventricular filling time. Ventricular fibrillation can nullify cardiac output, leading to low blood pressure. Baroreflex failure following procedures like radical neck dissection can also prompt low blood pressure. Baroreflex failure, besides orthostatic hypotension, can lead to acute or fluctuating hypertension. Risk factors for intraoperative low blood pressure include advanced age, prior low blood pressure episodes, emergency surgeries, and tissue damage vulnerability.

Indicators and Symptoms
Patients under anesthesia during surgery may not display typical low blood pressure signs like dizziness, nausea, or blurred vision. Physicians rely on defined low blood pressure thresholds to gauge safe blood pressure levels during surgery. Although intraoperative low blood pressure definitions vary, values below a mean arterial pressure of 65 mmHg are considered perilous, leading to post-surgery complications and death. Such low blood pressure can cause lasting organ damage by depriving vital organs of blood.

Conclusion
In summary, while the causes of intraoperative low blood pressure are recognized, preventative measures and treatments remain unclear. ILBP is a significant warning sign of adverse outcomes and high post-surgery mortality rates. Hence, future research should delve into management strategies.
