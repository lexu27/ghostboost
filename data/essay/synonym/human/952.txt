From the discourse, I uncovered that the term republic partially stems from the term demes which denotes the small division of the larger sections that Athens was split into during the ancient period. The latter portion of the term is the Greek term Kratos which signifies the governance. Correspondingly to contemporary times, republic signifies the governance of the populace, which suggests that the inhabitants of a specific region's crucial political determinations are made collectively. Nonetheless, there are also two primary distinctions between Athenian and contemporary republics. 

The primary and most evident contrast between the two frameworks is who was viewed as eligible to cast a ballot. In Athens, solely grown men could influence the city's political and administrative resolutions, whereas women, kids, and enslaved individuals did not possess this privilege. Despite the fact that most contemporary nations also do not permit underage involvement in the electoral process, women and grown-ups of all strata are entitled to officially express their civic wishes. Therefore, it can be deduced that present-day republics are usually more comprehensive and representative than ancient ones. 

Furthermore, the prevailing majority of contemporary republics are representative, whereas, in ancient Greece, they were direct. It implies that while inhabitants could directly vote for proposed statutes and foreign strategies formerly, individuals presently must elect representatives who would formulate legislative and policy-oriented determinations for them. Despite the fact that the original Greek approach may appear more equitable and appealing, it is imperative to recognize that, nowadays, this method would be almost unattainable. Indeed, in Athens, for instance, solely about 30,000 occupants had voting privileges, whereas today, most nations have a populace that is tallied in millions and even in billions of citizens. Due to this, it becomes evident that voting for every bill would be connected with immense temporal and monetary investments in contrast to a representative system. 

Nonetheless, in a nutshell, it can be contended that the essence of contemporary republicanism is not distinct from the one in ancient Greece. The notion that proclaims that individuals can and should be the possessors of political authority still endures unchanged. Despite the fact that there are some disparities between the antique and the contemporary systems, they instead mirror the progression of society rather than modifications in the principal tenet of republicanism.
