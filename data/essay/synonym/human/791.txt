An organizational arrangement is a framework that specifies how various operations within an enterprise are coordinated to achieve its goals. Joseph and Gaba (2020) stated that these operations may involve regulations, positions, and responsibilities. Moreover, the management chart influences how information moves between firm levels. In a centralized system, for example, decisions flow from the top down, but decision-making authority is distributed across multiple organizational levels in a decentralized model. The company structure allows businesses to maintain efficiency and focus. A growth strategy enables businesses to expand their operations by adding new locations, investing in customer acquisition, and broadening product lines. Consequently, a companyâ€™s expansion strategies are influenced by its sector and primary audience.
