Every enterprise must be managed cautiously, and every detail must receive a fair share of attention. When it pertains to healthcare, such facilities must demand even more attention because they concentrate on people’s well-being. Carrying out such responsibilities might be arduous and costly, as well as mentally taxing. As a Chief Nursing Officer, one will be confronted with principles that encompass integrity preservation, cash flow control, and employee encouragement in the specified circumstances.
To commence, a healthcare enterprise must always uphold its integrity. It can be apparent that any business sector should be focused on communication, which renders integrity a crucial component (Fisher, 2008). In the specified facility, the integrity preservation principle is strongly adhered to. Primarily, every physician abides by an ethical code, signifying that they are aware of doctor-patient confidentiality. Additionally, physicians and nurses emphasize truthful communication with patients. For instance, in my scenario, I inform patients about their actual conditions and candidly respond to their inquiries.
Another vital business principle is appropriate cash flow management. A healthcare facility necessitates refurbishments and advancements, implying that there will consistently be circumstances when new equipment or repairs will be essential (Mason et al., 2020). In this scenario, it is exceedingly vital to execute the necessary changes to avoid endangering patients’ health and well-being. For instance, as a CNO, it was my duty to oversee the substitution of power generators. Consequently, the generators allowed the staff to fulfill their obligations without disruptions during a storm and power outage.
The final principle is the supervision of employees and offering them with motivation. In the instance of a healthcare facility, it is imperative that the employees are acknowledged and their hard work is valued. The employees are granted additional days off and gift vouchers in the specified facility. This can make the workers feel listened to and supported. Without these measures, the nurses and physicians will experience burnout and lose the drive to deliver high-quality outcomes.
Hence, the specified principles were chosen due to the influence they can have on employees and patients. The discussed principles are being implemented, yielding favorable outcomes and leading to the contentment of all parties. These principles are significant to me since I am convinced that healthcare should be grounded on these principles. Otherwise, no facility will be capable of caring for their patients, and there will be no reliance and regard between healthcare staff and patients.
