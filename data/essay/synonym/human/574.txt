Social movements are primarily linked with their leaders, who embody the aspirations for change that require to be implemented. Charisma and leadership qualities are crucial to enable individuals to either succeed or fail in communicating their messages to the general public. Two leaders to be contrasted in this article are Martin Luther King Jr., who was the head of the movement for black rights, and Alicia Garza – the founding member of Black Lives Matter.
In Dr. King’s address, he discusses his vision of the future for black individuals. His speech is filled with faith-based rhetoric, affirming it to be not just a human but a divine entitlement for individuals to be equal (Rare Facts, 2017). In his vision, individuals of all hues and racial backgrounds would coexist in the USA of the future as equals, instead of facing oppression. Alicia Garza’s speech is centered on the current events, rather than a glimpse of the future (Center for Constitutional Rights, 2015). She provides evidence about how black individuals and particularly women are marginalized in today’s white male-dominated society, how they earn less, perish more, and are incarcerated more frequently, among other things. Her speech concludes with an affirmation of who BLM is and what they stand for.
When comparing Dr. King and Alicia Garza, it is evident that King is a much more seasoned speaker. He is accustomed to addressing a larger audience and has a greater reservoir of practical experience to draw upon. His voice is resonant and exudes authority, with the initial part of the speech resembling an epic tale, while the latter gradually evokes a stirring emotion from all those listening to it (Rare Facts, 2017). Alicia Garza’s speech aims to enlighten the public primarily. It is replete with facts and figures, and she seems to grapple with remembering all the statistics. She frequently refers to her notes to jog her memory (Center for Constitutional Rights, 2015). Her fervor is apparent in her voice and actions, but overall, she gives the impression of a student delivering a presentation in front of a class. Although they both address a predominantly black and supportive audience, a significant contrast is that King’s speech concentrates on men, while Garza’s focuses on women.
The venue selected by Dr. King was a church at the Lincoln Memorial. It was a symbolic location for several reasons – first, it provided a sense of order and sanctuary owing to its status as a place of worship. Second, it aided in conveying the message in two ways, by alluding to Lincoln’s struggle to emancipate the slaves, and to the divine decree that all men were created equal (Greenberg & Page, 2020). Alicia Garza’s venue resembles that of a TED Talk, with nothing particularly remarkable about it. However, Alicia benefits from social media to disseminate the message, which reduces the significance of the venue for mobilizing people and spreading the message.
Both speeches resonate well with the audience they are delivered to. King’s speech was witnessed not only by blacks but also by whites and Hispanics, who empathized with their plight. He unified them all as one nation under God. Alicia Garza’s words were primarily directed at black individuals (Center for Constitutional Rights, 2015). It was informative regarding the institutional and systemic injustices they encounter and urges these individuals to join their battle against injustice on a global scale. Overall, these two speeches had distinct objectives – King’s was a call to arms across the entire nation, while Garza’s was one of many speeches in an ongoing crusade for BLM.
