Executive Overview
Business Objectives: to leverage a decentralized parking system, to introduce safe payments, to enhance business openness, and to establish a digital leasing environment for all customers.
Leadership Strategy: to recognize contingencies, to gain endorsement from the city government, to distribute duties among vital staff.
Market Investigation: there are two trendy apps (Parkgene and Parkaide) that offer blockchain-based parking aid. The suggestion employs non-fungible tokens as the primary source of competitive edge.
Promotion Strategy: the consumer profile for the present suggestion is a male or female vehicle operator aged from 18 to 40. Fresh clients will be discovered on social networks, via recommendations, and with the assistance of social network influencers and native advertising.
Functioning Strategy: sales (set financial milestones), promotion (draw individuals to the product), exploration and development (examine the market), operations (interact with more stakeholders), individuals (inspire locals to get involved in testing), monetary and management (expand the business and continually improve the blockchain system).
Activity Strategy: to create a decentralized platform for blockchain-based parking lots to prevent the problem of the app being disconnected; to execute real-time navigation to offer vehicle users with pertinent proof concerning available parking spaces close by; to inspect the blockchain network to introduce new transactions based on non-fungible tokens.
Final Outcome: the estimated budget for the suggestion is about $200,000. The bulk of financial funds are needed to cover employees’ exertions and marketing.
Business Strategy
Discovering a parking space is one of the toughest tasks that must be fulfilled by local residents and tourists across bustling urban areas. Besides the time required to help an individual find the finest parking space, they have to squander fuel to park their vehicle and prevent fines. With roughly 20 hours per year spent by an average driver to find a parking space, it can be considered safe to state that the issue needs to be resolved promptly (Yang et al., 2017). Additionally, there are numerous overpayments caused by unreasonably high costs for parking areas that result in an approximate revenue of $20 billion. The shortage of parking spots and their high price could be the two linked reasons contributing to an increased number of traffic accidents (Dzulkurnain et al., 2019). The failure to find a parking space swiftly could also result in extensive traffic congestion. From the existing proof, it is also evident that most governments cannot solve that issue by merely creating new parking lots and increasing the quantity of parking spaces across urban regions.
Business Objectives
The primary business aim of the present proposal is to promote the value of decentralized parking and introduce blockchain as one of the most effective tools intended to contribute to a transparent network. Blockchain could become a pivotal contributor to vehicle parking enhancements, as there are practically no restrictions to how it could be utilized in the process of creating a vehicle parking platform (see Figure 1). Blockchain-based data storage would assist in a real-time connection between respective sensors across parking facilities and the app developed to support blockchain parking. With the help of the Internet of Things, developers would have the chance to generate additional value by interpreting the data from the GPS signal and providing the best routes to the respective parking spaces. With added insights concerning the traffic conditions, drivers utilizing the system would have access to alternate routes. Blockchain technology would be the foundation of the project that guarantees data credibility during the journey. Hong Kong does not allocate excessive resources to blockchain and cryptocurrency on a national scale, so it is logical to take the first step and achieve the business objective of deploying decentralized, blockchain-based parking.
Another business goal pursued by the writer is to introduce safe payments and monetize parking lots in the most effective manners. The increasing impact of digital wallets continues to influence various businesses, so it is crucial to consider digital currencies and accept crypto payments (Howell et al., 2020). For instance, smart contracts could assist consumers in reserving a parking space in advance while providing the facility management an opportunity to conduct an initial check on the driver’s identity. In this manner, the facility would be obligated to verify the payment only if the customer complies with all the regulations and does not pose a risk. Regarding the process of monetization, the writer anticipates expanding the existing automotive solutions by granting consumers access to an intricate blockchain platform. Simultaneously, it would not be an app informing drivers of free parking spaces but rather a decentralized marketplace operating in real-time to connect vehicle users and parking providers. The rapid pace of technological advancement could be the primary reason why blockchain became the focal point of this proposal.
