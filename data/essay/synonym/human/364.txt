Introduction
One of Edward Said’s fundamental concepts in orientalism is that knowledge about the East is shaped via imagined constructions rather than objective facts. Said’s interpretation of orientalism envisions Western supremacy over Eastern cultures (Said 1981). Said notes that the global perception of the Islam community is significantly impacted by the newspapers, primarily from the United States, that feature orientalist depictions (Said 1981). This study investigates whether Said’s assertion that orientalism is prevailing in the Newspaper media is valid or not. The conclusion addresses the query; Was Said’s assertion that orientalism dominates the media valid? The newspapers’ establishments may be employing orientalism as a commodity to market to the public.
