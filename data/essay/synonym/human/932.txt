Any alteration in social life patterns holds the potential to influence criminal patterns. With Covid-19, although theft rates have decreased by 75 percent in certain areas across America, the rise of the virus has led to Coronavirus-related crimes (Deloitte, 2020). A substantial amount of criminal activities has shifted, and as technology progresses, some of the potential upcoming offenses will involve monitoring. Law enforcement agencies will face difficulties with legal obligations and privacy concerns in using vehicles that require law enforcement agency adherence (Fortenbery, 2016). Law enforcement agencies will need to control monitoring when carrying out data gathering and item transportation operations. Another probable criminal analysis concern will be DNA examination (Fortenbery, 2016). Technological advancements have integrated various existing methods in massively parallel sequencing (MPS). Through this process, the ability to sequence DNA has become more precise and efficient, and offenders might employ different types of evidence and methods to tamper with samples (Fortenbery, 2016). DNA processing advancements combined with expanded known sample databases will present future criminal analysis hurdles for law enforcement agencies.
One mobile app that links police departments with their constituents is SceneDoc, which empowers police officers to collect notes, examine constituentsâ€™ case files, give citations, and finalize FBR reports. The app delivers a quicker and more accurate experience, richer information, and improved police safety while on duty (inTime, n.d.). Another legal mobile app connecting police to their constituents is USCop which equips law enforcement officers with over 1,400 content pages on training articles, case law resources, accident investigation formulas, law enforcement training modules, and pill identifiers, among other resources (inTime, n.d.). The additional applications, by reference, encompass Miranda Warnings/Rights, PoliceOne App, First Aid App, Scanner 911, Notecam, InTime Scheduling App, Early Bird Alarm Clock, and Police Spanish Guide.
