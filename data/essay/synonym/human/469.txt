I have examined the videos Suggestions for job seekers: How to bargain your wage pt. 1 and Suggestions for job seekers: Guidance on personal branding pt. 2, which were beneficial for preparing job meetings. From the initial video, I discovered that it is crucial to display value and distinctiveness when requesting a salary increase, which is also relevant to the subject of personal branding (CareerBuilder, 2012). Specifically, one can utilize a similar method when putting in for a job, highlighting that they possess the abilities and concepts that the business might value. Another talent is adaptability; it is crucial to explore various possibilities when bargaining for something so that one can transform situations into mutually beneficial occurrences. The second video's emphasis was nearer to the theme of personal branding. Specifically, its essential information was that one must be truthful when introducing oneself to a corporation since it indicates whether the worker would be more content with their work (CarrierBuilding, 2013). The honesty alerts the employer that an individual is genuinely fitting for a job role and can perform their duties efficiently in the future. Therefore, the abilities to concentrate on are value establishment, bargaining, adaptability, and honesty. They are important since they make one an especially presentable individual for an employer. Furthermore, these skills are crucial for a leadership profession since they are constituents of a personal brand; in return, a manager's understanding of branding is mandatory. This data constitutes a portion of the skill set for an individual who intends to encourage and collaborate with individuals professionally. Hence, the discussed skills are necessary for individuals who themselves are to work together with workers and comprehend their value.
