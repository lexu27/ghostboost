The initial part of Replication of Life examines the issue from a feminist viewpoint of what it signifies to be a woman existing in a male-dominated community, while the latter part tackles how women of color are impacted by racism. Heung points out that it is a tale about mimicry and feigning to be false. Lora Meredith, a caucasian woman, widow, and aspiring performer, always pretends. The reason for this behavior is to evade the trouble of raising her only daughter, Susie, alone with very little funds. Although Lora challenges clich√©s by not allowing any man govern her or meddle with her triumph, she maintains the proper principles of a good mother.
Conversely, Susie's replication of life is how she pretends to be a daughter, accepting all the love and tenderness from someone other than her mother while simultaneously earnestly expressing her affection to a man whose love is unreciprocated. Another protagonist, Sarah Jane Johnson, spends her whole life impersonating, pretending to be white when she is essentially black. Annie Johnson, Sarah Jane's mother, is a black woman who lives her life with the perception of always observing herself through the perspectives of others.
Consequently, all these female personas are exemplars in their enactments. An exclusion is only Annie, who, although she lives under the refraction of someone else's viewpoint, nonetheless embraces the onus of the truth of what it signifies to be a black woman in a world that does not recognize race. However, in the instance of Lora, Susie, and Sarah Jane, genuineness is penalized in a male-dominated and anti-female realm.
It is remarkable that with her self-deceit, Sarah Jane confronts the constrictions of her character and a woman's function in those periods. Declining to be a genuine lady or a genuine black, Sarah Jane performs a series of impersonations throughout the movie. On one side, she fits the portrayals of a wealthy musician, which she presents for her white partner. On the other hand, she is a seductive vocalist for disreputable nightclub patrons.
