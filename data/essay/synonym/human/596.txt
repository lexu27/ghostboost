Examination dependability is one of the criteria for examination quality. It demonstrates how precisely the examination is ensured to measure the phenomenon under scrutiny. Dependability is typically established after the examination items have been examined, and the final examination form has been gathered; a distinct examination validation is carried out to ascertain it (Whiston, 2017). An examination can be deemed dependable based on two types of information. First, an examination is considered reliable if it is immune to interference. When the examination is conducted under various circumstances, it produces similar outcomes. Second, an examination is dependable if it is internally coherent (homogeneous). This means that there are no contradictions within the process itself, and the methodology for interpreting the outcomes is appropriately selected. Examination dependability is also closely linked to chance error.
Similar to any human activity, testing involves mistakes. The following varieties of errors arise in testing: oversights, organized, and chance errors. Chance errors occur when successive measurements of a constant attribute yield varying numerical values. When identifying chance errors, it is presumed that the evaluated attribute remains constant over time, and all deviations are due to measurement inaccuracies. The boundary between chance and organized errors is circumstantial. The overall error of any examination comprises errors of these two forms but in varying proportions. The relative importance of each error type is influenced by the examination's quality and the conditions of the evaluation.
Examination results invariably encompass errors, regardless of how meticulously the examination is conducted. Nevertheless, through the application of mathematical statistical methods, it is feasible to approximate the total examination error magnitude and leverage it to assess examination dependability. Without a statistical assessment of examination dependability, measurement outcomes cannot be deemed reliable. Consequently, examination dependability is a feature of the degree to which distinctions between test-takers mirror variances in test-takers' attributes and the degree to which they are a manifestation of chance errors.
