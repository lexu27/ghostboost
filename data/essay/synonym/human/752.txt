Tendencies and Alterations of the External Environment influencing the Company’s Marketing Strategy

Technology
Walmart utilizes blockchain, employing a distributed ledger technology, to establish an automated method to manage payments and invoices from its 70 outsourced freight carriers (Vitasek et al., 2022). It sought advice from DLT Labs, a trailblazer in deploying and developing innovative enterprise solutions via distributed ledger technology (Vitasek et al., 2022). Walmart’s choice to utilize blockchain technology enables it to offer its services to a large populace in Canada without errors in orders as this system is efficient, fostering loyalty among its users. Additionally, blockchain technology provides a secure environment for the company’s customers as each transaction has a unique identifier, eradicating potential issues with tracking. This effectiveness in order provision and tracking advances the company’s business, ensuring its customers have faith in it to supply their goods without any mishaps or payment problems.
Economic
Walmart Canada decided to invest $3.5 billion in 2020 (Walmart Canada, a, 2020). Over five years, it aimed to achieve significant growth to make the in-store and online shopping experience quicker, simpler, and more affordable for its customers (Walmart Canada, a, 2020). This results in a swifter and enhanced e-commerce experience and modern digital tools ensuring associates serve customers optimally. As the company’s business expands, especially with e-commerce and grocery showing remarkable growth, Walmart is unlikely to compromise on providing its iconic low price to customers. The company has established trust based on this in-store and online aspect. This investment would generate numerous Canadian construction jobs and foster new partnerships with Canadian technology organizations, further positioning Walmart as a beneficial force in the economy.
Environmental
Walmart faces various challenges, including an adverse reputation, intense competition, limitations in joint ventures and business acquisitions, and stringent cultural principles in foreign markets. For instance, Walmart has a poor reputation for pollution, as seen in 2019 when the company emitted 17.56m metric tonnes of greenhouse gases (Walmart Canada, a, 2020). This problem is detrimental to the company’s image, especially when sustainability and environmental protection are contentious topics for consumers. The company has declared its intention to address these climate impacts, creating a favorable image of a changing organization.
Competitive Environment
Giant Tiger
This is one of the largest discount stores in Canada and offers similar products to Walmart, making it a significant rival for the global store. It provides diverse products from hardware items to groceries, akin to its U.S.-based counterpart (Williston, 2021). Since 2005, the chain has expanded in the Greater Toronto Area, with over 200 stores operational across Canada. Additionally, Giant Tiger employs a low-price strategy akin to Walmart’s, further showcasing its ability to encroach on the latter’s market share as it is a local company with stronger customer loyalty. Giant Tiger focuses its recent marketing not only on reduced prices but on the freshness of its products and the enjoyment of shopping in its outlets (Lombardo, 2019). These aspects place it in direct competition with Walmart as it employs similar marketing strategies to attract customers.
FreshCo
One of Walmart’s primary competitors is FreshCo, an organization with an expanding market share due to recent openings of new locations (Toneguzzi, 2021). However, Walmart has promptly mobilized its resources to cultivate a robust online presence, enabling it to devise cost-effective methods to supply its customers with products while reducing the need to visit stores. FreshCo offers fresh, frozen, chilled products, daily baked goods, cheeses, and meats. Walmart’s low-price strategy differs from FreshCo, enabling it to operate at reduced prices that could harm FreshCo's profitability.
Costco
Lastly, Walmart also contends with Costco for market supremacy. Costco provides a narrower range of products to effectively promote and sustain low prices for high-quality products (Chen, 2021). Recognizing that low pricing is the most effective marketing approach, Costco trims its budget for HR and advertising. The chain strategically positions its warehouse stores, typically in suburban areas, to secure cheaper rental costs (Chen, 2021). Costco, much like Walmart, integrates E-commerce, which plays a pivotal role during the global pandemic (Chen, 2021). However, despite Costco’s significant investments in the company aimed at launching new stores, Walmart boasts more locations and can attract a larger customer base this way.
Walmart’s USD
Walmart has a unique selling proposition rooted in its ability to retain customers through brand loyalty and economical prices. It flourishes because it relied on economies of scale and could outlast competitors that could not sustain this low-profit strategy. Additionally, customers trust Walmart’s products as it has been operating in Canada since 1994 and is recognized as a household name (Walmart Canada, 2022). The company’s magnitude also enhances its stature as it has numerous branches across Canada, enabling it to offer swift and dependable services to its clientele.
SWOT Analysis
Strengths
  * Walmart can capitalize on its continuously growing sales with a higher profit margin than its rivals (Martínez et al., 2017).
  * The company possesses abundant knowledge of Canadians’ shopping behaviors based on decades of operations (Walmart Canada, 2022).
  * Moreover, it can function with minimal profit as it formulated this strategy to compete favorably in the market.
Weaknesses
  * Walmart operates in unexplored territory that necessitates technological advantages to sustain its market position (Stanwick & Stanwick, 2020).
  * With the numerous stores open in the US, the company’s reputation is at risk due to policy breaches and instances of gender and racial discrimination in the US, tarnishing its image in the view of Canadian customers.
  * Walmart’s tarnished image concerning climate change could paint it as a detrimental company, shrinking its customer base.
Opportunities
  * The company's vast size and customer base could lay a solid foundation for forging strategic alliances and partnerships with prominent brands and other global retailers.
  * It would also greatly benefit from reduced costs associated with physical locations, further enabling it to attain a substantial profit than it presently enjoys (Stanwick & Stanwick, 2020).
  * Furthermore, Walmart has the opportunity to amass a larger market share due to its online store, bolstering its market presence and customer base.
Threats
  * Walmart will need to demonstrate its business acumen to compete against major players such as Amazon.
  * Online stores are simpler to establish than brick-and-mortar stores, rendering the threat of new entrants relatively feasible.
  * Walmart employees are not trained to engage extensively with customers, which is a challenge that online stores must address to retain loyal customers (Stanwick & Stanwick, 2020).
Potential Implications
Walmart’s size and customer base would facilitate its rapid development of an online market share compared to its competitors. It should leverage this advantage to promote its business before it is too late. The organization should concentrate on digital expansion and promoting its products through an online platform as brick-and-mortar businesses falter.
Global Support
Walmart established an eco-friendly business in 2019 to diminish its carbon footprint and advocate for sustainable business practices. Its Project Gigaton is a worldwide commitment to reduce carbon emissions by
