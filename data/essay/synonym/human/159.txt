In numerous ideologies, some prototypes can be depicted as the ideal self regarding the way of existing one’s life. In Confucianism, such an individual known as junzi — a noble individual or gentleman — is a prevalent ambition (Yu-kit 223). The amalgamation of the utmost attributes that a perfect human should possess is an almost unattainable objective, yet one that is esteemed by many. This dissertation will delineate the Confucian gentleman and juxtapose this visionary prototype with Plato’s philosopher-king. This notion originating from the customary Chinese culture persists in its significance for society. Such an individual surpasses malevolent notions, acknowledges them, and counteracts their repercussions to the best of their capabilities (Yu-kit 225). Furthermore, the Confucian gentleman aids others to do so through the transmission of knowledge (Yu-kit 223). Yu-kit states that a noble individual, as per Confucius, must assume “a dual role of an exemplar and educator” (224). Virtues are the subsequent disposition of this person, and he displays them daily. The Confucian gentleman is the one who abides by the highest ethical standards and strives to aid others in achieving the realization of this objective. Plato’s philosopher-king harbors various similarities to this archetypal function. They both are inclined to exhibit specific favorable ethical attributes while addressing adverse ones through logic and rationale. He is essentially modest and composed and consistently pursues wisdom for the enhancement of society (Mark). Significantly, Plato’s model is more inclined towards education rather than embodying life as a role model for others. In summary, both functions possess specific attributes that characterize a noble individual adhering to ethical traits, such as benevolence, impartiality, altruism, and the pursuit of concord. Nevertheless, Plato’s rendition of an exemplary individual is a composed leader who prioritizes wisdom as the utmost value, while the Confucian gentleman is committed to upholding ethical principles first. They are both committed to uplifting the moral principles of other individuals through kindness and altruism.
