Being a global corporation with varied sectors, Coates Chemicals became interested in fuel manufacture due to the introduction of E10 fuel in the United Kingdom. The company has a range of sectors covering most consumer needs, from edibles and drinks to medicines. The desire for the bioethanol factory drove the company to build the plant and manufacture ethanol from glucose. This document outlines step-by-step safety instructions that facilitated the construction and ethanol production at Coates Chemicals.

After conducting a thorough feasibility study of the bioethanol plant, it was clear that 10000 terapascal of pressure was cost-effective for ethanol production compared to the feasibility of the current market. The company was erected next to River Trent. The primary reason for situating the plant near the river is to reduce costs in case water sources are distant from the bioethanol plant. The production and processing of ethanol require ample water in its procedures. Therefore, having an abundant water supply during manufacturing and processing is crucial. In addition to its dedication to the manufacturing and processing sector, Coates Chemicals has placed more emphasis on the company's sustainable growth. Consequently, this company is responsible for its actions to its diverse stakeholders, such as customers and vendors.

As part of the firm's goals to provide consumers with the right range of end products from the various sectors under Coates Chemicals, the company aims to accomplish the following targets by 2025. Initially, Coates Chemicals is committed to reducing energy and water usage by 20%. The decrease in water consumption can be attained through optimizing the heat exchange network. This can be achieved by cutting the water footprint through lower energy consumption. Secondly, Coates Chemicals aims to lower the emission of carbon IV oxide from its processing sites by 20%. Recycling it can diminish the emission. Thirdly, the company aims to achieve zero waste in landfills.

Recycling waste will help prevent the buildup of waste materials in open lands. Furthermore, recycling will assist the company in reducing some production and manufacturing expenses because some of the materials needed for ethanol production will be readily available. Fourthly, the company aims to foster a positive environment among its employees and subcontractors. Lastly, Coates Chemicals is an ethical company anticipating higher standards from its supply chain. This notion is achieved as the company has opted for eco-friendly production of its goods. Consequently, the company endeavors to minimize its emissions, which could otherwise result in environmental pollution.

The company opted to manufacture vast quantities of bioethanol from voluminous glucose solutions provided by other companies in its production process. The pre-made glucose solution will then be transported to Coates Chemicals via pipeline from a nearby sugar refinery. The following are some of the components of the production plant. Initially, the company procured tanks to store voluminous glucose solutions that will fuel the ethanol production for five days. The plant will feature four continuous fermentation reactors that will operate concurrently. Ultimately, the plant will have a distillation tower that will aid in producing a distillate of ethanol through various processes like purification.

In conclusion, Coates Chemicals successfully produced ethanol with all the expertise and resources readily available. The feasibility study conducted by the company's specialists paved the way for a smoother commencement of the process. Coates Chemicals' goals were deemed quantifiable and attainable with increased effort put into the new endeavor.
