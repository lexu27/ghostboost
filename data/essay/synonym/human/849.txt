Maternal well-being pertains to women’s welfare during gestation, throughout labor, and postnatal. Black women in most regions experience unacceptable substandard maternal health outcomes, including disproportionately elevated mortality rates (Davis, 2020, p. 56). Health and societal system elements significantly influence black women’s elevated maternal fatality rates and substandard health consequences. Consequently, these women of color encounter obstacles to obtaining competent healthcare services and encounter racial bias. Davis (2020, p. 58) contends that factors like sexism and racism unfavorably impact black women’s healthcare outcomes and medical care utilization. For instance, these women of color are prone to being uninsured, facing significant financial challenges with healthcare, and are unlikely to access prenatal care in comparison to white women. Simultaneously, black women contend with elevated chronic health conditions and preventable ailments such as cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, and diabetes. Consequently, these health issues unfavorably affect infant and maternal healthcare outcomes when these women elect to conceive (Davis, 2020, p. 59). Nevertheless, women of color merit healthy and secure pregnancies and childbirth. Hence, what factors influence black maternal health, and what structural modifications should be enacted to ensure its enhancement globally?
There exists a substantial correlation between black maternal health and women in societal issues. For example, some communities discriminate against women based on gender, color, physical capability, class, and ethnicity. Davis (2020, p. 59) elucidates that other individuals believe that men should exert greater power than women; thus, they disregard concepts such as women’s leadership. Certain individuals believe that women’s primary duty is tending to the household and giving birth. These perceptions detrimentally impact women, leading to mental health disorders (Davis, 2020, p. 60). Hence, it is imperative to alter people’s outlooks and attitudes regarding women in society. This can be accomplished by promoting positive perceptions of women within the community and accommodating them in society.
The black maternal subject has garnered global attention. Therefore, it is crucial to ascertain why the quantity of women of color in maternal and childbirth fatalities is increasing worldwide. It is also vital to unearth the reasons behind more maternal complications in black women compared to white individuals. This discussion will aid individuals in recognizing why healthcare organizations catering to women of color deliver lower-quality maternity care. Individuals should comprehend the hurdles that black women encounter in accessing reproductive care that meets their requirements. This care is crucial as it assists women in family planning and bolsters women’s and children’s healthcare outcomes.
Intersectionality entails acknowledging and comprehending that each individual encounters oppression and discrimination uniquely. Intersectionality can be applied in black maternal health subjects to ascertain and pinpoint its causes, such as race, physical capability, and sexual orientation. These factors have negatively impacted women of color globally, resulting in income disparity. For instance, for every dollar paid to a non-Hispanic white man, a black woman receives sixty-three cents. In line with Crear-Perry et al. (2021, p. 230), the foregone wages compel women of color to choose between essentials like healthcare, food, and housing due to having less financial means to support their livelihood. Moreover, most individuals believe that black women possess strength and can endure strenuous activities more than white women. Understanding the diverse factors contributing to black maternal health will enable individuals to devise strategies that address each issue for women of color.
Healthcare practitioners, policymakers, and the community play a pivotal role in enhancing black women’s maternal health. Expansion and preservation of healthcare coverage across women of color’s lifespan, encompassing preventive healthcare access, for instance, contraception, is critical. Merely 87% of reproductive-age black females have health insurance (Crear-Perry et al., 2021, p. 233). Furthermore, women of color should receive top-notch, secure, culturally sensitive, and respectful healthcare. Healthcare and public policies should prioritize dispensing patient-centered care to meet black women’s personalized requirements. Social determinants, inclusive of workplace, leisure, and residence, should be tackled (Davis, 2020, p. 64). This can be accomplished through policies that foster wealth creation, income elevation, and educational enhancement. Additionally, nations should boost the availability of affordable food and healthcare and ameliorate access to secure, hygienic, and economical housing.
Black women should be granted paid leave to attend to themselves and their offspring. Women of color necessitate access to community healthcare providers as they furnish maternal, reproductive, and primary healthcare services to them (Davis, 2020, p. 64). The absence of these professionals implies that these women would be deprived of crucial healthcare services. There should be more robust protective measures for expectant women of color. This will ensure that employers provide reasonable adjustments for pregnant women.
In conclusion, black women merit healthy and secure pregnancies and childbirth. Systematic adaptations commencing with the healthcare system, augment healthcare access, and provide healthier work and living environments for women of color. Enhancing black maternal healthcare outcomes will empower women of color to attain optimal well-being and health across their lifespan. Consequently, these individuals can make varied choices, such as when and how to embark on parenthood.
