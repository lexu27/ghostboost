Diana Kendall asserts that the current perception of the category has been a creation of the media and based on the formation, the significance of class is established. Kendall contends that the media has justified inequality in the United States through the presumption, with television programs and newspaper articles shaping and reinforcing class-based stereotypes. Additionally, Kendall argues that class discussions in the media are seldom explicit; nonetheless, their portrayals yield viewpoints that influence human behavior. The affluent class in society is depicted positively, while the lower class is depicted negatively.
On one side, the affluent class comprises individuals that should be admired, consisting of compassionate and charitable individuals, and those with criminal records have notably good lives (Kendall 10). Conversely, the lower class is portrayed as homeless, impoverished, largely overlooked by the media, and frequently discussed as abstract figures. Consequently, when presenting a human aspect, the demographics of the impoverished dictate how they are depicted.
The standard of living may decline from the realization that as the media concentrates on the affluent class’s perspectives and amplifies their concerns, it disregards the worries of lower-class members. The communicated class dialogues by the media, encompassing depictions of the homeless and the impoverished, depict a lifestyle afflicted by idleness, illnesses, criminality, and substance misuse (Kendall 94). The dehumanized figures linked with personalized suffering show individuals detached from the broader contributing elements like joblessness, unawareness, idleness, or otherwise accountable individuals for their miseries (Kendall 94). Hence, due to the disconnection, the life quality of the low-class individuals keeps declining as the uneducated and the impoverished’s necessities are disregarded. While upper-class individuals receive attention, the requirements of the impoverished are not expressed; hence, their lives persist in being exposed to risks of deterioration.
