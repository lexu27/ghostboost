In Chapter 3, there is a conversation on the early development of parole in the US, as well as its use in the current sentencing practices. Among the most vital points of the chapter is that recent research indicates that prisoners who tend to exit prisons without parole oversight show higher failure signs compared to those released with parole requirements. Then, it is recommended that reinstated discretionary parole release is to be granted for a prisoner, given solid pieces of proof. Then, the writers presume that parole release decisions are to be taken by a skilled and proficient board. The latter should have specific guidelines and officially established principles that would make its operation smooth and transparent. Overall, the substance of this chapter is conveyed clearly and precisely; however, there might be more explanation on the crucial points, such as the operational process of the professional parole board.
Chapter 4 illustrates parole oversight – with a focus on how it differs from parole release – in the context of the associated modern practices. According to the content of this chapter, once parolees reach the parole facility to register, there are significantly different conditions compared to those prior to the 1980s. Here, the writers depict effective rehabilitation schemes that can reduce repeat offenses within the given scope, as well as to be suitable in financial terms. They argue that the mentioned schemes should be the primary focus of current research and policymakers’ initiatives. Nevertheless, even though these schemes are described conveniently, there could have been more reflection that would validate them even further, which would be a solid basis for the subsequent chapters.
