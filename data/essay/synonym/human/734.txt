Mary Midgley’s philosophical inheritance is highly varied and crucial in the body of English-language philosophy of the latter part of the twentieth century. This era was characterized by a profound resurgence of interest in relativism and ethics, along with a simultaneous disenchantment with modern independent reason and moral principles. Trying Out One’s New Sword is a narrative about disproving the concept of moral isolationism and obstacles that separate the world into autonomous units with their values and customs.
The core concept of the essay centers on a ceremony in feudal Japan, the aim of which is to assess the efficiency of an untested sword or another weapon. To achieve this goal, the samurai strike a random passerby encountered at a crossroads. Unconventional customs are present not only in Japan but also in other nations because societies hold distinct notions about appropriate conduct. The writer highlights that one’s own culture influences one’s interactions with others: it dictates what individuals condemn in other societies (Midgley, 1981). At times, they are callous towards other communities, and occasionally they censure their own culture by comparing it to others.
Decisions are always grounded on one’s principles, yet at times individuals are unwilling to acknowledge moral relativism. Understanding the intricacy of religion by reducing it to a single local paradigm and then asserting it as universal is unfeasible. Midgley (1981) stresses that it is not forbidden to assess other traditions. Nonetheless, one must not erect barriers and should comprehend one’s own culture before evaluating another. Moreover, one of the key highlights of the essay is that there are no distinct isolated societies; they are all continually merging, especially in the contemporary world.
Hence, Mary Midgley rebuts the notion of moral isolationism and presents her perspective on the capacity to appraise other civilizations. The ability to shape one’s own convictions and form judgments about other cultures is crucial; however, one must always remember to be courteous and shun crude viewpoints. All cultures are varied, but the world is interconnected, and that is why no barriers can endure.
