In this article, Corey’s moral decision-making model is used to explain two selected cases. The eight-step procedure of the model is condensed into three successive phases: problem depiction and recognition, lawful data and guidance gathering, and determination on the plan of action.
Problem Depiction and Recognition
Advancement examination outcomes have alerted a corporation that there is a considerable likelihood that their worker misuses substances and is a compulsive deceiver. Consequently, the corporation chooses not to advance but to dismiss the employee. The despondent worker consults an ethical consultant for support.
Initially, as an ethical consultant, it is vital to accurately recognize the issue or a predicament (Neukrug, Fawcett, 2019). On one side, the corporation acts based on its concerns since a substance-abusing worker may lead to added losses and disrupt its operational process. Conversely, the corporation’s choice to dismiss the client may be viewed as unethical. It breaches his civil liberties for confidentiality and may contradict the ethical code for assessing employees (American Counseling Association [ACA], 2014).
Several matters are entangled in the case. Initially, there is the entitlement of a business to operate in line with its financial concerns. Second, there is an individual’s entitlement to mental and overall confidentiality. Furthermore, depending on the specifics, the corporation may have breached the ethics code for employee evaluation by creating an unjust test and abusing it.
Lawful Data and Guidance Gathering
The subsequent phase is to guarantee that all the required ethics codes, regulations, and laws are evaluated and acknowledged (Neukrug, Fawcett, 2019). For this instance, the ethical criteria for confidentiality and privacy are particularly applicable since my responsibility as an ethical consultant is to aid the client while honoring his civil liberties (ACA, 2014). Moreover, if the test's implications are correct, the client's life issues may be linked to substance misuse, making the standards of Avoiding Harm and Imparting Value beneficial as well (ACA, 2014). In terms of pertinent laws for contemplation, there are the Ethical standards that enforce accountability on any social worker to take required actions when someone is at risk (Cottone, Tarvydas, Hartley, 2021).
Addressing the ethical dilemma proceeds with acquiring essential consultations with the law and human rights experts (Neukrug, Fawcett, 2019). The objective is to ascertain if the company has breached human rights and assess the potential for the client to defend his rights with the establishment. Moreover, it appears logical to consult mental health and substance misuse specialists if the substance use contributes to the client's depressive condition.
Determination on the Plan of Action
One of the strategies is to assist the client in suing the corporation and requesting reimbursement. Alternatively, if the client confirms his substance misuse behavior, I might propose a recovery program or recommend a specific clinical therapist for him. The last alternative is confined to providing psychological support and life coaching if no aforementioned options appear optimal.
The choice of further steps relies on the additional data unveiled during an inquiry into the issue. Provided the corporation has infringed civil rights and acted unethically, the optimal choice is to ensure that the client obtains moral restitution or is reinstated in his role in the corporation. Alternatively, my function in aiding the client is restricted to enhancing his mental state and reducing his unhealthy habits if the individual consents to do so.
Problem Depiction and Recognition
The subsequent case portrays a graduate mental health professional lacking competence in career development who is administering interest surveys while counseling individuals for career concerns. As an ethical counselor, I function as her colleague, who has observed such conduct.
The case introduces an ethical dilemma of delivering services without the required qualification and knowledge. Such actions defy the ethical standard of Boundaries of Competence (ACA, 2014). Additionally, the scenario involves the matter of potentially harming the clients of the unethical colleague and, therefore, imposes professional responsibility on me to prevent the inappropriate conduct (Cottone, Tarvydas, Hartley, 2021).
Lawful Data and Guidance Gathering
Numerous ethical and legal standards and laws are pertinent to the issue. Initially, the mentioned Boundaries of Competence expressly prohibit offering unqualified services as they may jeopardize the client's well-being (ACA, 2014). The same applies to the conduct of evaluation and testing governed by Limits of Competence ethical standard (ACA, 2014). Secondly, the Informal Resolution code and Reporting Ethical Violations imply an ethical counselor should endeavor to prevent such actions either informally or by alerting suitable authorities (ACA, 2014). Laws concerning consumer rights may be applicable as well since the service's quality is jeopardized by the absence of proper qualification.
External consultation does not appear necessary for such an instance.
Determination on the Plan of Action
As an ethical counselor, I am anticipated to resolve the issue by initially reaching out to the colleague and informing her about the unethical behavior. The subsequent course of action involves engaging appropriate organizations, like professional ethics communities, to inform them about my concerns.
The decision on selecting formal or informal mitigation of the issue hinges on the colleague's response. Initially executing the informal option allows for resolving the matter without significant consequences for the colleague's career and reputation. This amicable resolution is why I plan to opt for the informal choice first. The formal one may endanger the professional future of my colleague, but if she disregards my worries about her unethical practices, I am obligated to implement this course of action.
