However, in numerous verses of the poet, one can detect Koranic figures and contemplations about the bond between a human and the Creator. Ghalib, in this verse, stresses the significance of God to his spirit and places particular emphasis on the initial existence of God. According to Ghalib, all individuals are the consequence of creation that would have been inconsequential if they were present or absent without God. This is notably apparent in the subsequent lines:
When there was nothing, there was God
If nothing had been, God would have been
My very existence has been my downfall
If I hadn’t existed, what would it have signified?
The poem conveys various moods: pessimistic and optimistic, and it could hinge on the reader and their current situation. Ghalib affirms that God has perpetually been present for a human, and even in the absence of hope and when it appears that the world has concluded, God will aid each soul. The narrator's tone hinges on the observer's perceptions, encounters, and current condition. The writer of this document tends to believe the mood of the poem is optimistic, evoking eternal and unyielding things a person can turn to. Even if the process of human creation had not occurred, a human would still have been connected with God.
Robert Bly conveyed akin ideas using different terms. He articulated: “Our perception of ‘things’ as real doesn’t quite fit with the idea that they don’t actually exist. One Muslim belief envisions the universe we know as a blend of the Existent and the Non-Existent. Entities such as trees, roads, individuals, and clouds all pertain to Non-Existence: they are merely silhouettes cast by a truly existent sun.” The truly existent sun in this context is God, and all people, nature, and other unavoidable facets of human existence are silhouettes. Being near the sun is akin to being close to God and oneself. Subsequently, all other features will hold significance in each individual's lifetime.
