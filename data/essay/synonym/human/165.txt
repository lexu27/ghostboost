It is evident to contemporary individuals, as well as many individuals who resided in the 1930s, that the Second Global Conflict was unavoidable. Some argue that the United States of America could avert the eruption of the conflict. Nevertheless, this could scarcely be achievable due to various factors. The American administration upheld an isolationist foreign strategy in the 1930s. The era was demanding as all nations had to tackle severe economic problems (Corbett et al., 2021). Americans desired to focus on internal affairs, encompassing a menacing spread of socialist notions (Russett, 2019). It is remarkable that the USA could barely intervene and have a substantial impact on European matters due to the nationâ€™s relatively modest economic power. The United States was not a monetary frontrunner at that time, so its sway was restricted. Additionally, the USA alone could not avert the global conflict because it erupted as a consequence of the confrontation between European nations. The repercussions of the Treaty of Versailles set the stage for the recent conflict, as nearly all stakeholders were discontent. Germany amassed resources and forged alliances with other autocracies, so any nation could not play a definitive role in this confrontation. No country could impede the commencement of the recent conflict as the administrations that arose in Europe (the socialist USSR, Nazi Germany, and fascist Italy) were prone to instigate a new military confrontation that would inevitably escalate into a global conflict. Consequently, it is plausible to presume that the USA could not have hindered the onset of the Second Global Conflict even if the American administration had renounced its isolationist foreign policy. In this regard, the country made a monumental contribution to halting the conflict and instituting a new global system.
