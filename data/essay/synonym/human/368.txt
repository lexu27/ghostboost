Preface
The essence and configuration of warfare alter, but its fundamental nature remains consistent. Nearly two decades of uninterrupted irregular warfare against violent extremist groups globally — the requirement for expertise in irregular hostilities endures. The commanders seek the optimal strategy for addressing irregular warfare and readying troops for operational activities. The route to changes can involve the introduction of the Performance Triad and enhancement of the leaders' personal traits, considering the nuances of irregular warfare.
How Leaders can Execute the Performance Triad to Assist Ready their Organizations for Irregular Warfare
Irregular warfare differs from traditional ones and thus necessitates specialized training. Irregular warfare, which differs in structure, delineates categories of violence carried out by sub-state actors, encompassing terrorism and insurgency (James D. Kiras, 2009, p. 3). Irregular forces on one or both sides essentially quelled the ongoing conflicts following the invasion of Iraq, the resurgence of Taliban insurgency in the 2001 Afghan war, clashes in Darfur, the rebellion of the Lord’s Resistance Army in northern Uganda, and the Second Chechen Conflict.
Conducting effective operations in irregular warfare demands even more diligent utilization of soldiers' physical resources; here, the Performance Triad can be beneficial. It is a comprehensive strategy to build readiness and resilience through public health initiatives and leadership involvement. Army Medicine has the honor of preserving, restoring, and enhancing the health of the entire Army community and assisted the Army in establishing the Performance Triad (Sleep, Activity, and Nutrition) initiative. Sleep is crucial for the proper cognitive and physical functioning of the body. For soldiers, a lack of sleep can impede the execution of commands both during and outside training, jeopardizing soldiers and units. Staying in shape is essential for preparing a soldier for action. Maintaining an active lifestyle and adhering to secure and efficient training principles enables soldiers to fulfill their duties and become more effective combatants. A nutritious diet supports exercise, boosts energy and endurance, reduces recovery periods between activities, enhances focus and concentration, and promotes soldiers' well-being.
The aim of the Performance Triad is to positively impact and sustain the health, readiness, and resilience of soldiers and the entire army community. The trial initiative, initiated in 2013 and concluded in 2014, reinforced the significance of committed leadership as a basis for supporting soldiers and promoting healthy sleep, activity, and dietary habits to bolster readiness and resilience. The widespread adoption of this approach will bolster the physical and moral conditioning of soldiers, which is particularly crucial in irregular warfare.
How the Implementation of Mission Command during Irregular Warfare Will Encounter Distinct Challenges than in Conventional Conflicts
The increasingly intricate security environment suggests the necessity for a revised comprehension of irregular warfare. The challenge of irregular cooperative solutions lies in this combined regimen: reactive adversaries such as terrorists, insurgents, and criminal networks, advancements in technology, and other phenomena on a considerable scale, such as these irregular assaults, even more lethal, capable of inducing widespread disorder. These incursions enmesh populations through adept utilization of communications, cyberspace, and technology to extend their impact to regional and global levels. Many of them essentially manifest as a contest for influence and legitimacy.
The emphasis is on addressing the underlying economic, political, cultural, or security circumstances that fuel the grievances of the populace, rather than directly employing military might against the military and paramilitary forces of adversaries (Department of Defense, 2010, p. 20). The Cold War experience illustrates that enduring traditional warfare – troop movements, partner interactions, public relations, partner logistics, security aid, intelligence, and counterintelligence operations, and training – complement and mutually bolster objectives. However, due to the nature of intricate and shapeless attacks, these contests are improbable to culminate in an abrupt military triumph. Mitigating, diminishing, managing the conflict and its roots can be deemed as success. Therefore, joint power must seek multidimensional approaches in collaboration with other partners to resolve the issues. The intricate political, cultural, religious, and historical aspects and the diverse populations implicated in all conflicts are challenging to comprehend thoroughly. Understanding the intricate features and causes of irregular warfare can aid in molding the proper strategist, both for soldiers and leaders.
How Leaders Might Need to Adapt their Leadership Attribute of Intellect during Irregular Warfare
The army leadership criteria delineate the qualities and proficiencies anticipated of every Army leader – character, presence, and intellect. These attributes frequently mirror personal experience and long-term development and are not promptly acquired from direct training events. At the organizational level, they are directly linked to how a leader behaves, influences organizational change, and steers the unit through challenges and setbacks. Since irregular warfare typically results in prolonged and erratic conflicts, the government should tweak the leader attributes to ensure maximal organizational backing and mission completion. In irregular warfare, success demands a mindset that concentrates on how to sway the populace to support the HN leadership positively (United States Air Force, 2013, p.21). Intellect encompasses an individual's capacity and knowledge. Intelligence empowers leaders to be imaginative and engaging to comprehend occurrences, discernments, duties, and actions. Intelligence equips leaders to reason analytically, critically, ethically, and culturally sensitively. Intellect engages in weighing the deliberate and inadvertent repercussions of decisions made by the leader. Competent leaders must forecast the second and third-order implications of their decisions.
A leader's cognitive capability influences how effectively they think and lead others. Every leader must be self-aware of their strengths and limitations and apply them appropriately. Leader development is the intentional, continuous, and progressive process – rooted in the Army Ethic – that converts Soldiers and Army Civilians into adept, dedicated professional leaders of integrity (Department of Army, 2017, p. 7). Innovative problem resolutions tend to be inquisitive, striving to fathom why something is occurring the way it is or posing queries if something might function better. Innovative leaders avert complacency by devising novel methods to challenge subordinates with alternative approaches and ideas (Department of Army, 2019, p.56). To be innovative necessitates creative thinking, utilizing both adaptive (based on experience and prior knowledge) and innovative approaches (fostering completely new concepts). Innovative leaders forestall complacency by devising fresh strategies to challenge their subordinates.
To be pioneers, leaders rely on their intuition, experience, knowledge, and input from their subordinates. Innovative leaders enhance team building by holding everyone accountable – and stakeholders in innovation. Traditional forces have supported or spearheaded counterinsurgency campaigns in Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan; stabilization missions in Bosnia and Somalia; and other irregular campaigns. The conventional military forces must not forfeit the capability to wage irregular warfare. Thus, competent leadership forms the groundwork for constructing tactics for conducting military operations, notably during irregular warfare.
Conclusion
Recent encounters reveal that there are more effective and less expensive ways to achieve strategic triumph in irregular warfare. Since 2014, conventional and special operations forces have collaborated closely in Iraq and Syria to enhance the time-honored “through, with and through” strategy for irregular warfare. These operations have demonstrated to be more cost-effective than unilateral actions. The government possesses a model, but institutionalizing these insights demands a robust, departmental approach. It is vital to introduce innovative methodologies, considering the nuances of irregular warfare. Among the advancements presently observable, the government should widely disseminate the Performance Triad, which
