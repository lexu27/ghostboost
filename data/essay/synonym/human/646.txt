Preamble
The exploration of philosophy enhances an individual's capacity to solve problems and broadens one's imagination to facets of life beyond physical science. Philosophical abilities enable academics to scrutinize concepts, definitions, debates, and topics that directly impact the understanding of life (Blanshard 12). These abilities contribute to the skill to structure thoughts and issues, deal with matters of value, and extract essential information from extensive amounts of data. By necessitating intellectual involvement, philosophy significantly contributes to the academic pursuit. This paper argues that philosophy is vital as it broadens a student's perspective in higher education to worldviews on thought frequency, vibration, and energy. In higher education, philosophy involves getting familiar with notable figures and advancements in antiquity, mastering current methodologies, and embracing philosophical problems. Exposure to philosophical concepts helps scholars cultivate crucial, analytical, and observational skills that can be deemed most valuable in the broader context of life.
Essential Characteristics of a Philosopher
Philosophy plays a crucial role in fulfilling four criteria that should form the basis of any institution of higher learning. The foundational competencies encompass instilling fundamental thought patterns in students and refining their textual interpretation, writing, and effective communication skills. These skills are crucial in shaping cultural identities and motivating scholars to explore critical inquiries about reality, knowledge, and significance (Rick 583). Specific essential traits define a scholar as a competent philosopher prepared to partake in constructive dialogues that influence decisions in everyday life. The most prevalent attributes include receptiveness, doubt, and a systematic approach to thinking.
Receptiveness
Receptiveness is a key trait that characterizes a scholar as a philosopher. Receptiveness is better perceived as a predisposition rather than an eventuality. Receptiveness pertains not to one's fixed opinions but to one's readiness to amend them under appropriate circumstances. It demands genuine humility in acknowledging admitted fallibility and adjusting perspectives on existing issues (Blanshard 32). Receptiveness is a constructive quality within a philosophical framework. It serves as a counterbalance to confirmation bias, an epistemic flaw. In this context, receptiveness represents the epistemically commendable tendency to resist the adverse effects of confirmation bias on our ability to reason soundly and evaluate evidence and arguments.
Doubt
A proficient philosopher must also possess certain degrees of doubt that prompt further investigation into the information presented in a discourse. Doubt entails challenging knowledge assertions made across various domains of Western philosophy (Rick 571). Skeptics have contested the adequacy or reliability of these assertions by probing the foundations on which they rest or what they genuinely establish. A critical mindset will assist the scholar in demanding justification for the moral claims of others. Moreover, the scholar will reject appeals to authority in favor of considering all viewpoints.
Systematic Thinking
A model philosopher should also exhibit indications of systemic thinking in their approach to life issues. Aligned with systems philosophy, systemic thinking concerns grasping a system by analyzing the relationships and interactions among the system's constituent elements. Systemic thinking proves particularly advantageous when grappling with complex or wicked problems (Blanshard 12). In philosophy, systemic thinking better anticipates future outcomes based on a deeper understanding of the underlying structure and its components than on past occurrences. Several philosophers have demonstrated some of these qualities, including Socrates, an Athenian Greek philosopher credited with pioneering Western philosophy.
Logical Argument for Socrates
Socrates emerges as an exemplary scholar who views philosophy as applying logic and rationality to pursue knowledge. According to Socrates, such knowledge can be attained through engagement with the environment (Blanshard 22). Socrates established that philosophy concerns the subject of inquiry, even though such a pursuit seldom comprehends the subject. Plato's dialogues featuring Socrates illustrate that philosophy involves introspection, exploration of various aspects of life, and acknowledgment of recognized limitations.
