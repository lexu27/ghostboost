Out of the various kinds of opposition utilized by slaves, the one that demanded the finest retaliation is armed and structured uprising. The primary reason is the reality that despite their shortcomings in colonial America, the Haitian Revolution was a sign about slavery always being contested. One of the most usual types of opposition was sabotage of production by damaging tools, pretending illnesses, and delaying the work process. Nonetheless, these were largely ineffective actions because they resulted in discussions where masters gained the most. In addition to sabotage, theft was also a type of opposition, where slaves pilfered specific goods for their personal use. It was carried out primarily due to poor living situations, such as nutrition, among slaves, which is why food was the primary target of theft. It should also be noted that theft was justified from the slaves’ standpoint since they are their masters’ possession, and thus, how can a possession steal the same owner’s property?
Unlike the previously everyday types of opposition, the escape was an overt opposition. However, it was not efficient because it led to stricter supervision and severe penalties. Fleeing was a risky venture with rather low probabilities of success and no widespread impact. Additionally, it was primarily men who had reasonable probabilities of successful escape. Consequently, the most efficient type of opposition with the finest retaliation was armed rebellion, such as the Haitian Revolution. Although it was the sole successful rebellion among numerous suppressed ones, the triumph was not the main focus. The essential message was the reality that slavery will never be accepted and it constantly is contested by slaves, and the Haitian Revolution’s success was a reminder to masters that they will not be able to possess slaves indefinitely.
