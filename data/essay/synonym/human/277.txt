The notion of “gender roles” is frequently employed in the interpretation and understanding of writings from different historical eras. These duties seem to have been clearly defined during the Anglo-Saxon era. The verse Beowulf falls into the epic or heroic poetry category, which features poems that celebrate the characters’ courageous and military deeds. Females are depicted as possessions for the benefit of the males throughout Beowulf and are compelled to assist the male characters. Furthermore, females are used as narrative tools to progress the storyline of males. Women, conversely, are a supporting character in the narrative, their existence being eclipsed by the males.
The queen of the Swedes was unnamed, her identity being secondary to her role as the king’s spouse, Onela. The males, like Hrothgar, Beowulf, Wiglaf, and Unferth, dominated most of the plot of the verse. Consequently, references to females are scarce in contrast. “…the Helming woman went on her rounds…treating the family and the gathered troop,” the verse describes a woman who fulfills conventional gender duties as a figure Beowulf (Heaney 620). The excerpt exemplifies the outlook on women in the eleventh century, that they ought to care for males and be kind. Queen Modthryth was later introduced in the story as the opposite of Queen Hygd, who was self-reliant and disapproved of by males. “Even a queen of great beauty must not overstep like that,” they remarked disdainfully. (Beowulf 1940-1941), until she wed Offa, who compensated her for her self-discipline. Queen Modthryth was deemed socially acceptable only after marriage, suggesting that females had lesser worth unless they were married.
