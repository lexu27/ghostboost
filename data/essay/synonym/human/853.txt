Bobsville’s civic areas remain insecure from a civilian perspective, despite heightened law enforcement efforts by local police officers. Thefts, civil unrest, destruction, and traffic collisions persist as the primary dangers to civic security in Bobsville. The frequency of such occurrences is multiple times a year, which is relatively high for a tranquil city of no more than 9,500 inhabitants. The issue is particularly severe during local celebrations and sports events, during which spontaneous civic disorder arises, and Bobsville’s immediate population is temporarily boosted by tourist arrivals (Taylor et al., 2018). Consequently, there is a necessity to establish a contingency strategy in the event that employees experience acts of theft or sudden popular revolt, as well as when involved in a traffic crash.
Once threats to civic safety emerge, one of the roles of communication platforms is the dissemination and gathering of quality information, enabling users to be self-aware of the extent of perils and to take specific precautionary measures. A crucial message outlining the threat to the user can then be spread through the website. This could be a pop-up container that promptly emerges when the user accesses the website. This container comprises the date and time of the occurrence, what transpired, and 1-2 recommendations on what individuals are advised to do to ensure personal safety. Preventative messages should be circulated through social media platforms before the most probable incident. For instance, if a large number of thefts or a sudden fan revolt and large fight are anticipated at a sports festival, a social media post would alert users to be vigilant, safeguard their possessions, and avoid crowded areas. Moreover, in the event of an incident having already transpired, vital messages via social media aid in adhering to safety procedures and guiding users. Lastly, crucial crisis information can also be broadcasted through traditional media outlets. Nevertheless, it must be acknowledged that radio, television, or newspapers are not as portable as smartphones, so it is more probable that the user will not resort to traditional media as a routine. For those employees who do utilize these channels, essential messages should comprise guidelines for preventive actions to avert incidents — a catalog of prohibited behaviors — and swift instructions if an incident arises. For instance, if a group of irate sports enthusiasts exited the stadium and proceeded to vandalize shops and use violence, key messages via traditional media include advice to steer clear of specific spots in the city. Thus, various wordings are utilized for diverse platforms:
Website "Alert. There is a popular revolt unfolding in Bobsville on January 30. For personal safety, evade downtown square and the stadium"; "A severe traffic accident occurred on the south side of the town. Verify the casualty list."
Social Media "To fully enjoy the event, acquaint yourself with some personal safety guidelines..."; "A large fight is ongoing at the festival right now — if you are present, follow the evacuation exit promptly."
Traditional Media "A sports festival is ongoing today in Bobsville. Remain vigilant and safeguard your belongings to deter theft"; "In case of public unrest or accidents, note down emergency contact numbers for assistance."
Nonetheless, in striving to guarantee civic security, it is not always feasible to comprehensively address all potential issues. Deficiencies in law enforcement create opportunities for potential difficult inquiries. Among such queries are several formulations in this context. Firstly, if public uprisings arise, where were the police to prevent them? Secondly, if the fans possess batons and counterfeit flares, why were these prohibited items not confiscated at the entry checkpoint? Thirdly, what should individuals trapped during an occurrence — large fight or vehicle accident — and unable to reach the evacuation exits do? Fourthly, what ensures that assembling individuals at evacuation sites will not evolve into a center of fresh public dissatisfaction?
The history and settings of the city of Bobsville have been researched adequately to recognize the presence of early indications of forthcoming issues. It is a moderately small town, signifying a significant number of close relationships among local inhabitants, including unresolved disputes, are anticipated. Furthermore, the transient population increase due to visiting tourists may be linked to a feeling of joyful intoxication: "if I do not return here, they can enjoy themselves here." The situation is worsened by the existence of a local historic winery that exclusively sells alcohol in large quantities; the sobriety of inebriated enthusiasts or drivers proves to be a challenge for public safety.
