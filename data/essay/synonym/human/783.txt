Preface
The ethos of Eastern European nations differs from the American one. The current dissertation explores a unique Russian cultural occasion known as Maslenitsa that signifies the "reawakening of Nature from hibernation" (Maltseva, 2020, p. 26). Initially, it is a heathen festival denoting the "magical transformation of the Sun – the offspring of the pagan Slavic deity Kolyada, into a handsome, blooming young man – Yarilo-Sun" (Maltseva, 2020, p. 26). Put differently, during this celebration, individuals bid farewell to winter and welcome spring. Every year the festivity commences at varying dates because this relies on the dates of observance of the Passover which, in turn, hinges on the Vernal Equinox. Maslenitsa could be defined as a butter week. In addition to Russian Maslenitsa, the dissertation delves into the French Mardi Gras and Polish Tlusty Czwartek.
Contemplation on the Occasion
I have acquired knowledge about this cultural event from my Russian comrade, who always prepares pancakes to honor it. Subsequently, I viewed a video from this event on YouTube and discovered it extremely vibrant and enjoyable. In the recording, one could witness how individuals sing, dance, wield the accordion, cook and consume pancakes, engage in team sports such as tug of war and king of the hill, and erect a fortress from snow (CCTV Video News Agency, 2018). While observing the video, what caught my attention is that grown-ups are as eager to partake in it as youngsters. It is intriguing to observe that this festival epitomizes a profound sense of togetherness because in games, typically there are two teams, and during dancing, unfamiliar individuals clasp hands.
Initially, the festival appears quite mundane and resembles a fair where individuals devour food and purchase goods. Nevertheless, subsequently, this initial impression dissipates when individuals commence playing and dancing. Simultaneously, what I have witnessed does not evoke a wish to join. Furthermore, the ritual of incinerating an effigy of Maslenitsa that assumes the form of a woman is somewhat harsh.
Exploration of the Occasion
As it has previously been noted, Maslenitsa is a heathen festival. Concurrently, Russia is an orthodox Christian nation, and faith is an inseparable constituent of its self-image (Curanovic, 2019). The period of observing a heathen Maslenitsa is succeeded by the orthodox Great Lent lasting 40 days. Consequently, the festivity of Maslenitsa exhibits a distinct amalgamation and co-existence of perspectives within one nation. Before the Christianization in 988, ancient Russia was heathen, and the custom of celebrating Maslenitsa has persisted over centuries.
Another intriguing fact pertains to the duration of this festival. Specifically, Maslenitsa endures for one week, throughout which individuals consume pancakes daily to prepare for the ensuing Great Lent (Maltseva, 2020). It seems intricate for individuals from other cultures to consume pancakes with butter, sugar, caviar, and preserves throughout the entire week. The occasion delineated above is conducted on the ultimate day of Maslenitsa. The majority of contemporary individuals solely celebrate the final day and evade the traditional aspect of the festival that proposes consuming pancakes the entire week. Russian pancakes are distinct from American ones; they bear resemblance to French crepes, and the thinner and more porous Russian pancakes are, the better.
Outside Influence and Historical Ways of Celebration
In recent years, globalization and westernization have significantly influenced cultures globally. As indicated by Ergashev and Farxodjonova (2020), globalization exerts a substantial detrimental impact on national cultures and divests them of their individuality. Undoubtedly, the comprehensive Russian culture has undergone transformations incited by the influence from external sources. Nevertheless, the potency of this influence is not potent enough to modify the age-old traditions of Maslenitsas celebration (Chetverikova, 2018). Throughout this fest, individuals still don national attire, sing archaic songs, and engage in ancient pastimes. Certainly, some organizers of such festivities might incorporate prevalent western music in the backdrop. Nonetheless, in most cases, individuals diligently uphold the customs of their Slavic forebears.
From the aforementioned, one could deduce that the occasion is observed in the same manner as it has been historically in contemporary times. The minor disparity is that with time this festival shed its heathen element. For instance, Slavic tribes linked Maslenitsa with the conclusion of spring and the remembrance of the departed souls (Wijethunga & Abeysinghe, 2018). Presently, there is a distinct day designated for visiting the graves of acquaintances and relatives in Russian culture.
Subsidiary Cultural Events: Similarities
Maslenitsa possesses counterparts across European and Latin American nations. For instance, in France, individuals celebrate Mardi Gras, and in Poland, this festivity is termed Tlusty Czwartek. The former occasion is rendered as a Fat Tuesday and the latter as a Fat Thursday. Both these festivities are grounded in the ancient Slavic pre-Christian custom of bidding farewell to winter. Additionally, all three celebrations, Maslenitsa, Mardi Gras, and Tlusty Czwartek, are succeeded by the Lenten period. In this manner, these festivals are united by the fact that individuals eat, dance, and revel before fasting.
Subsidiary Cultural Events: Disparities
Despite the existing resemblances, there are numerous differences between Mardi Gras, and Tlusty Czwartek, and Maslentisa. The primary distinction is that whereas in Poland and France these festivities endure one day, Maslentisa spans a week-long celebration. Undoubtedly, it holds true that the principal celebration is conducted on the ultimate day of Maslenitsa; in France and Poland, there is no tradition of preparing and consuming fatty food throughout the entire week.
Cuisine
Another notable disparity lies in the cuisine that is crafted during the festival. In the Russian iteration of this festivity, the primary dish is a pancake embellished with diverse toppings as it mirrors the sun. Individuals might bake pies and cookies, but it hinges on their preference and is not an obligatory aspect of the festival. Simultaneously, apart from crepes, traditional Mardi Gras fare encompasses king cakes, cannoli, doughnuts, waffles, crawfish étouffée, and dirty rice. To commemorate Tlusty Czwartek, Polish individuals prepare doughnuts filled with rose or plum jam, a sweet pastry referred to as angel wings. Moreover, in Poland, pancakes are not as prevalent as doughnuts.
Activities
Another contrast between the events lies in the activities that individuals engage in. In France, Mardi Gras is accompanied by masquerade processions and masked balls. Consequently, individuals are attired in unique costumes and masks; they do not don the traditional garments of peasants as Russian individuals do. Hence, Mardi Gras bears a resemblance to a carnival and a parade in flamboyant costumes. Tlusty
