The lawsuit of Bridgestone vs. IBM illustrates a scenario that highlights the significance of communication in collaboration between enterprises. Essentially, the American branch of Bridgestone asked IBM to create an extensive business framework capable of handling a substantial number of orders. Due to various issues, the system produced by IBM was launched late but significantly before the final development stages, causing significant financial losses and reputational damage to both firms. Examining the specifics of the situation offers insight into common hurdles in important ventures and how mishandling extensive projects can impact the reputation of partnering businesses.

Initially, assessing what alterations each party could make to enhance the results reveals that both organizations faced challenges impeding their progress that were not openly discussed. IBM struggled with a project that had been tried multiple times by other suppliers, leading to unanticipated obstacles unaddressed by management. These hurdles led to delays in system rollout, and due to communication misunderstandings, Bridgestone proceeded with the incomplete system launch. The most straightforward remedy for Bridgestone, which could have significantly enhanced the results in this instance, would have been to delay the launch and allow IBM to complete the system. Although a delay might have incurred additional costs, the order data could have been secure without jeopardizing the existing customer base. Furthermore, it appears that IBM insisted on conducting a trial launch of the system. Thus, the negative outcomes could have been averted if Bridgestone had not neglected the supplier's request and had not excessively prioritized rapid enhancements to the current system.

Subsequently, there is a notable contrast in the damage inflicted by the publicity surrounding this project on the two companies. On one side, Bridgestone experienced a considerable loss of clients, business associates, and brand advocates. Additionally, the firm seemingly suffered significant financial harm from the unsuccessful system implementation, despite the system's development not falling within Bridgestone's expertise. Consequently, Bridgestone incurred more losses from the project failure compared to IBM. Nevertheless, IBM's reputation was more adversely affected by the public fallout when Bridgestone initiated legal action against IBM. Apart from being accused of breaching the contract, IBM was alleged to have engaged in fraud due to surpassing Bridgestone's initial budget for system development. Additionally, Bridgestone claimed that IBM assigned unskilled staff lacking the requisite expertise to carry out the project. Therefore, despite Bridgestone's error in the premature system launch, IBM's standing as a supplier failing to deliver its obligations suffered more due to the public backlash.

Lastly, given the magnitude of the dispute between the two entities, it is surprising that they reached a mutual resolution several years later. Just before the jury selection in 2018, both parties opted to withdraw their lawsuits, although it remains uncertain if any financial settlements were involved in the decision. Furthermore, both organizations filed a motion with prejudice, indicating that their resolution is final, and the lawsuit cannot be revisited in the future. Hence, it seems that by acknowledging their errors, the companies approached addressing the adverse aftermath of the failed project with a more conciliatory attitude compared to the period of system development.
