One should observe that Chapter 9 elucidates some concepts and ideas about the future and advancement of society and the state as a whole. Garth Morgan Massey in his book asserts that most contemporary individuals are self-assured in their capacities to manage situations and alter occurrences and phenomena for the better (p.321). Nonetheless, only the power of logic harnessed to the inquiry can transform individuals’ “disadvantage” in the best light (p. 321). Accordingly, the writer refers to this aspect as a type of advancement and enumerates several fundamental concepts concerning this occurrence.
Firstly, he affirms that distinct individuals, groups, and communities may possess different thoughts, notions, and convictions about advancement. Some perceive such enhancements in more universal occurrences, and some do not anticipate drastic changes at all but aspire to live “well.” Furthermore, as corroboration to these statements, Massey appends the thoughts and ideas of some renowned figures. Therefore, in accordance with David Harvey, people strive to amass and augment material goods and prosperity to enhance life (p.321-322). Advocates of postmodernism contemplate on these matters and assert that the present-day world is the self-referential world, and contemporary times are a “tangle of myths.” Particularly in the era of consumerism, individuals tend to accumulate in a stream of numerous occurrences, but they are not as content as they desire.
Lester B. Brown contends that a contemporary world is disorderly; preceding experience dictates subsequent human actions, such as forthcoming alterations in climate, population, volume of water, product prices, and states (p. 322-323). Furthermore, technologies “absorb” an individual’s soul, divesting it of genuine, innate human attributes. Tim Jackson opines that one can attain advantages without economic and financial expansion because many other elements are indispensable for humanity (p. 323). Additionally, some renowned writers perceive dystopia solely at the juncture of reverting to the remnants and heritage of the past and in harmony with nature (p. 323).
Secondly, the author articulates the subsequent concepts concerning the future of humanity. By their disposition and essence, individuals strive to discover as much as possible about themselves and others, about the surroundings and the future (p. 324). Usually, the likelihood of evaluating the future is high if we assess the factual, unbiased factors and prerequisites. For instance, George Orwell could “peer into” the world of the future in the book “1984” or Herman Kahn in the book “The Year 2000” (p. 325). They were accurate because they predicted aspects such as advanced technology, surveillance, instant data transmission, and more. Massey also concurs with the assertions of these imaginative individuals and is convinced that a current human is so inundated with information that only a minuscule fraction of them are advantageous and crucial (p. 325). Even in the archives of the administration of some nations and some sizable firms, such an extensive amount of data is retained that it seems very plausible to formulate a depiction of forthcoming occurrences (p. 325).
Thirdly, the writer affirms that advancement and societal transformation are an innate process and the flow of things, influenced by globalization and inclinations in corporate behavior and thinking (p. 326-329). Additionally, the origin of societal transformation does not carry much weight since the human element is one of the most fundamental and vital (p. 327-328). Furthermore, educators also impact transformations, and their role is pivotal for the evolution of the new generations (p. 331). For instance, numerous other non-governmental organizations assist younger individuals in cultivating skills and capabilities that impact issue resolution, such as Teach for America or AmeriCorps (p. 331). Alterations and shifts are an indispensable process that the Government and the populace should collaborate on, taking into account each party’s voice. Social transformation endeavor implies accountability for decisions, and even the slightest action could result in inevitable repercussions. Nonetheless, ethical and moral principles should also not be disregarded in this context (p. 333-334). No transformations occur without human involvement, and everyone can make a valuable contribution to the future and advancement growth (p. 338).
