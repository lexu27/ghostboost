A hospital-acquired pressure wound (HAPI) is a localized damage of underlying tissue or skin that some patients experience during their stay in a hospital. HAPI is usually a consequence of prolonged immobility of patients, resulting in unrelieved pressure on bony prominences. Along with shear, this pressure is associated with other factors such as age, perfusion, nutritional status, hematological measurements, illness severity, and diabetes (Rondinelli et al., 2018). Despite the recent decrease, the number of patients who acquired pressure wound during their stay is still over a million in the USA (Tschannen & Anderson, 2020). The development of HAPI raises patients' risks of dying during the hospital stay by 2.8 times and dying within 30 days after leaving the medical facility by 1.69 (Tschannen & Anderson, 2020). Additionally, hospital-acquired pressure injury is accompanied by significant pain and suffering, delayed functional recovery, as well as extended time for healing and hospital stay (Tschannen & Anderson, 2020). Even though extensive research has been conducted on the topic, HAPI remains a substantial issue for elderly patients and a costly challenge for hospitals. 
Throughout the patients' time at the hospital, the primary care for them is provided by and the responsibility of the nurse practitioners. Since pressure wounds are proven to be avoidable, the early recognition of the modifiable causes of the development of HAPI and taking corrective measures can halt the progression of the disease (Rondinelli et al., 2018). As such, working directly with patients enables nursing professionals to identify the symptoms and prevent pressure wounds from developing. Failing to evaluate and prevent HAPI in patients accurately can lead to a severe impact on their lives and delay the healing process (Rondinelli et al., 2018). Furthermore, slow healing results in even longer hospital stay, which in turn facilitates the worsening of HAPI and increases healthcare costs. 
Within the framework of the assignment, for constructing a PCIOT question, each of its elements is further identified and described. The patients suffering from hospital-acquired pressure wounds are typically considered to be the older generation. The injury is acquired during their prolonged stay in a hospital, affected by their immobility, nutritional status, and illness severity. One of the evidence-based solutions that can be applied to reducing the rates of acquiring and developing pressure wound in elderly patients is the minimization of shear and friction. It can be achieved by using low-friction slide sheets and air-assisted transfer devices, reducing the risk of skin injuries. Another solution for HAPI prevention is the appropriate usage of pressure redistribution surfaces, such as pressure-reducing mattresses. The outcomes of these measures can be evaluated by calculating and comparing the rates of HAPI development in patients. The time frame involved in the evidence-based practice initiative can be set to a year. 
As a result, the PCIOT question can be constructed as such:
  * P = elderly patients within the risk of developing a hospital-acquired pressure wound
  * I = minimization of shear and friction
  * C = usage of pressure redistribution
  * O = reducing the rates of HAPI development
  * T = a year
  * PICOT Question: In elderly patients with the risk of acquired pressure wound during the hospital stay, how effective is the minimization of shear and friction compared to the usage of pressure redistribution surfaces in reducing the rate of HAPI development a year?
