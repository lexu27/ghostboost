Text: Situations and Encountered Problems
In the case study depicted, the general environment encircling the Asian Health Services (AHS) firm seems to exert added stress on the companyâ€™s leaders. AHS is a thriving organization that managed to handle over 117,000 patient appointments in 2014 and owned seven locations as well as three properties (Chung & Chin, 2015). Nonetheless, with the initiation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the scenario altered significantly, bringing about both benefits and drawbacks for AHS. Despite the increase in patient demand due to ACA, the healthcare institution faced a notable obstacle when integrating the new uninsured patients into the system and commencing their care (Chung & Chin, 2015). Additionally, under the enacted law, the standard of care had to be enhanced significantly, and the payment for performance structure had to be enforced (Chung & Chin, 2015). In the long run, these hurdles were surmounted by establishing an electronic health records system, concentrating on patient assistance, and introducing new amenities.
Nevertheless, various concerns persisted despite the successful transformations. At present, the organization must intensify its endeavors in delivering superior care for its staff. Therefore, the client services division needs more staff proficient in multiple languages for effective communication, while the head medical officer contends that doctors and other caregivers require extra motivations (Chung & Chin, 2015). The medical and dental facilities were also recommended for expansion, considering the rising patient numbers (Chung & Chin, 2015). Consequently, pivotal choices must be taken if AHS is to enhance its current results and tackle the emerging complexities.
