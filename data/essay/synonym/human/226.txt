There is a increasing number of doctorsâ€™ meetings with the survivors of human trafficking, at times even without identifying them as such. Recently, Todres (2017) narrated an event, where Dr. W was asked to examine the female staff of such a company for sexually transmitted infections. On one side, as per the Principles of Medical Ethics of the American Medical Association (2011), it is crucial to protect patient confidentiality, covering various aspects like physical, informational, decisional, and associational privacy. Simultaneously, it is mandatory to keep the files of all the patients in the medical facilities whereas Dr. W was instructed not to retain them to prevent potential arrest of these women. Thus, the physician realized that in another scenario, the staff of this company would not have an opportunity for thorough healthcare and, besides, could potentially disseminate the STIs further.
The situation involves matters in multiple domains, including penal law, moral issues, human rights, and service provider regulations. From the perspective of conspiracy law, it is conceivable to infer that the consent of Dr. W is akin to the involvement in the offense. Since she is cognizant of the offense and did not disclose it but assisted in its execution, the court's ruling might not be in her favor. Concerning human rights, solicitation is unlawful in the US. Furthermore, if the minors are employed in the company, the incident falls under the obligatory reported law (Todres, 2016). Ethical reflections here also suggest aiding a minor by violating confidentiality.
In conclusion, the judgment in the situation of an interaction with human trafficking must be ambiguous. By supporting the operations of a business involved in human trafficking, a physician is to some extent accountable for the crimes and mistreatment of women and children. Hence, in accordance with the legal frameworks and ethical considerations, such incidents should be disclosed.
