The medical issue explored in this task is diabetes mellitus, which is increasingly emerging as the primary cause of disability globally. The condition presents itself through high blood sugar levels, and it is classified into type 1 and type 2. Type 2 diabetes is the most widespread and accounts for nearly 90% of all cases. The origins of this ailment are diverse, including pregnancy, medications, and lifestyles. Its complications impact all bodily organs, resulting in fatal consequences. The demographic under examination in this task predominantly includes elderly individuals with type 2 diabetes in a context with nurse-managed care.

The existence of this issue is supported by various details and data from multiple researchers. Macido (2019) discovered that Diabetes mellitus is among the prominent medical issues in the United States and globally. The investigators utilized data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, where over 12% of elderly individuals in the US are affected by the condition (Macido, 2019). Furthermore, a considerable portion of the populace remains undiagnosed with diabetes mellitus. As per the American Diabetes Association (ADA) (n. d.), the problem ranks as the seventh leading cause of mortality and morbidity, with over one million newly documented cases annually. Hence, diabetes constitutes a persistent ailment that currently burdens healthcare systems and stakeholders.

The study is relevant because there is a necessity to enhance community/patient awareness and adherence to treatment strategies. Additionally, the investigation will educate healthcare providers on better patient approaches outside clinical environments. Nikitara et al. (2019) asserts that many patients experience complications due to inadequate understanding of self-care and compliance with treatment regimens. Simultaneously, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus is likely to escalate hospitalizations and emergency visits in healthcare facilities. Therefore, this study is crucial to shed light on various factors that could lead to reduced hospital stays and enhanced health outcomes post-discharge.

Numerous sources indicate a rising prevalence of diabetes. The number of individuals afflicted by the condition is projected to approach nearly 350 million by 2030 (Macido, 2019). A prominent demographic shift is the increasing count of patients aged over 60 years. Nikitara et al. (2019) uncovered that nurses should monitor additional clinical signs of the disease. These encompass a cold sensation, damp skin, and elevated blood sugar levels. Nurses can employ automatically generated protocols to handle the ailment, but intravenous drug administration might be imperative for treating lethargic patients. In cases of severe hyperglycemia, caregivers should notify the physician, who may opt to transfer the patients to intensive care units and follow the requisite treatment protocols like intravenous insulin delivery or other fluids. The reliability of data hinges on its timeliness, pertinence, credibility, precision, and intent. It would be unreliable if it overlooks the essential research demands, apart from being outdated and containing erroneous or false information.

Numerous obstacles impede the execution of evidence-based practices in managing diabetes mellitus. The restricted time allocated for primary care consultations with healthcare providers obstructs the implementation of evidence-based solutions (Macido, 2019). Additionally, deficient communication between patients and healthcare providers impacts the quality of information gathered to inform treatment plans. Lower levels of patient education also hinder their comprehension of their well-being and treatment guidelines. Poverty poses a hurdle as it exposes patients to a higher risk of complications. Nurses also grapple with adapting to evolving treatment objectives due to limited resources, which compromises care quality. Likewise, some lack confidence in comprehending guidelines and performing specific duties. They may also falter in sharing responsibilities with clients, thereby failing to support behavioral modifications. Nikitara et al. (2019) discovered that responsibilities have shifted among physicians, secondary caregivers, and primary caregivers, introducing ambiguity regarding the appropriate clinical duties. This shift engenders frustration among them as it affects patient adherence to treatment.

Nursing regulations and protocols are efficacious in enhancing patient health outcomes and the general populace. They stress shared and nurse-guided care to attain the desired health results. Nursing standards prioritize independence, aiding patients in managing the ailment on a lifelong basis. They emphasize personalized day-to-day management encompassing skincare, dietary adjustments, physical activity, rest, self-monitoring, consulting healthcare experts, and adhering to medication (AADE, 2017). These changes have enabled nurses to prescribe medications, enhancing health outcomes while reducing outpatient visits and unnecessary referrals. Nurses establish policies as advanced healthcare providers to conduct physical examinations and administer optimal patient care practices.
