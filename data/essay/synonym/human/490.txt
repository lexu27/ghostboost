The Nourishment Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) is established to tackle the matter of nourishment safety that worries many American inhabitants – consumers and producers. My coworker’s effort represents the stance that FSMA is not handling its ability to render food more secure. The peer talks about the substance of the law, the risk of foodborne sickness, food contamination, and puts forth arguments supporting the stance on the ineffectiveness of FSMA. The effort concentrates significantly on the reality that there is no proof that the clauses of the law can render food more wholesome even though it was accepted.
I do not think that FSMA is inefficient, and though the law has several drawbacks, I do not endorse a coworker’s stance. The impact of the law is already verified by the reality that it reinforces the accountability of producers for the caliber of products. The confirmation of FSMA’s efficacy is that due to it, producers, packers, and importers are taking specific measures for the safety of the populace (Yiannas, 2021). Furthermore, directing attention to the matter of food safety through FSMA is also crucial and impactful for future enhancements. Consequently, it is feasible to locate proof of the effectiveness of the law under deliberation.
Having reviewed the stances of the opposing sides of the discourse, I am inclined to contend about the favorable influence of FSMA on food caliber and public health. Food can be tainted at various phases of the supply chain. FSMA focuses on the initial point – producers and establishes specific requirements for them. Even though the hazard is still present at other sites, the law is a vital step for forthcoming security. It highlighted the issue, and in the future, society should anticipate other measures to enhance food safety.
