Preamble
Penned in the midst of the twentieth century, the novel A Confederacy of Fools remains pertinent in contemporary times. The tome discloses some of the characteristics of individuals who struggle to find their niche in their societies or the broader human community. Ignatius J. Reilly, the central figure in the narrative, is one of such persons who are unable to blend in. Some might observe that the man is merely one of the myriad denizens of New Orleans endeavoring to navigate life and seek contentment ("Literary Voyages"). In this regard, he is not an odd individual with slightly distinctive traits but a person grappling with a psychological ailment marked by clear signs. Ignatius can scarcely integrate himself into his society, although he must exert considerable effort due to financial challenges stemming from his reckless actions.
It has been extensively debated that Ignatius shares numerous characteristics with the creator of the book, as John Kennedy Toole similarly floundered in becoming a valued member of his community and American society (MacLauchlin). While the writer took his own life, unable to acclimate, he affords Ignatius an opportunity to prosper (Henninger 782). Ignatius J. Reilly can be viewed as a compelling representation of the conduct and decisions of individuals diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder as they endeavor to secure a place within their communities.
Ignatius and His Antisocial Personality at Home and in the Community
Self-Indulgence as an Indicator of the Disorder
Self-indulgence stands out as one of the most conspicuous traits of Ignatius, also serving as a primary symptom of antisocial personality disorder. Individuals diagnosed with this psychological condition tend to pamper themselves and adopt a hedonistic lifestyle, displaying scant regard for the emotions or needs of others (Maass 9). Such individuals strive to ensure fulfillment of their own requirements (financial resources, sustenance, and attention from others), achieving this objective even at the expense of others. They firmly believe that their needs must be gratified while disregarding other considerations.
This trait manifests in Ignatius through various behaviors, including his eating disorder and reluctance to procure gainful employment. Ignatius likens the necessity of earning a living and securing a job to being "cast out again into the abyss" (Toole 86). He favors perusing medieval texts, composing letters and contemplations, daydreaming, and watching films (Leighton 211). He demonstrates minimal concern for his mother's hardships and her financial backing, despite being a mature adult. His attitude towards food and beverages further underscores his lack of boundaries. He contends that "deprivation of food... directs all of one's superior impulses" (Toole 132). He pays scant regard to the needs of others, concentrating solely on his personal comforts, whether it be fine cuisine or appropriate attire. Evidently, such self-centered conduct indicates symptoms of antisocial personality disorder.
Conceit and Deception as Common Indications
Arrogance and deceitfulness stand out as common indicators of antisocial personality disorder. Arrogance closely aligns with self-indulgence, as arrogant individuals perceive themselves as superior to others, thereby justifying their self-centered focus. Individuals with antisocial personality disorder exhibit a high level of arrogance, which correlates with antisocial conduct (Stanton and Zimmerman 439). Such individuals deem it unnecessary to adhere to or heed advice or warnings from others. Individuals afflicted with this mental ailment eschew external norms and regulations, even if these entail criminal acts that may result in penalties (fines or imprisonment).
Ignatius embodies these traits and flouts numerous rules, norms, and laws throughout the narrative. Instead of vending merchandise, he consumes it, a behavior that deviates from the expected pattern (Toole 165). He exhibits no endeavor to perform his duties diligently, displaying rudeness and insulting potential clients. Rather than striving for a commendable start and financial stability, Ignatius aspires to hastily vend "five or six hot dogs, park the wagon somewhere, and attend the cinema" daily (Toole 164). He proves to be an indolent and irresponsible worker, precluding him from securing a decent or, ultimately, any occupation. Furthermore, he ridicules the aspirations of others to ascend the professional ranks and achieve success in their field (Slepov 14). This stance serves as another instance of Ignatius's antisocial behavior. He deems himself too elevated to partake in the mundane existence of individuals preoccupied with practical matters. Ignatius dreams of an idealized Medieval society juxtaposed with the debasement of contemporary times, despite his complete dependence on the fruits of the twentieth century - hot dogs, bathtubs, and cinema.
He is predisposed to flouting laws and attributing his transgressions to others. His fraudulent activities result from his arrogance and disregard for regulations. He contends that "the world recognizes only strength and force" as he brazenly replicates his employer's signature without remorse (Toole 55). He remains unrepentant while implicating an innocent woman in his misdeeds, viewing this act, from his vantage point, as a demonstration of strength and authority. Evidently, he exhibits disrespect towards the elderly and law enforcement officials. This behavior surfaces on the initial pages of the narrative when Ignatius engages in a heated dispute with a patrolman. These attitudes and behaviors collectively underscore the protagonist's willingness to engage in antisocial conduct.
Relationships with His Mother
One of the most telling aspects of Ignatius's life, with respect to his psychological condition, pertains to his interactions with his mother. Antisocial conduct is often marked by violence and invariably proves destructive (DeLamater et al. 345). It disrupts interpersonal relationships, diminishes social standing, and erodes one's character. Ignatius falls short of embodying the role of a loving or considerate son who could bring pride to his mother. He emerges as an abusive and manipulative middle-aged offspring who anticipates unwavering financial and practical assistance from his mother. His egotism and arrogance lead him to believe that his duty is "to keep her in her place" (Toole 5). He engages in verbal abuse towards his mother, failing to genuinely acknowledge her efforts. Moreover, he adopts a manipulative approach, emphasizing her obligation to confront the family's challenges as she is his parent. Clearly, this stance is unsuitable for a responsible mature individual.
Furthermore, he harbors perceptions that his mother instigates harm and distress, portraying himself as a devoted and caring son. For instance, he asserts in his writings that "that people learn to hate those who help them," a purported "truth of human nature" (Toole 135). He sincerely believes that he safeguards his mother's well-being, despite inadvertently causing turmoil and anguish to the elderly woman in need of care, empathy, and support.
Once more, instead of fostering genuine connections with his mother, Ignatius opts to disregard the elderly woman. The incapacity and reluctance to cultivate relationships with others, including family members, represent additional hallmarks of antisocial personality disorder (Maass 9). Such individuals distance themselves even from their closest kin, alienating them through their brutality and arrogance.
