In the previous decade, Chinese online businesses have expanded at a rapid pace. This is notable because, even though the cyber world in China is famously restricted by the Great Wall, there might be another aspect of the problem that has been somewhat neglected: the top three Chinese online service providers are also a mix or fusion in the global economies generally of the investment, ownership, and control system that sustains them (Jia & Winseck, 2018). The Chinese government's resolve to enhance the country's communication network and firm influence and power has propelled the rapid growth of the internet in China. Nonetheless, China's most recent stage of internet expansion has been prompted by a three-way interplay involving the State, online businesses, and foreign financial capital. Although these mechanisms are now substantially transforming the Chinese internet, they have not been adequately explored in scholarly publications. The term "financialization" contributes to the increasing importance of finance, financial markets, and investment companies in the operation of the economy. Financialization impacts both the macroeconomic circumstances and merges the characteristics by modifying the structure and functioning of financial markets as well as influencing corporate conduct and economic strategy. Financialization has also led to greater income growth in the financial sector compared to the rest of the economy. Financial crises can result in enduring lost income, have a severe impact on the impoverished, and elevate unemployment.
