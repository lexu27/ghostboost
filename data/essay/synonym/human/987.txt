Primary schooling for children in bilingual immigrant families can pose challenges for parents. They frequently encounter issues of cultural incongruity, meaning, a lack of comprehension of certain obvious norms and traditions. For instance, in the United States, it is standard for parents to participate in school events, whereas in South Korea, this conduct is viewed as impolite. Parents may also undergo emotional unease when interacting with educators due to language obstacles. Thus, family involvement is the most prevalent method to diminish the gap between educators and parents and enhance communication. This article aims to explore how family engagement and alternative teaching methods cater to the requirements of dual language learners.
Dual Language Learners and Family Engagement
Dual language learners (DLL) are pupils educated in a language distinct from the primary one spoken at their residences. Interestingly, these pupils often encounter a dissimilar cultural environment. DLLs typically are US-born offspring of immigrants, and at times of US-born guardians. The most populous immigrant communities in California are Spanish, Vietnamese, Korean, and Tagalog. As the immigrant population typically comprises a substantial portion of US citizens, there are prevalent educational methods specifically tailored for the DLLs. For example, the approach of family involvement was developed to enhance communication between DLLs' parents and educators.
The US educational system acknowledges the significance of the family in the learning process. Therefore, the notion of engagement was introduced at an early stage in the academic discourse regarding DLL learning techniques. The rationale behind this notion is to establish broader prospects for the families of pupils, that is, the perception of them as a robust partner with numerous opportunities. In other words, the contemporary US educational system is rooted in the belief that families possess more insights about children's education than the school syllabus. In this context, one of the primary objectives of the system is to set the stage for enhanced interaction between families and schools.
Equally critical are universally accepted concepts in the educational system such as cultural capital, social capital, and human capital, as well as the method founded on the fundamentals of ecological theory. Broadly, the ecological theory examines the developmental systems of children like proximal systems and distal systems. Proximal systems are the systems commonly encountered by learners like school and home, which form a tangible system in which the students operate. Concurrently, the distal system is the notion that portrays the more intangible, ideological facets of learning such as culture and neighborhoods.
There is also a notion that these two systems engage in a bidirectional interaction, which is also scrutinized. As per the theory, the sole approach to establish optimal learning is to synchronize the two systems. Subsequently, the concept of cultural capital embodies the notion of the cultural knowledge, beliefs, and traditions intrinsic among the family members of students. Simultaneously, social capital pertains to the social networks of the students as valuable assets of support and influence. Lastly, human capital is the concept delineating the personal attributes of students that aid them in succeeding in the learning process. These attributes may encompass the initial education, competencies, and skills, in addition to personal traits.
Scholarly Discussion
Scholars commonly acknowledge the family engagement strategy as appropriate and suggest ways to integrate this strategy within the school curriculum and lesson plans. For instance, Quin et al. (2018) acknowledge the importance of introducing the ecological model for students' learning development and consider the most pivotal factors inherent in the model, such as teacher's assistance that correlates positively with the student's engagement. The scholars also recognize the substantial influence exerted by the students' community, family, and peers. Quin et al. (2018) identified the factors deemed protective concerning academic success. These encompass teacher support, academic achievements, prior engagement, family management practices, among others. The risk factors entail antisocial peer associations, community disarray, school absenteeism, and dropout rates.
Though these factors were devised for the 10th and 11th graders, they are equally applicable to younger students, as they deliberate on the prevalent scenario of younger and older children receiving education. Interestingly, these factors could be incorporated into the initial and more broadly perceived family engagement strategy since, as per the scholars' findings, they exhibit considerable potential. The provided information can also be utilized to define the requisites and assessments of the students' success and to identify warning signs in students' academic performance. For instance, educators could devise questionnaires for parents where family members could respond to queries related to the presence or absence of risk factors or supportive elements.
Consultation is a viable form of family engagement in the learning process. Educators can offer valuable insights into which home-based family practices will be most effective for DLL students. For instance, there are prevalent and widely accepted practices or attributes of family engagement. These practices encompass joint decision-making, regular two-way communication, collaboration with educators, knowledge exchange, learning at home and in the community, and setting learning objectives in a joint family-program framework. Hence, consultations can be perceived as a feature of the reciprocal communication between educators and families.
Smith et al. (2019) affirm that consultations are a suitable means to promote family-school engagement. They manifest positive correlations with the children's social-behavioral competence, academic accomplishments, and mental well-being. Equally significant, consultations impact the relational outcomes, parental practices, and attitudes (Smith et al., 2019). Consequently, the scholars posit that there is compelling evidence that consultations enhance critical student outcomes. Importantly, this assertion also aligns with the family engagement strategy.
Given the substantial benefits of counseling for both educators and students, teachers should integrate weekly parental counseling in their curriculum and devise distinct programs to engage and motivate parents. The execution of such initiatives will foster an environment where children can receive support in learning both at home and school. Considering the prevalent challenges encountered by DLLs, this educational environment can serve as an indispensable prerequisite for the effective assimilation of new knowledge.
Teacher training programs are a specific factor that positively impacts DLLs' educational achievements. Interestingly, these practices can be viewed within the framework of the ecological theory as an intrinsic component of the proximal system, which typically encompasses students' family and school support structures. Smith and Sheridan (2017) explored how teacher-training practices (TTP) influence the social-emotional, behavioral, and academic progress of DLLs. The scholars highlighted that TTP also influenced the educators' knowledge, attitudes, and family engagement practices. The latter exhibited a strong positive correlation, underscoring the suggestion to adopt the TTP as a practical tool to enhance students' academic performance. Smith and Sheridan proposed considering TTP components like communication strategies, problem-solving, and collaborative planning to evolve future TTP practices. The practices scrutinized were professional development programs, teacher in-service programs, and preservice university courses. In light of the foregoing, school administrations should endorse educators' professional growth and establish the prerequisites for it. This may encompass specialized school-based courses and programs, devised in collaboration with the Ministry of Education or specific academic and expert entities. 
Sibley and Brabeck (2017) delved into the educational process concerning the advantages and accomplishments of Latino immigrant students. Not surprisingly, the scholars noted the constrained opportunities for children raised in immigrant households, particularly in terms of graduating from colleges and universities. They also emphasized that the setbacks could be traced back to primary education, underscoring the significance of educators' effective work with young students from immigrant families.
