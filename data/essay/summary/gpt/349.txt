Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries are significant as they can impact knee stability, often necessitating ACL reconstruction (ACLR) to restore function and prevent long-term issues. One common technique used in ACLR is the bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) autograft, known for its advantages in strength, reduced laxity, quicker rehabilitation, and high success rates over time.

While BPTB autografts offer various benefits, including robustness and positive outcomes, there are notable disadvantages to consider. Donor site complications, limited availability of suitable graft material, potential tibial fracture risk, graft site widening, and the risk of hamstring weakness are factors that must be weighed when choosing this approach for ACLR.

Complications following ACLR with BPTB autografts can include infections, graft failures, arthrofibrosis (excessive scar tissue formation within the joint), loss of knee extension, nerve or vessel damage, and even patellar fractures. These risks highlight the importance of meticulous attention to detail during surgery and comprehensive post-operative care to minimize adverse outcomes.

To mitigate the chances of complications, preventive strategies are crucial. These may involve rigorous sterilization procedures, strict adherence to rehabilitation protocols, gradual reintroduction to sporting activities, and addressing individual risk factors that could compromise the surgical outcome. By implementing these preventive measures, the likelihood of experiencing post-ACLR issues can be significantly reduced.

Despite the potential drawbacks and risks associated with BPTB autografts in ACLR, they remain a widely accepted and effective option due to their overall success rates and advantages. The decision to proceed with ACLR using a BPTB autograft should be made in consultation with orthopedic specialists, weighing the benefits against the potential complications to achieve the best possible long-term result for the patient.
