Judicial decisions are not solely based on the black and white letter of the law but are profoundly influenced by judges' personal experiences and the society they belong to. This subjective interpretation of the law poses a challenge to the presumed political neutrality of judges, as highlighted by Duncan Kennedy, who argues that judges cannot merely be seen as impartial 'umpires'. Instead, they are complex individuals with diverse backgrounds that inevitably influence their decision-making process.

Factors such as racial, gender, and class backgrounds play a significant role in shaping judges' cognitive processes and their understanding of legal principles. These personal experiences act as a lens through which the law is interpreted, leading to varying perspectives among judges. This tension between political neutrality and subjective interpretation creates a balancing act for judges, as they strive to maintain fairness and transparency within the judicial system.

While subjective interpretation may deviate from a strict application of the law, it can also lead to more equitable decisions that consider broader societal implications. These decisions, while potentially controversial, may address underlying injustices and promote a more just legal system. However, the challenge remains in ensuring that such decisions do not compromise the fundamental principles of fairness and objectivity in adjudication.

To mitigate concerns about fairness and objectivity, transparency mechanisms such as judicial reasoning and written judgments play a crucial role. By providing insights into the rationale behind decisions, these mechanisms enhance judicial accountability and promote consistency in the application of the law. Additionally, acknowledging and addressing the influence of personal experiences and social context can lead to a more self-aware and transparent judicial system.

In conclusion, judges' personal experiences and social context undeniably affect the fairness and objectivity of judicial decisions. While this subjective interpretation may challenge the notion of political neutrality, it also has the potential to lead to more just outcomes that consider societal implications. By embracing transparency and promoting self-awareness, the legal system can navigate the complexities of subjective interpretation to uphold the principles of fairness, objectivity, and justice.
