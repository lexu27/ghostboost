George F. Becker, a distinguished geologist, played a pivotal role in shaping the American perception of imperial expansion through his experiences in South Africa and the Philippines. Recognized as an influential educator among the American political elite, Becker heightened awareness regarding unfamiliar regions and their abundant resources. Emphasizing the mineral riches and strategic importance of South Africa and the Philippines, he underscored the economic opportunities for growth that these territories offered.

Becker significantly influenced the national narrative towards expansionism and advocated for the inclusion of new territories under American dominion. However, a critical examination of Becker's actions is imperative, particularly regarding his involvement in military operations and deliberate manipulation of reports. His engagement in military endeavors blurred the lines between scientific exploration and military conquest, raising concerns about the objectivity of his reports.

The deliberate distortion of reports by Becker aimed to legitimize American intervention in foreign lands, creating a skewed public perception of these actions. His participation in the Philippines during times of war sparked ethical dilemmas surrounding his collaboration with military officials and the intertwining of scientific and political agendas. The ethical implications of Becker's actions highlight the complexities surrounding the intersection of scientific research, political interests, and military endeavors in the context of imperial expansion.

In conclusion, George F. Becker's contributions to shaping American perceptions of imperial expansion through his geological expertise are undeniable. However, the scrutiny of his methods and motivations reveals a more nuanced narrative that underscores the ethical dilemmas and blurred boundaries inherent in the pursuit of national interests through territorial acquisition. Becker's legacy serves as a cautionary tale, prompting reflection on the intricate dynamics between science, politics, and military power in the context of imperial ambitions.
