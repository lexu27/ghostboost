Genghis Khan and Hulagu, despite their familial bond, exhibited vastly different methodologies in governing and expanding the Mongol Empire. Genghis Khan's approach was grounded in assimilation and cultural acceptance, advocating for the exchange of traditions and the freedom to practice various religions. Unlike Hulagu, who resorted to brutal tactics, Genghis Khan upheld conquered rulers' autonomy by having them pledge loyalty and pay tribute while still maintaining authority under his suzerainty.

In contrast, Hulagu, as the grandson of Genghis Khan, pursued conquest through a more destructive and tyrannical lens. His forces were notorious for massacring populations, razing cities to the ground, and exploiting conquered lands solely for economic gain. While Genghis Khan aimed for unity and progress by embracing diversity and collaboration, Hulagu's primary objectives were centered around amassing wealth and enforcing strict religious doctrines within his dominion.

The divergent strategies employed by Genghis Khan and Hulagu not only influenced their individual reigns but also left a lasting impact on the Mongol Empire's legacy. Genghis Khan's legacy was marked by stability, expansion, and the celebration of diverse cultures, whereas Hulagu's rule is remembered for its oppressive nature, ruthless conquests, and single-minded pursuit of material wealth. The dichotomy between their governance styles underscores the profound effects that leadership approaches can have on the historical trajectory of an empire, shaping the course of events and the perceptions of those who succeeded them.
