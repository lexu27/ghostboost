Fatigue is a prevalent symptom among individuals diagnosed with stable coronary heart disease (CHD), characterized by feelings of tiredness, lack of energy, and diminished physical and mental capabilities. This condition significantly impacts the quality of life of patients by restricting daily activities, leading to feelings of frustration, helplessness, and even depression. Moreover, fatigue in stable CHD patients influences their functional status by diminishing exercise capacity, reducing physical fitness levels, and increasing vulnerability to other health issues.

Various factors have been identified as contributors to fatigue in individuals with stable CHD, including traditional cardiac risk factors, comorbidities such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and anemia, psychological elements like depression and anxiety, lifestyle choices, and specific medications. To effectively address fatigue in these patients, a comprehensive approach is crucial. This multidimensional strategy involves targeting cardiac risk factors, managing comorbidities, addressing psychological concerns, promoting healthy lifestyle behaviors, and optimizing medication regimens.

Managing and controlling cardiac risk factors like hypertension and diabetes can have a positive impact on alleviating fatigue symptoms in patients with stable CHD. Psychological support plays a vital role in fatigue management, necessitating the screening and treatment of depression, anxiety, and stress to improve overall well-being and energy levels. Additionally, promoting a healthy lifestyle that includes regular physical activity, enhancing sleep quality, and ensuring proper nutrition intake are fundamental aspects of fatigue management in individuals with stable CHD.

In conclusion, fatigue poses a significant challenge for patients living with stable coronary heart disease, affecting both their quality of life and functional status. By adopting a holistic approach that addresses cardiac risk factors, comorbidities, psychological well-being, lifestyle choices, and medication optimization, healthcare providers can effectively manage fatigue and enhance the overall well-being of individuals with stable CHD.
