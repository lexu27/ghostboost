Throughout history, juvenile delinquency has been a persistent social issue that has been approached in varying ways by different societies. In Ancient Greece, the focus was on parental responsibility, where moral education and discipline were vital in addressing juvenile delinquency. Parents were seen as crucial in guiding their children towards proper behavior and societal norms.

Ancient Greece implemented strict punishment measures for juvenile offenders to deter crime and maintain order in society. The emphasis was on punishment rather than rehabilitation, with offenders often stigmatized for their actions. This approach aimed to instill fear in young individuals to prevent future criminal behavior.

Contrastingly, modern society recognizes the impact of external factors on a child's behavior and takes a more comprehensive approach to juvenile delinquency. Rather than solely blaming parents or the individual, the focus is on understanding the root causes of delinquent behavior. Rehabilitation is prioritized through education, therapy, and guidance to help young offenders reintegrate into society successfully.

In Ancient Greece, there was a tendency to blame parents for juvenile delinquency, leading to the stigmatization of offenders. The priority was on punishment rather than addressing the underlying issues that may have contributed to the delinquent behavior. However, modern society has shifted towards a more empathetic stance, emphasizing support, second chances, and restorative justice for juvenile offenders. The goal is not only to punish but also to help young individuals learn from their mistakes and become productive members of society.

The evolution of societal views and strategies from Ancient Greece to modern society demonstrates a significant shift towards a more compassionate and holistic approach to juvenile delinquency. This transition highlights the importance of understanding the complexities of delinquent behavior and the need for supportive interventions to address them effectively. By prioritizing rehabilitation and reintegration, society can help young offenders turn their lives around and contribute positively to their communities.
