Currency exchange rates play a crucial role in determining the profitability of international trade, necessitating a thorough analysis before making any decisions. For our company's trade operations in Malaysia, three main scenarios have been considered: adjusting for currency fluctuations, utilizing a fixed exchange rate in contracts, and bypassing currency exchange by procuring goods in MYR.

In the short term, adapting to currency fluctuations offers advantages such as mitigating adverse impacts and ensuring stable profit margins. However, continually adjusting prices based on currency variations in the long run could potentially result in customer confusion and erode trust among suppliers due to the inconsistency.

On the other hand, incorporating a fixed exchange rate in contracts offers stability and predictability in business transactions. This approach provides short-term benefits by safeguarding profitability and simplifying financial planning. Nevertheless, there are long-term risks associated with a fixed exchange rate, especially if the MYR experiences significant appreciation, leading to potential reductions in profit margins.

An alternative strategy involves avoiding currency exchange risks altogether by purchasing raw materials in MYR, thus eliminating exposure to exchange rate fluctuations and fostering stronger relationships with local suppliers. Despite its benefits, sourcing materials locally poses challenges related to availability, quality, and the possibility of import restrictions.

Considering the various scenarios, a combination of adjusting for currency fluctuations and procuring materials in local currency emerges as the most viable and profitable option for our company in both the short and long terms. This strategy allows for flexibility in responding to market dynamics while reducing exchange rate risks and strengthening partnerships with local suppliers.

In conclusion, the intricate interplay between currency exchange rates and international trade profitability underscores the importance of strategic decision-making in navigating the complexities of global business operations. By carefully weighing the advantages and risks of different approaches, our company can optimize its trade activities in Malaysia and position itself for sustainable growth and success in the ever-evolving international market landscape.
