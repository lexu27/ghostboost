Generation Z, defined as those born between the mid-1990s and early 2000s, is a demographic cohort heavily influenced by various societal developments that significantly shape their perspectives on relationships and marriage. External factors such as advancements in technology, changes in communication patterns, and the pervasive presence of social media platforms have revolutionized how Gen Z engages in romantic relationships. The widespread adoption of dating apps and increased online interactions have not only expanded the pool of potential partners for Gen Z but have also fostered a more pragmatic approach towards relationships.

Moreover, Gen Z exhibits a strong emphasis on values like equality, inclusivity, and a firm rejection of conventional gender roles within relationships. This progressive mindset underscores a fundamental shift in societal norms and expectations surrounding love and marriage. Internally, economic uncertainties and a prevailing focus on personal development significantly influence the attitudes of Gen Z towards the institution of marriage. The overarching theme of economic instability has instilled a sense of caution in Gen Z individuals, leading them to approach long-term commitments like marriage with increased skepticism.

Furthermore, Gen Z places a high premium on personal growth and the pursuit of career aspirations, often prioritizing these aspects over more traditional notions of relationships and marriage. This prioritization of individual goals over relationship milestones underscores a broader trend towards self-fulfillment and autonomy among members of this generation. The insights gleaned from the article "Are Gen Z more pragmatic about love and sex?" serve to corroborate the observations regarding the evolving attitudes of Generation Z towards relationships and marriage.
