Mary Midgley, a distinguished British philosopher, has left a significant mark on the field of moral philosophy with her insightful contributions. One of her notable works, "Trying Out One's New Sword," delves into critiquing moral isolationism while offering a fresh perspective on the assessment of various cultures. Moral isolationism, as described by Midgley, refers to the notion that one should refrain from making judgments about the moral practices of different cultures. However, Midgley challenges this stance, contending that moral isolationism actually obstructs the comprehension of diverse cultures and ethical evaluations.

Through compelling examples like the traditional 18th-century Japanese ritual of "trying out one's new sword" and the controversial practice of female genital mutilation, Midgley effectively illustrates her arguments against moral isolationism. She advocates for the existence of universal moral values, such as human rights, which should serve as the foundation for appraising cultural customs. Furthermore, Midgley introduces the concept of "moral progress" as an alternative method for comprehending and scrutinizing other cultures, emphasizing the pursuit of moral advancement rather than mere acceptance.

By promoting a critical approach towards cultural practices, Mary Midgley encourages individuals to strive for moral enhancement and development within a globalized society. Her valuable insights offer guidance on how to navigate the complexities of multicultural ethics, urging people to engage thoughtfully with diverse cultural perspectives. In essence, Midgley's work not only challenges the limitations of moral isolationism but also inspires a more enlightened and progressive outlook on cultural diversity and ethical evaluations in today's interconnected world.
