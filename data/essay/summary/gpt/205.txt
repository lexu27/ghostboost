Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Hardison was a significant case in the United States that delved into the intersection of employee rights and religious freedoms. The Court of Appeals grappled with various alternatives to accommodate Hardison's Seventh-Day Adventist faith but encountered practical and fairness concerns along the way. Prioritizing Hardison's shift preferences above others was deemed problematic as it would disrupt the balance and contradict the principle of equal treatment under the law. Furthermore, the proposal of hiring additional employees to cover Hardison's shifts presented financial implications and the risk of establishing a precedent for similar demands, ultimately impacting the overall efficiency of the company.

Moreover, the suggestion of allowing voluntary shift exchanges with Hardison raised apprehensions about potential discontent within the workforce and the subsequent negative impact on productivity in the long run. It became evident that granting Hardison special treatment could encroach upon the rights and preferences of other employees, thereby fostering an unjust work environment. The case highlighted the intricate task of balancing religious freedoms with fairness, emphasizing the importance of considering the needs of all individuals involved to uphold a harmonious workplace atmosphere.

Ultimately, the proposed alternatives in the case were deemed unviable in the long term due to their practical and fairness concerns. The court's decision reflected the complexity of navigating religious accommodations in the workplace while maintaining equity and efficiency. Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Hardison serves as a poignant reminder of the challenges in reconciling competing interests within the realm of employee rights and religious liberties, underscoring the necessity of thoughtful and balanced decision-making to ensure a just and inclusive work environment for all.
