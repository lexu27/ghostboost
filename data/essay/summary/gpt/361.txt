The Internet of Things (IoT) has significantly transformed the way we interact with technology, establishing a network where devices seamlessly exchange data. However, this advancement also brings forth security challenges stemming from the extensive array of interconnected devices with varying security levels, limited resources, and diverse vulnerabilities. The immense volume of personal and sensitive data collected and transmitted by IoT devices raises concerns regarding data privacy. 

One of the major security risks associated with IoT devices is the lack of proper authentication and access control, leaving them susceptible to malicious attacks. End-users face a range of security threats such as invasion of privacy, data breaches leading to financial loss, and potential disruptions to critical systems and networks. To address these risks, there is a proposal to develop safety ratings for IoT devices using the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP).

The use of AHP enables a methodical evaluation and prioritization of security attributes, facilitating the creation of safety ratings that are easily understandable for consumers. These safety ratings serve as a guide for consumers when making purchasing decisions, allowing them to select devices based on security features that align with their needs. Additionally, these ratings incentivize manufacturers to prioritize security in their products, ultimately enhancing overall IoT security over time.

By constructing safety ratings using AHP, the aim is to establish understandable security standards that can aid in mitigating the security challenges posed by IoT devices. This approach not only empowers consumers to make informed choices but also encourages manufacturers to enhance the security of their products, leading to an overall improvement in IoT security.
