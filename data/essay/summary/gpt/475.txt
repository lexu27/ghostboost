The aging population is expanding at a rapid pace, necessitating a deeper comprehension of how age influences drug therapy for older adults concerning pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic processes. Pharmacokinetics delves into the movement of drugs within the body, while pharmacodynamics explores how drugs interact with specific target sites to elicit effects. Age-related alterations, such as diminished renal and hepatic function, can influence drug absorption, metabolism, distribution, and excretion, potentially leading to adverse reactions in the elderly. Changes in body composition, including muscle depletion and increased adipose tissue, can modify drug distribution and effectiveness in older individuals. Gastrointestinal transformations in seniors, such as delayed gastric emptying and pH variations, can impact drug absorption and therapeutic results.

Healthcare professionals should routinely assess renal and hepatic function in older patients and opt for medications that exert less strain on these organs to ensure safer treatment. Educating patients is paramount for older adults to grasp age-related changes and comply with medication regimens for improved therapeutic outcomes. Profound comprehension of age-related modifications in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics is crucial for enhancing drug therapy in older adults by making appropriate adaptations and conducting vigilant monitoring.
