The portrayal of whiteness in film, television, and media has been a deeply ingrained issue that influences how race and identity are perceived in society. While there have been advancements in showcasing diverse perspectives, there remains a significant gap in achieving equitable representation across various platforms. One notable film that challenges the traditional narrative is "Get Out," which offers an African-American viewpoint in a genre typically dominated by white stories. By subverting stereotypes such as the white savior trope, the film effectively sheds light on the pitfalls of assuming benevolent whiteness.

In contrast, movies like "The Dark Knight" subtly reinforce the connection between authority, heroism, and whiteness, often casting individuals of color in secondary roles. These skewed representations not only perpetuate racial hierarchies but also contribute to feelings of inadequacy among marginalized groups, reinforcing harmful stereotypes in the process. However, recent cinematic works like "Moonlight" and "Black Panther" have been instrumental in advocating for more inclusive narratives that challenge the notion of whiteness as the default standard.

Initiatives like "#OscarsSoWhite" have played a crucial role in bringing attention to the lack of diversity within the film industry, sparking essential dialogues on the importance of representation and inclusivity. By highlighting the need for greater diversity in Hollywood, these movements push for structural changes that can pave the way for a more equitable and representative media landscape. Despite the progress made, there is still a significant journey ahead to ensure that all voices are heard and valued in the realm of entertainment.
