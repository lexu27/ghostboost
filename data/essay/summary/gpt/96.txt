The film "Before Night Falls," directed by Julian Schnabel, delves into the life of Reinaldo Arenas, a celebrated Cuban writer, with a strong emphasis on his sexual orientation. Arenas' journey as a homosexual man was profoundly influenced by various social factors prevalent in Cuban society. The stigmatization and outright prohibition of homosexuality in Cuba played a crucial role in shaping Arenas' identity in a society where such differences were not widely accepted.

Within the cultural backdrop of machismo culture under Fidel Castro's regime, traditional gender roles were strictly enforced, adding pressure on individuals like Arenas to adhere to societal norms. Despite this challenging environment, personal experiences during Arenas' formative years, including intimate relationships with other boys, significantly contributed to the development of his sexual orientation.

Arenas found solace and acceptance within the artistic and intellectual circles of Havana, where diverse sexual orientations were more openly embraced. These social circles provided him with the freedom to explore and express his homosexuality without fear of severe repercussions, allowing him to truly be himself.

Crucial personal relationships, such as those with his close friend Pepe and the Swedish poet Olof, played a pivotal role in helping Arenas navigate and accept his sexuality. These connections offered him support, understanding, and a sense of belonging in a world where his identity was often marginalized and condemned.

The film poignantly illustrates the struggles and conflicts Arenas faced due to societal norms and restrictions imposed by the Cuban Revolution, hindering his ability to fully engage in romantic relationships without fear or constraints. Arenas' sexual orientation was a complex interplay of social and cultural influences, personal encounters, and intimate relationships, underscoring the intricate web of factors that shape one's sexual identity.

In essence, "Before Night Falls" paints a vivid portrait of Reinaldo Arenas' life, highlighting the profound impact of societal expectations, personal experiences, and meaningful relationships on his journey towards self-acceptance as a homosexual man. Through his story, the film sheds light on the intricate interplay between external influences and internal struggles in the formation of one's sexual identity.
