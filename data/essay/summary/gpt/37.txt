Amazon, a prominent e-commerce giant, grapples with significant challenges concerning the treatment of its employees, which in turn leads to issues such as job dissatisfaction and remarkably high turnover rates. The dissatisfaction experienced by workers at Amazon stems from various factors including extended working hours, demanding performance targets, and a noticeable absence of work-life balance. These conditions not only affect employee morale and contentment but also contribute to a surge in turnover intentions among the workforce.

The high turnover rates witnessed at Amazon can be linked to the inherently demanding nature of the job roles within the company, coupled with a perceived lack of acknowledgment and appreciation for the efforts put in by employees. Consequently, this diminishes the overall level of organizational commitment among the workforce, leading to a concerning trend of instability within the company's human resources.

To address the pressing issue of job dissatisfaction and high turnover rates, a proposed solution involves the adoption of conservative motivation frameworks such as the Two-Factor Theory and social exchange theory. The Two-Factor Theory places emphasis on hygiene factors like the quality of working conditions, job security, and interpersonal relationships, aiming to prevent dissatisfaction among employees by ensuring these fundamental needs are met adequately. On the other hand, social exchange theory posits that maintaining fairness in the reciprocal relationship between employees and the organization can enhance motivation levels and consequently reduce turnover rates significantly.

Despite the potential efficacy of these strategies, challenges exist in their implementation within Amazon's vast operational scale. The necessity for consistent application of these frameworks across the organization, coupled with the likelihood of resistance from management that prioritizes productivity metrics over employee well-being, poses significant obstacles to the successful execution of these solutions.

In light of these challenges, it becomes increasingly vital for Amazon to prioritize the well-being and motivation of its employees to secure long-term success. By concentrating on rectifying the underlying issues that contribute to job dissatisfaction and high turnover rates, Amazon can foster a more positive and sustainable work environment that not only benefits its employees but also bolsters the company's overall performance and reputation in the market.
