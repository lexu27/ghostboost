The study conducted by Khoshaim et al. delves into the anxiety levels experienced by university students in Saudi Arabia amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Through a survey involving 500 university students, various anxiety symptoms, the fear of contracting COVID-19, and the repercussions on both academic and social aspects were brought to light. A notable finding was that a significant proportion of students exhibited heightened anxiety attributed to concerns such as the fear of the virus itself, prevailing uncertainty, disruptions in academic routines, and limited social interactions. Interestingly, the research revealed that female students tended to report higher levels of anxiety in comparison to their male counterparts.

This study is instrumental in enhancing our comprehension of how the pandemic has influenced the mental well-being of Saudi Arabian university students. By contributing to the existing literature on the psychological impacts of the pandemic across diverse cultural and socio-economic settings, it underscores the necessity for targeted interventions and support services to effectively combat escalating anxiety levels in this demographic. Moreover, the findings emphasize the pivotal role of understanding the pandemic's mental health ramifications for policymakers and educators. This understanding is crucial in the development of tailored strategies aimed at promoting the overall well-being of students in the face of unprecedented challenges brought about by the pandemic.
