Lookism and extreme body modification are two interconnected issues that highlight the bias and discrimination prevalent in society based on physical appearance. This bias stems from the perception that beauty equates to success, power, and desirability, leading to negative judgments and stereotypes. Individuals resort to extreme body modifications like plastic surgery, tattoos, or piercings in a bid to conform to societal beauty standards, driven by the pressures imposed by unrealistic ideals propagated by the media.

These societal standards predominantly affect women, subjecting them to immense pressure to adhere to narrow beauty norms. The result is often body dissatisfaction and a yearning for drastic appearance changes, reflecting the influence of unhealthy beauty standards. Goode's book delves into the social construction of beauty ideals, revealing how deviations from these norms can lead to marginalization, negative body image, and a surge in extreme modifications.

The phenomena of lookism and extreme body modification underscore the impact of societal expectations and pressures, perpetuated through media and cultural influences. Society's emphasis on physical attractiveness further exacerbates these issues, necessitating a shift towards more inclusive, accepting, and healthy beauty standards. Goode's work emphasizes the urgency for change in societal beauty norms, advocating for the promotion of inclusivity and fostering a positive body image environment for all individuals. It is imperative for society to move towards embracing diverse forms of beauty and rejecting rigid standards that perpetuate negativity and exclusion.
