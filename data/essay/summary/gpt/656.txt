The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected university students worldwide, with a notable impact on those in Saudi Arabia. Research conducted by Khoshaim et al. (2020) highlighted that Saudi university students faced notably higher levels of anxiety amidst the pandemic. This increased anxiety was attributed to various factors including the shift to online learning, feelings of social isolation, fears of contracting the virus, and financial stressors.

While the study shed light on the heightened anxiety levels among Saudi students, it also had its limitations. These limitations included the use of self-reported data, a relatively small sample size, and a lack of exploration into potential mediating factors that could influence anxiety levels during the pandemic. Despite these constraints, the findings emphasized the critical need for prioritizing mental health support and resources for students.

To address the mental health challenges faced by university students, institutions should enhance access to counseling services, establish online support groups, and launch mental health awareness campaigns. Moreover, educators play a crucial role in supporting students by adapting teaching methods to accommodate the difficulties faced by students, such as adjusting academic expectations and deadlines.

Creating a comprehensive support system requires collaborative efforts from universities, government bodies, and mental health professionals. Tailored support systems tailored to address the unique mental health challenges encountered by Saudi university students are imperative. By acknowledging and tackling these challenges, universities can play a pivotal role in safeguarding the mental well-being and academic success of students during the ongoing pandemic.
