Roosevelt strongly believed that progressivism was not just a political strategy but a moral obligation as well. He stressed the importance of moving away from excessive individualism towards a sense of collective responsibility. In his advocacy, Roosevelt pushed for the regulation of large corporations, the safeguarding of consumer rights, and the dissolution of monopolies to ensure fair competition. Additionally, progressivism under his guidance extended to social reforms encompassing improvements in education, healthcare, and labor rights. Furthermore, political reforms were deemed essential to tackle corruption and enhance government transparency within the system. Roosevelt's charismatic leadership and persuasive rhetoric were instrumental in instilling a sense of belief and driving action in support of progressivism as a transformative movement for a better society.
