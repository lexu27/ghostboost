The outbreak of the Second World War marked a devastating period that spread across nations globally, leaving a trail of destruction and chaos in its wake. During the 1930s, the United States followed an isolationist foreign policy stance, a decision that significantly limited its role in international affairs and impeded its ability to avert the impending war. The country's economic influence was also curtailed by the lingering effects of the Great Depression, further constraining its capacity to intervene effectively in conflicts erupting around the world. Despite these challenges, the US overlooked several opportunities to contain the escalating tensions, such as refraining from joining the League of Nations, which could have provided a platform for early intervention.

A contrasting approach, entailing a more proactive foreign policy agenda and extending economic aid to allied nations, might have reshaped the trajectory of events leading up to the outbreak of war. By embracing a more interventionist stance and bolstering diplomatic ties with other nations, the United States held the potential to influence the course of events and potentially prevent the catastrophic consequences of the Second World War. Active participation in international organizations and robust engagement in diplomatic efforts could have offered avenues to mitigate the underlying causes of the conflict and foster greater collaboration among nations.

The causes of World War II were intricate and multi-dimensional, stemming from a combination of political, economic, and social factors that intertwined to create a volatile global environment. Identifying a singular factor that could have completely averted the war remains a challenging task due to the complex web of circumstances that fueled its eruption. Nevertheless, by adopting alternative approaches that emphasized cooperation, diplomacy, and proactive intervention, the United States could have played a pivotal role in deterring the catastrophic events that unfolded during the Second World War.
