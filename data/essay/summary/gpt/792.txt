In today's modern educational system, the prevalence of information overload and multitasking has contributed to strained relationships among schools, students, parents, and teachers. This strain manifests in increased stress levels, a sense of disconnection, and hindered communication, ultimately impacting students' educational experiences and achievements. To address these challenges, implementing structured schedules has been identified as a beneficial approach to assist students in prioritizing tasks and managing stress associated with information overload and multitasking.

Moreover, establishing open and frequent communication channels between students, parents, and teachers is crucial for creating a supportive and collaborative environment within educational institutions. By fostering an atmosphere that values balance, well-being, and the development of diverse skills, schools can effectively mitigate the negative effects of information overload and multitasking, thus promoting students' holistic growth.

By integrating structured schedules and nurturing supportive cultures, educational institutions can alleviate stress, enhance communication, and improve students' academic outcomes. It is imperative for schools to prioritize the well-being and success of students in today's fast-paced world. Through a concerted effort to address the challenges posed by information overload and multitasking, educational stakeholders can work together to create a more conducive learning environment that fosters student development and achievement.
