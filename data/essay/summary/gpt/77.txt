Jainism, an ancient Indian religion dating back to the 6th century BCE, holds the distinction of being one of the oldest living religions globally. Founded by Mahavira, Jainism stands out due to its unique beliefs and ethical principles, setting it apart from other religions. One of the fundamental aspects of Jainism is its rejection of the concept of a Creator or God, instead emphasizing individual responsibility through the law of karma.

Central to Jainism are the principles of self-discipline, self-control, and self-realization, which are considered essential for achieving liberation from the cycle of birth and death. Non-violence, known as ahimsa, holds a pivotal position in Jain philosophy, promoting equality and advocating for the protection of all life forms. Consequently, Jains adhere to strict vegetarian diets and actively participate in charitable acts and environmental conservation efforts.

Despite its emphasis on peace and compassion, Jainism's rejection of a Creator and strong stance on non-violence can lead to controversies with other religions and philosophies. However, it is these unique origins, beliefs, and ethical principles that contribute to Jainism's contrasting worldview. Jainism's focus on fostering peace, compassion, and respect for all beings underscores its enduring significance in the religious tapestry of the world.
