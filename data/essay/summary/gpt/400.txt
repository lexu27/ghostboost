The CALM Act of 2012 was introduced to address the issue of excessively loud commercials on television. This Act mandates that broadcasters maintain consistent volume levels between programs and advertisements, aiming to provide viewers with a more pleasant and uninterrupted viewing experience. One of the key benefits of the CALM Act is the elimination of the need for viewers to constantly adjust the volume during commercial breaks, leading to a smoother transition between content.

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is responsible for enforcing compliance with the CALM Act, which has increased accountability among broadcasters to adhere to the regulations set forth by the Act. However, there are limitations to the effectiveness of the CALM Act, such as its exclusion of streaming platforms and online advertisements. This gap in coverage allows advertisers to circumvent the regulations, impacting the overall effectiveness of the Act.

Furthermore, the CALM Act does not address the issue of loud programs or content within television shows that can disrupt viewer experiences. Additionally, advertisers have found ways to adapt during the COVID-19 pandemic, utilizing techniques like dynamic range compression to bypass the regulations imposed by the Act.

To enhance the regulations and ensure a better viewing experience for audiences, policymakers should consider updating the CALM Act to encompass all advertising platforms, including streaming services and online ads. By addressing these audio-related concerns and enforcing stricter guidelines, policymakers can work towards creating a more consistent and enjoyable viewing environment for television audiences.
