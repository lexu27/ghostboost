Diagnostic errors pose a significant threat to patient safety, underscoring the crucial need for healthcare professionals, particularly nurses, to actively participate in the diagnostic process. Nurses play a pivotal role in mitigating diagnostic errors by offering valuable insights, diligently documenting symptoms, and fostering collaboration among various healthcare team members. However, nurses encounter several barriers that impede their full engagement in the diagnostic process, such as hierarchical structures, limited communication channels, and time constraints. 

To enhance nurses' participation and address these barriers, several solutions can be implemented. Firstly, there is a pressing need to promote a cultural shift within healthcare settings that prioritizes interdisciplinary collaboration and values the contributions of nurses in the diagnostic process. Additionally, the adoption of standardized protocols can streamline communication and ensure that crucial information is effectively shared among team members, thereby reducing the likelihood of diagnostic errors. Allocating dedicated time specifically for nurses to actively engage in the diagnostic process is also essential in maximizing their involvement and leveraging their expertise.

Nurses' unique expertise, keen observations, and comprehensive assessments are invaluable assets in enhancing patient safety and improving healthcare outcomes by minimizing diagnostic errors. By harnessing nurses' contributions and actively involving them in the diagnostic process, healthcare institutions can create a more robust system that prioritizes accuracy, efficiency, and ultimately, patient well-being. Overall, recognizing and addressing the barriers that hinder nurses' engagement in the diagnostic process while implementing collaborative solutions are essential steps towards enhancing patient safety and reducing diagnostic errors in healthcare settings.
