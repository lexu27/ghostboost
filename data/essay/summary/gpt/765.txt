The media holds a powerful sway over public opinion, shaping perceptions and beliefs. However, its accuracy in depicting African-Americans has long been a subject of scrutiny. Media bias frequently results in oversimplified portrayals of African-Americans, particularly evident in crime-related reporting. This bias is further fueled by governmental influence and the shadows of historical discrimination, perpetuating the underrepresentation of African-Americans in media. Tokenism, another pitfall, only serves to reinforce stereotypes and stifle diverse viewpoints. To rectify these issues, newsrooms must undergo restructuring to cultivate diversity and inclusivity. Journalists must undergo anti-bias training and engage with communities to ensure their reporting is truly reflective of all voices. While progress has been achieved, challenges persist in ensuring the accurate representation of marginalized communities. Moving forward, the media must strive for fairness, confront biases, and amplify a multitude of voices to cultivate well-informed dialogues.
