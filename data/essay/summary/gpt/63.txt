Adorno's concept of industrial culture portrays media products for children as tools that serve to propagate capitalist values and instill consumerist tendencies. These forms of entertainment, spanning from children's TV programs to movies, are crafted with the primary intention of generating revenue for corporations while concurrently molding children into passive consumers. Adorno's viewpoint resonates with the Marxist disapproval of capitalism, asserting that popular children's franchises, exemplified by the "Frozen" series, transcend mere amusement by actively endorsing consumer products through extensive merchandise lines.

In stark contrast, structural functionalism presents an opposing stance, underscoring the beneficial role of media products in meeting children's developmental and educational requirements. Productions like "Sesame Street" are commended for their ability to nurture learning and foster social growth in young viewers. Moreover, structural functionalism accentuates the media's capacity to unify society by weaving cultural narratives and fostering shared experiences among individuals.

Though both perspectives acknowledge the pervasive influence of capitalism in the realm of media creation, they diverge in their assessments of the broader implications on society and the younger demographic. Adorno's critical outlook underscores the detrimental effects of capitalist agendas on children's media consumption, positing it as a mechanism for perpetuating consumer culture. Conversely, structural functionalism maintains a more optimistic view, asserting that media products play a pivotal role in catering to children's developmental needs while concurrently facilitating societal cohesion through shared cultural experiences.
