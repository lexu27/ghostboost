The XVII century marked a significant period where Neo-Confucian ideologies wielded influence over the societal norms of China, Japan, and the Ottoman Empire. In China, women were subordinated under the patriarchal Neo-Confucian regime, facing constraints like the practice of foot-binding, which symbolized their subservience. Similarly, Japan imposed rigid societal expectations on women, stressing obedience and confinement to domestic duties. In contrast, the Ottoman Empire, guided by Islamic principles, afforded women relatively more opportunities compared to their counterparts in China and Japan.

Despite the nuanced differences, all three regions shared a common thread of imposing societal expectations on women, regulating their behavior and defining their roles within the societal framework. Confucianism's portrayal of women as intellectually inferior reinforced the narrative of their domestic obligations, thereby limiting their autonomy and opportunities for personal growth. Women in China and Japan found solace in engaging in refined arts, seeking avenues for self-expression within the boundaries set by society, while the Ottoman Empire emphasized the concept of the harem, showcasing a distinct approach to women's roles and status.

Overall, the Neo-Confucian regimes prevalent in these regions curtailed women's mobility and access to education, confining them to the sphere of domesticity. The experiences of women in China, Japan, and the Ottoman Empire serve as poignant reminders of the profound impact of Neo-Confucian ideologies on shaping gender roles and perpetuating societal disparities. It is imperative to undertake a critical evaluation of these ingrained societal expectations to pave the way for gender equality, challenging traditional norms and advocating for inclusivity and empowerment across all spheres of life. By critically assessing and redefining societal norms, we can strive towards a more equitable and just future for all individuals, transcending historical constraints and embracing a more progressive and inclusive worldview.
