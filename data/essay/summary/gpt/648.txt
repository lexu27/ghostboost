The portrayal of women in film often reinforces traditional gender roles and dominance-submission patterns, as exemplified in "The Postman Always Rings Twice" and "The Dark Knight Rises" through the male gaze theory and psychoanalysis. Male gaze theory suggests that women are objectified as passive objects of desire in films, controlled by male directors. In "The Postman Always Rings Twice", Cora's sexual allure is emphasized, reinforcing dominance-submission patterns. Psychoanalysis, based on Freud's theories, shows how women are limited by cultural expectations, as seen in "The Dark Knight Rises".

The melodrama genre accentuates family dynamics and emotional vulnerability, further restricting women's agency. Both films depict women facing limitations within family structures that reinforce male dominance. It is evident that filmmakers need to challenge these tropes and aim for more empowering portrayals of women in cinema. Succeeding in this endeavor would not only lead to more diverse and authentic representations on screen but also pave the way for a more inclusive and equitable film industry. By breaking free from the confines of traditional gender roles and dominance-submission dynamics, cinema has the potential to shape and reflect a more progressive and enlightened society.
