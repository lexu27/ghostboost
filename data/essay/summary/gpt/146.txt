Chronic inflammation poses a significant health challenge for individuals with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who are undergoing dialysis treatment. This persistent condition is exacerbated by the accumulation of middle molecules, such as Î²2-microglobulin, in ESRD patients. The inadequate clearance of these middle molecules by the impaired kidneys contributes to chronic inflammation along with oxidative stress. These factors not only trigger inflammation but also increase the risk of cardiovascular mortality, immune dysfunction, and malnutrition in individuals with ESRD.

Inflammatory markers like C-reactive protein serve as valuable indicators, predicting poor clinical outcomes in ESRD patients. Moreover, the buildup of middle molecules plays a role in dialysis-related amyloidosis, a condition that leads to joint problems in ESRD patients. Recognizing the detrimental effects of chronic inflammation, recent research in dialysis has focused on innovative methods such as hemodiafiltration to alleviate inflammation and enhance clinical outcomes for ESRD individuals.

Advances in dialyzer membrane technology have also contributed to managing chronic inflammation by improving the removal of middle molecules. By targeting the clearance of these molecules, dialysis treatment can potentially reduce the burden of chronic inflammation in ESRD patients. These technological developments aim to address the underlying causes of inflammation and enhance the overall well-being of individuals undergoing dialysis for ESRD, signaling promising progress in the field of renal care.
