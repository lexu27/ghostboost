In Olga Tokarczuk's novel, "Drive Your Plow over the Bones of the Dead," the protagonist, Janina, stands out for her unconventional approach to naming people in her village. Janina's use of nicknames like Oddball, Bigfoot, and Dizzy serves as a means to subvert societal norms and convey her deeply held values. Through assigning these unconventional monikers, Janina challenges the traditional constructs of identity and underscores the importance of individuality.

By blurring the distinctions between humans and animals through her naming practice, Janina advocates for a sense of equality and coexistence among all beings. Her refusal to adhere to conventional naming conventions reflects a broader resistance to the artificiality embedded within society and prompts readers to question the significance and power inherently tied to names.

Within the novel, the contrast between formal names and the nicknames Janina bestows upon others offers a glimpse into her philosophical perspective regarding the interconnectedness of humans and animals. Through Janina's chosen nomenclature, the narrative delves into complex themes of individuality, compassion, and inclusivity, urging readers to reconsider preconceived notions of superiority and hierarchy.

Janina's use of nicknames functions as a narrative tool to express her worldview, emphasizing the intrinsic value of all living creatures. Through this practice, she not only showcases the depth of individuality but also challenges entrenched beliefs surrounding human exceptionalism. Ultimately, the novel invites readers to adopt a more empathetic and holistic outlook towards both humans and animals, fostering a deeper understanding of the interconnected tapestry of life.
