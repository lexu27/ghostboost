Literature has long been fascinated with the ethical dilemmas surrounding scientific advancements, a theme vividly explored in iconic works like "The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" and "Frankenstein." These literary masterpieces delve into the dark underbelly of scientific progress, illustrating how unchecked pursuit of knowledge can lead to violence and a compromise of integrity.

In Robert Louis Stevenson's "The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde," Dr. Jekyll's experiment initially seeks to resolve moral conflicts by separating the dual nature of man. However, as the story unfolds, it becomes evident that his scientific hubris only unleashes a series of unforeseen and malevolent consequences. The novella serves as a cautionary tale about the perils of tampering with nature without considering the ethical implications.

Similarly, Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein" portrays Victor Frankenstein as a cautionary figure, embodying the dangers of unbridled scientific ambition and the disregard for moral responsibilities. His relentless pursuit of knowledge and his manipulation of life itself result in catastrophic outcomes, highlighting the destructive potential of science when wielded without ethical considerations.

Both Dr. Jekyll and Victor Frankenstein exploit their scientific breakthroughs for personal gain, ultimately leading to disastrous outcomes that affect not only themselves but also those around them. The novels underscore the importance of ethical boundaries in scientific exploration and warn against the consequences of unfettered scientific curiosity.

Through the narratives of these two iconic works, readers are reminded of the dual nature of science - a force capable of incredible advancements and yet equally capable of immense destruction. They serve as a powerful reminder of the ethical responsibilities that accompany scientific progress and caution against the unchecked pursuit of knowledge that disregards moral considerations.

In conclusion, "The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" and "Frankenstein" stand as timeless classics that continue to resonate with audiences, offering profound insights into the ethical implications of scientific innovation. These works serve as a poignant reminder of the delicate balance between scientific advancement and moral responsibility, urging society to approach progress with caution and conscientiousness.
