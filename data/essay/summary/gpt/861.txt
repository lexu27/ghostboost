Cultural protectionism in Canada has been a topic of debate due to its potential impacts on growth and competitiveness in global markets. While the intention behind protective measures is to preserve local culture and industries, it is argued that such policies may inadvertently hinder progress. Restrictive regulations could limit consumer choice, impede international creativity, and stifle innovation by creating barriers to entry for foreign players.

Moreover, discouraging foreign investments as a result of protectionist policies may lead to a loss of employment opportunities and reduced revenue for the country. By shielding local creators from global competition, there is a risk of fostering complacency and diminishing the drive for innovation and excellence. Embracing globalization, on the other hand, could stimulate healthy competition, pushing Canadian artists to strive for excellence on a global scale.

In addition to economic implications, cultural protectionism could create divisions within society and impede efforts to promote inclusivity and diversity in Canada. Instead, promoting diversity through cultural exchange can not only enhance diplomatic relations but also elevate Canada's global reputation as a multicultural and inclusive nation.

It is suggested that Canada should strike a balance between protecting its cultural heritage and embracing globalization. By focusing on promoting cultural awareness and education, the country can preserve its identity while also engaging with the world at large. This approach allows for the preservation of cultural heritage while encouraging innovation and competitiveness in the global arena.
