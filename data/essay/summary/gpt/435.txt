The 17th century marked a pivotal era of colonial conquest in the Americas, significantly altering the status and roles of native and African women within these societies. The intrusion of European colonial powers brought about profound disruptions to the social and economic structures of indigenous tribes. As a result, native women found themselves marginalized and relegated to domestic duties, stripped of their previous roles and autonomy.

One of the most impactful changes that native women experienced was the coercion to convert to Christianity, a tactic employed to erode their cultural practices and traditional autonomy. This forced assimilation further diminished their standing in society and undermined their sense of identity and agency. Similarly, African women within tribes like Fetu and Bakongo faced varying roles, with those in slave status enduring severe limitations on their autonomy and rights.

The social hierarchies and norms imposed by European colonizers played a significant role in shaping the experiences of women in colonial societies. The prevalent patriarchal norms of the Europeans directly influenced the roles and expectations placed upon native women, reinforcing gender inequalities and restricting their freedoms.

Despite these challenges, some women demonstrated remarkable resilience and agency in the face of colonial oppression. Queen Njinga of Kongo stands out as a powerful example of resistance against Portuguese colonization, showcasing the strength and determination of African women in defending their land and people.

Overall, the impact of colonial conquest on women's roles during the 17th century cannot be understated. It reshaped labor patterns, trade dynamics, and the autonomy of women, leaving a lasting imprint on their lives. The diverse experiences of native and African women highlight the intricate power dynamics and complexities that defined the era of colonial expansion, shedding light on the multifaceted implications of conquest on gender roles and societal structures.
