The character's complexity mirrors the delicate balance required in the pursuit of knowledge and power, emphasizing the necessity of responsibility and ethical considerations. Frankenstein's story ultimately serves as a cautionary reminder of the triumphs and tragedies that can result from losing sight of one's humanity in the relentless pursuit of scientific achievement.
