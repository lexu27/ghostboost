Intraoperative hypotension, a condition characterized by low blood pressure during surgery, is influenced by various factors that impact blood pressure regulation through physiological mechanisms. Anesthesia-related factors, patient-related factors, and surgical factors can all contribute to the development of intraoperative hypotension. Such hypotension not only poses immediate risks during surgery but also leads to postoperative complications and increased mortality rates. Complications associated with intraoperative hypotension include acute kidney injury, myocardial injury, stroke, and cognitive dysfunction, highlighting the critical importance of maintaining optimal blood pressure levels during surgery.

Several risk factors have been identified that predispose individuals to intraoperative hypotension. These risk factors include advanced age, a history of hypotensive episodes, undergoing emergency surgery, susceptibility to tissue ischemia, anemia, hypovolemia, and the use of certain medications. Recognizing these risk factors is essential for healthcare providers to proactively address and manage intraoperative hypotension in at-risk patients.

Central to the management of intraoperative hypotension is the monitoring and maintenance of mean arterial pressure (MAP) to ensure adequate tissue perfusion. Inadequate MAP levels have been strongly linked to adverse postoperative outcomes, emphasizing the need for vigilant blood pressure management during surgery. The incidence of intraoperative hypotension can vary, affecting a significant proportion of non-cardiac surgery patients and contributing to heightened mortality rates and complications in this population.

Anesthetic medications play a pivotal role in the development of intraoperative hypotension. Agents such as volatile anesthetics, hypnotics, and opioids can disrupt blood pressure regulation mechanisms, further increasing the susceptibility of patients to hypotensive episodes during surgery. Understanding the impact of these medications on blood pressure dynamics is crucial for anesthesiologists and healthcare teams to anticipate and mitigate the risk of intraoperative hypotension.

Managing intraoperative hypotension requires a multifaceted approach that encompasses various strategies. These strategies include thorough preoperative evaluation to identify and address risk factors, continuous monitoring of blood pressure throughout surgery, optimization of fluid status, utilization of balanced anesthesia techniques, and the establishment of individualized blood pressure targets for patients. By adopting a comprehensive and tailored approach to managing intraoperative hypotension, healthcare providers can minimize the occurrence of hypotensive episodes and improve patient outcomes following surgery.
