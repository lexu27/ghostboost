The Coptic Christians in Egypt endure pervasive persecution and discrimination across various facets of their lives. Socially and culturally marginalized, they encounter obstacles in securing employment, accessing education, and utilizing public services. Their places of worship are frequent targets of attacks, instilling fear and constraining their ability to participate openly in society. Consequently, Copts live in perpetual apprehension, often resorting to self-censorship and facing limited economic prospects. This persecution not only impacts Coptic Christians but also influences how the global community perceives human rights and democratic values. It is imperative to address the plight of Coptic Christians to combat religious extremism and foster religious tolerance on a global scale. Safeguarding religious minorities is fundamental for nurturing a free and inclusive world. Recognizing the importance of protecting these vulnerable groups allows societies to progress towards a more cohesive and tolerant world, promoting harmony and inclusivity for all.
