Sex and gender are intricate aspects of society, shaped by cultural norms and beliefs, and play a significant role in determining the level of gender empowerment within a community. The Dayak community in Borneo is a notable example of a group that embraces fluid gender roles, promoting equality and autonomy among its members. In contrast, Western societies, with their deep-rooted traditional gender norms, continue to grapple with gender inequalities. These disparities highlight how societal values can profoundly influence our perceptions of sex and gender.

One concerning issue prevalent in Western societies is victim-blaming in cases of sexual violence, which poses a significant obstacle for survivors seeking justice and support. In stark contrast, the Dayak community views sexual violence as a violation of fundamental values, leading to a collective condemnation of such acts and unwavering support for survivors within their community. This exemplifies how different cultural perspectives can shape responses to sexual violence, with some communities, like the Maori people, prioritizing restorative justice approaches over punitive measures.

It is imperative to recognize the impact of societal values on shaping attitudes towards sex, gender, and sexual violence. By challenging harmful stereotypes and advocating for gender empowerment, we can work towards creating a more equitable and supportive environment for all individuals. Addressing sexual violence requires a multifaceted approach that considers the influence of culture, challenges damaging norms, and fosters a climate of empathy and understanding for survivors. Ultimately, acknowledging and understanding these nuances is essential for promoting gender equality, empowering individuals, and combating sexual violence effectively.
