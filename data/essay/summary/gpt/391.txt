Proper follow-up care plays a vital role in patient recovery and overall health outcomes. However, impoverished patients often encounter obstacles that prevent them from attending follow-up visits. In the essay focusing on project management design and leadership styles at East Orange General Hospital, the aim is to tackle the issue of impoverished patients skipping follow-up appointments.

Project management design is crucial in addressing this challenge. The initial steps involve defining the problem at hand, setting clear and achievable goals, and developing a comprehensive action plan through collaboration among the healthcare team. By following these steps, healthcare providers can streamline processes and enhance the efficiency of patient care delivery.

Effective leadership styles are also highlighted in the essay as key components in this initiative. Transformational and participative leadership styles are emphasized for their ability to motivate team members, foster a sense of ownership and responsibility, and create a collaborative environment within the healthcare setting. These leadership styles play a significant role in driving positive change and improving patient outcomes.

Moreover, strategies for behavior change are essential in encouraging impoverished patients to attend follow-up appointments. These strategies include providing financial assistance to alleviate economic burdens, enhancing communication channels to ensure patients understand the importance of follow-up care, coordinating transportation services for easier access to healthcare facilities, cultivating strong patient-provider relationships built on trust and empathy, and empowering community health workers to serve as liaisons between patients and the healthcare system.

In conclusion, a holistic approach that combines effective project management, appropriate leadership styles, and tailored behavior change strategies is proposed to enhance patient outcomes at East Orange General Hospital. By implementing these approaches, the healthcare team can better support impoverished patients in overcoming barriers to follow-up care and ultimately improve the overall quality of healthcare services provided at the hospital.
