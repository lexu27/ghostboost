The United States places a high value on the protection of citizens' rights, with foundational documents like the Alabama State constitution and the American Bill of Rights serving as guardians of fundamental freedoms, notably freedom of speech. The Alabama State constitution ensures freedom of speech, granting individuals the liberty to express their thoughts without the fear of censorship, although it lacks specific limitations on this right. On the other hand, the American Bill of Rights, particularly the First Amendment, establishes a robust framework for safeguarding freedom of speech, encompassing freedom of expression, press, assembly, and petition, while also imposing restrictions on speech such as obscenity and incitement to violence.

In addition to freedom of speech, combating discrimination is a key focus in the United States, as seen through the Fourteenth Amendment and the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA). The Fourteenth Amendment guarantees equal protection under the law and due process for all citizens, challenging discriminatory practices and advocating for equality among all groups, particularly marginalized communities. Conversely, the ERA specifically targets gender discrimination, seeking to embed gender equality into the Constitution to eliminate any ambiguity regarding the unconstitutionality of sex-based discrimination.

While the Fourteenth Amendment has been interpreted to encompass gender protections, the ERA offers a clear and explicit assurance of gender equality, thereby avoiding legal uncertainties. By upholding freedom of speech and addressing discrimination through these constitutional provisions, the United States ensures the protection of rights and liberties for its citizens. These safeguards play a pivotal role in maintaining a just and equitable society where individuals can freely express themselves and live without the fear of discrimination, thereby upholding the foundational values of the nation.
