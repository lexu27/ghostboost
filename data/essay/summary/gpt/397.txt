The Victorian era, spanning from 1837 to 1901, stands out for its strict moral values, adherence to societal norms, and a rich literary tradition. This period in history was characterized by a sense of propriety, emphasizing values such as self-discipline, modesty, and the importance of marriage for social stability. Literature from the Victorian era often delved into moral dilemmas and depicted the societal pressures faced by characters, reflecting the values and expectations of the time.

In stark contrast, modern America embodies individualism, with a more relaxed approach to societal norms and a notable increase in crime rates. The shift towards personal freedom and acceptance of diverse lifestyles has led to the emergence of non-traditional family structures. This evolution in societal values has been mirrored in modern American literature, which explores themes such as individualism, racism, and the impact of consumerism on moral values.

The differences between the Victorian era and modern America have had a profound influence on literature. While Victorian literature grappled with moral conflicts and societal expectations, contemporary American literature reflects the themes of individuality, social justice issues, and the changing landscape of values in society. Crime, a recurring theme in both eras, has been perceived differently, with Victorian justice focusing on punishment and retribution, while modern American justice aims for rehabilitation and addressing root causes.

The contrast between these two periods not only highlights the evolution of societal norms and values but also underscores the dynamic nature of literature as a reflection of the changing world. From the emphasis on moral values and societal conformity in the Victorian era to the exploration of individualism and diversity in modern America, literature continues to evolve, capturing the essence of the times in which it is written. The thematic differences and societal reflections in literature from these two distinct eras serve as a testament to the ever-changing landscape of human values and beliefs.
