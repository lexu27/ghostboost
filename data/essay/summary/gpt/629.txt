Artistic styles such as Art Deco and Depression art emerged during the early 20th century, each conveying distinct characteristics and societal messages. Art Deco, known for its sleek lines, geometric shapes, and vibrant colors, symbolized progress and modernity. It celebrated the advancements of the modern age through opulence and extravagance, often appealing to the upper class with its representation of wealth, luxury, and status.

In contrast, Depression art depicted the somber realities of the Great Depression, reflecting gloom and desolation with its simple and poignant portrayal of poverty. This form of art aimed to shed light on the struggles of everyday people, emphasizing the need for social change and empathy towards marginalized communities. By capturing the hardships faced by many during that era, Depression art sought to evoke a sense of awareness and compassion.

The contrasting styles of Art Deco and Depression art not only showcase the artistic diversity of the time but also reflect the different moods and concerns prevalent in society. While Art Deco exuded a sense of optimism and modernity, Depression art delved into the harsh realities and challenges faced by individuals during a period of economic turmoil. These artistic movements serve as poignant reflections of society's hopes and struggles amidst significant changes and unrest, offering a glimpse into the complexities of the early 20th century.
