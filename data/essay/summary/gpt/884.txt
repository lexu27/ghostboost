In today's multicultural classrooms, it is vital for teachers to create an environment that supports active participation and language development among dual-language learners (DLLs). Group activities play a crucial role in fostering collaboration and enhancing language skills not only for DLLs but also for their peers. By engaging in hands-on activities such as role-play scenarios, DLLs can practice using language in authentic and meaningful ways, preparing them for real-life interactions.

A student-centered approach is highly effective in shifting the focus from teachers to students, encouraging language practice through meaningful discussions and interactions. Visual aids and manipulatives serve as valuable tools in supporting language comprehension and application for DLLs, making learning more interactive and engaging for all students.

Teachers play a central role in fostering language development and engagement among DLLs by implementing a variety of strategies tailored to meet the diverse needs of their students. By incorporating group activities, hands-on experiences, student-centered approaches, and visual aids into their teaching practices, educators can create an inclusive classroom environment where all students feel empowered and supported.

These strategies not only empower DLLs to actively participate in classroom activities but also help enhance their language skills and cultivate a love for learning. By providing a supportive and inclusive learning environment, teachers can make a significant impact on the language development and overall academic success of dual-language learners.
