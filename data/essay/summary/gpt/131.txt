In the realm of nursing practice, two prominent change theories often utilized are Lewin's change theory and Roger's five-step theory. These theories serve as valuable frameworks for understanding and executing change within healthcare settings. Lewin's theory revolves around three key stages: unfreezing, moving, and refreezing, emphasizing the significance of creating a supportive environment and involving stakeholders in the change process. On the other hand, Roger's theory, also known as the Diffusion of Innovation theory, delineates five stages of change adoption within a social system, acknowledging the complexity of change implementation and the need for tailored communication strategies to effectively reach diverse audiences.

While Lewin's theory is praised for its practical and straightforward approach, some critics argue that it may oversimplify the intricate process of change. Conversely, Roger's theory is lauded for recognizing the multifaceted nature of change and adapting communication methods to suit different groups. In scenarios such as a nursing capstone project with limited time and resources, Lewin's theory might be more suitable due to its clear steps and emphasis on collaboration among stakeholders.

Both Lewin's and Roger's theories contribute valuable insights into the realm of healthcare change management. The decision to employ either theory hinges on the specific context and resources available in a given situation. Notably, Lewin's theory's alignment with patient-centered care, a cornerstone of nursing practice, underscores its relevance and applicability in healthcare settings. Ultimately, both theories offer nurse practitioners and healthcare professionals robust frameworks to navigate change processes effectively, catering to the dynamic and evolving nature of healthcare delivery.
