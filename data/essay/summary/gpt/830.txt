The power of word choice and stylistic devices in literature cannot be overstated as they play a pivotal role in shaping the tone and impact of literary works. This is particularly evident in renowned pieces such as Shakespeare's "To be or not to be" soliloquy from Hamlet and F. Scott Fitzgerald's vivid descriptions in The Great Gatsby. 

Shakespeare masterfully captures Hamlet's existential crisis through the careful selection of words and poignant rhetorical questions in his soliloquy. The profound introspection and despair emanating from Hamlet are palpable, drawing readers into his tumultuous inner world.

In contrast, Fitzgerald's descriptive language in The Great Gatsby paints a vivid picture of Gatsby's extravagant parties, using words like "riotous" and "lavish" alongside striking similes. The repetition of key phrases further underscores the excessive nature of Gatsby's lifestyle, contributing to the overall tone of indulgence and decadence that permeates the novel.

Similarly, Maya Angelou's poem "Still I Rise" demonstrates the power of empowering words, repetition, and metaphors in conveying resilience and defiance. Angelou's use of metaphors, such as likening herself to "air" and "moons," enhances the reader's perception of her unwavering strength and determination in the face of adversity.

Collectively, Shakespeare's soliloquy, Fitzgerald's descriptions, and Angelou's poem exemplify how word choice and stylistic devices influence the tone and message of literary works. Each piece showcases a distinct tone - profound introspection and despair in Shakespeare's soliloquy, indulgence and decadence in Fitzgerald's descriptions, and resilience, strength, and triumph in Angelou's poem - highlighting the diverse ways in which language can shape our understanding and emotional response to literature.
