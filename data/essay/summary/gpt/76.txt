The American criminal justice system operates within an adversarial framework that is not without its ethical challenges, ultimately impeding the realization of justice. Of particular concern is the presence of bias that favors the accused, bringing to light troubling racial disparities pervasive in the U.S. judicial system. The disparities in sentencing, notably emphasized in the United States Sentencing Commission report, reveal a stark reality where African American defendants consistently face harsher punishments for drug-related offenses compared to their white counterparts who commit similar crimes.

Systemic racism deeply rooted in the judicial system is sustained by a myriad of factors ranging from law enforcement practices to societal prejudices. These injustices necessitate a reevaluation of the entire criminal justice process to rectify racial disparities effectively. Implementing mandatory sentencing guidelines and actively combating racial profiling stand out as crucial steps toward fostering a fairer system that upholds the principles of equity and justice for all.

The very tenets of fairness and equal protection under the law come into question when examining how the adversarial system may inadvertently afford advantages to the affluent and influential, thereby exacerbating existing racial disparities. Moreover, the reliance on discretion within decision-making processes opens the door to potential biases that can significantly skew outcomes along racial lines, perpetuating systemic injustices.

Addressing these ethical concerns is imperative in reshaping the criminal justice landscape to one that is more equitable and just. A concerted effort to reform existing policies and practices is essential to dismantle the structural barriers that perpetuate racial disparities within the system. By prioritizing fairness, impartiality, and accountability, society can work towards a criminal justice system that truly embodies the principles of equality and justice for all individuals, irrespective of their background or social standing.
