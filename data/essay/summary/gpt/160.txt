Euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide have sparked heated debates within the medical community and society at large. An ethical analysis of these practices from a consequentialist perspective delves into the outcomes and their impact on autonomy and rights. Proponents of euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide argue that these practices play a crucial role in alleviating unbearable suffering and upholding individual autonomy.

Advocates for the legalization of euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide believe that such measures could enhance patient autonomy and foster a deeper respect for individual rights. However, opponents voice valid concerns regarding the potential for abuse, inequalities in access to these practices, and the gradual erosion of the sanctity of life. The availability of euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide may inadvertently lead to unintended consequences such as a decline in the quality of palliative care provided to patients.

Moreover, healthcare providers could find themselves grappling with moral distress and ethical dilemmas when confronted with requests for euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide. Implementing regulations and guidelines can help ensure that these practices are carried out ethically and in the best interest of patients. Therefore, a careful consideration of the ethical implications of euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide is imperative, balancing the promotion of individual autonomy with the preservation of the sanctity of life.
