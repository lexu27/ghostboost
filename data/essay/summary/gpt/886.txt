Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive respiratory condition that poses a considerable global burden on individuals, families, and healthcare systems, especially among smokers. Early detection and management of COPD in smokers are paramount for enhancing patient outcomes, improving quality of life, and reducing healthcare costs. Nursing interventions, including education on smoking cessation, proper inhaler use, encouragement of physical activity, and dietary guidance, are crucial in both preventing and treating COPD in smokers.

Timely identification allows for the prompt initiation of interventions to slow down disease progression and relieve symptoms in COPD patients with a smoking history. A comprehensive assessment involving medical history, physical examinations, and spirometry is imperative for diagnosing and managing COPD, taking into account physical, psychosocial, and functional aspects. Nurses play a significant role in educating patients about COPD, equipping them with self-management skills, promoting healthy lifestyle behaviors, and providing emotional and social support.

Early recognition of comorbidities such as cardiovascular diseases is vital for a multidisciplinary approach to COPD management in smokers. By prioritizing early detection, nursing interventions, and comprehensive care, healthcare systems can effectively address the global burden of COPD in smokers. It is essential to emphasize the collaborative efforts of healthcare professionals, especially nurses, in combating COPD and improving the overall well-being of individuals affected by this condition.
