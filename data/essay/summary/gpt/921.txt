Tragedy has a profound impact on individuals, shedding light on their coping mechanisms and their outlook on life. In William Shakespeare's "Hamlet," the titular character deals with his turmoil through contemplation and self-reflection, which ultimately leads to a delay in seeking revenge. However, Hamlet's worldview is tinted with pessimism, hindering his ability to achieve closure and move forward.

On the other hand, Flannery O'Connor's "A Good Man Is Hard to Find" portrays characters responding to tragedy by resorting to denial and manipulation as coping strategies. The grandmother in the narrative clings to societal status and rigid moral codes as a means of survival. It is her encounter with The Misfit that forces her to confront the superficiality of her values, triggering a newfound realization.

Through these works, it becomes evident that tragedy acts as a catalyst for transformation, causing individuals to adopt a fresh perspective on life. Hamlet's deep introspection starkly contrasts with the grandmother's evolving understanding of existence. The different coping mechanisms depicted in these literary pieces underscore how tragedy can prompt growth and change in individuals, unveiling unique pathways to resilience and enlightenment.
