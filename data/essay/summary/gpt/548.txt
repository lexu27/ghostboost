Jean-Jacques Rousseau, a prominent philosopher of the 18th century, introduced a profound concept of self-love, which comprises two distinct manifestations: amour de soi-même and amour-propre. The former, amour de soi-même, represents an innate form of self-love rooted in one's natural inclination towards self-preservation and personal well-being. In contrast, amour-propre is a socially constructed aspect of self-love that is driven by comparisons with others and the need for external validation.

Rousseau posits that amour de soi-même is essential and beneficial, as it encourages individuals to care for themselves and cooperate with others in society. This natural self-love fosters a sense of unity and mutual support among individuals, contributing to the greater good of the community. On the other hand, amour-propre, fueled by ego and social comparisons, often leads to negative traits such as jealousy, arrogance, and unhealthy competition.

Furthermore, Rousseau argues that amour-propre plays a significant role in perpetuating inequalities within society. By promoting a desire for recognition and superiority, amour-propre tends to favor the powerful and create social hierarchies that further divide individuals. This ego-driven form of self-love not only reinforces existing disparities but also hinders social cohesion and cooperation.

The relevance of Rousseau's concepts extends beyond his time, as evidenced by George Orwell's dystopian novel, 1984. In the novel, the Party manipulates citizens' sense of self-worth and self-esteem to exert control and maintain power over the population. This manipulation reflects the detrimental effects of amour-propre when wielded by those in authority to subjugate and oppress individuals.

In conclusion, Rousseau's insights on self-love provide valuable perspectives on societal interactions, inequality, and the dynamics of power within communities. By distinguishing between the natural self-love of amour de soi-même and the socially constructed amour-propre, Rousseau sheds light on the complex interplay between individual identity, social relationships, and the perpetuation of inequalities in society. His teachings serve as a reminder of the importance of fostering genuine self-worth and cooperation over ego-driven competition and division for the betterment of society as a whole.
