The success of the Iceland model in managing the COVID-19 pandemic hinges on its robust testing kits and efficient contact tracing efforts. However, replicating this model in resource-constrained NATO countries may pose challenges due to financial limitations. To enhance outcomes, incorporating digital epidemiological investigation alongside the Iceland model could be beneficial. Smartphone apps for digital tracking, as exemplified by countries like South Korea and Singapore, have proven effective in monitoring and controlling the spread of the virus. Introducing digital tracking can significantly improve contact tracing and containment endeavors within NATO countries, but this requires substantial financial and infrastructure investments. Institutions tasked with managing data must also be equipped with the necessary resources and expertise to handle the vast influx of information. Collaboration between public health bodies and technology firms is vital in maximizing the effectiveness of such strategies. Embracing alternative approaches, such as digital epidemiological investigation, is essential for combating COVID-19 within NATO countries. Prior to adoption, a thorough evaluation of the financial and infrastructure needs is crucial to ensure the successful implementation of digital tracking initiatives. By combining the strengths of the Iceland model with digital tools, NATO countries can bolster their response to the ongoing pandemic and work towards mitigating its impact on public health.
