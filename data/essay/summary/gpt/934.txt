Connie, the protagonist in the story, falls prey to Arnold Friend's manipulative tactics due to her vulnerability stemming from her fragmented family background. Her relationship with her mother, who consistently unfavorably compares her to her sister, breeds insecurities within Connie, leading to a desire for external validation. This emotional void prompts Connie to seek attention and affection beyond her family circle, leaving her susceptible to individuals like Arnold who thrive on manipulation.

Moreover, Connie's distant bond with her father establishes a pattern of searching for emotional connections elsewhere, paving the way for her vulnerability to manipulators. The disarray within her family environment fuels Connie's rebellious spirit and yearning for independence, leaving her open to exploitation. Her constant quest for love and validation outside her home environment renders her an easy target for those looking to manipulate her emotions.

Arnold Friend capitalizes on Connie's yearning for freedom and acceptance, preying on her vulnerability to further his own agenda. Connie's susceptibility to his manipulation is a direct consequence of her family's failure to provide the necessary emotional support and nourishment she requires. The narrative serves as a poignant reminder of how family fragmentation can significantly impact an individual's susceptibility to manipulation, highlighting the intricate link between one's upbringing and their vulnerability to external influences.

In essence, Connie's vulnerability to Arnold Friend's manipulative advances is deeply rooted in her fragmented family dynamics, emphasizing the profound impact of familial relationships on an individual's susceptibility to manipulation. Through Connie's story, we are reminded of the importance of emotional stability and support within the family unit in safeguarding individuals from falling victim to external manipulation and exploitation.
