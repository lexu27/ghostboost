Immanuel Kant's ethical theory, known as Kantian ethics, delves into the realm of deontological ethics, placing a strong emphasis on moral duty and reason in ethical decision-making. At the heart of Kantian ethics lies the concept of the categorical imperative, a universal moral law that is deemed applicable to all rational beings. This principle dictates that actions are considered ethical if they can be universally applied without encountering contradictions, highlighting the importance of intention over consequences in moral judgments. Kant adamantly prioritized duty and reason over subjective influences such as personal desires or emotions, believing that a rational approach could lead to universally acceptable solutions.

While Kant's ethical framework offers a structured and principled guide for moral reasoning, critics have argued that it oversimplifies the complexities of real-life situations. Despite this, Kant remained steadfast in his belief that reason could serve as a reliable compass in navigating moral dilemmas. The categorical imperative acts as a guiding light for individuals, prompting them to evaluate the moral permissibility of their actions through logical reasoning.

Kantian ethics distinguishes itself by stressing the significance of duty and reason over subjective circumstances, providing a distinctive standpoint on ethical decision-making processes. However, challenges emerge when attempting to apply this inflexible ethical framework to practical scenarios, where the rigidity of the theory may encounter obstacles in adapting to the nuances of real-world complexities. Despite these challenges, Kant's enduring belief in the power of reason and moral duty continues to inspire ethical discourse and philosophical reflections on the nature of morality and ethical responsibility.
