Developing a web-based system entails various risks that can potentially impede project success. One prominent risk is the lack of financial resources required for such a significant investment. Mitigating financial risks involves early cost analysis, evaluating expenses for infrastructure, web development, data migration, and maintenance, and seeking external funding or partnerships. It is crucial to address scope creep, which can lead to project delays and increased costs. Involving stakeholders in defining project scope upfront and establishing a change control process can help manage this risk effectively.

Performance risks, such as data security breaches and system reliability issues, demand focused attention. Prioritizing data encryption, access control, security audits, and continuous testing is essential to mitigate these risks. A structured approach that includes comprehensive risk assessment at project initiation, engaging stakeholders in risk identification, ranking risks based on probability and impact, and creating risk management plans is vital for project success.

Risk management plans should clearly outline action steps, responsibilities, and completion dates, with regular reviews and progress updates to ensure the effectiveness of mitigation strategies. Rigorous cost analysis, controlled scope management, robust security measures, and ongoing risk assessment and management are crucial components for the successful development of a web-based university information system. Careful risk identification and mitigation strategies play a key role in overcoming challenges related to project continuation, completion, and system performance. By addressing financial, scope, and performance risks methodically, organizations can enhance the likelihood of successful project outcomes.
