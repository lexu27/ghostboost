Sociology plays a crucial role in elucidating the intricate relationship between race and health disparities. By providing a structured framework, sociology enables a deep exploration of the complexities surrounding these issues. One of the key contributions of sociology is offering a definition of race that goes beyond biological aspects. Instead, it views race as a social construct that is molded by historical and cultural influences. This perspective allows for a closer examination of how societal structures and institutions impact health outcomes.

Moreover, acknowledging race as a social construct is paramount in addressing health disparities, as highlighted by Hummer (1996). Viewing race through a social lens, rather than a biological one, is essential in comprehending the root causes of disparities in health. Sociology also sheds light on the environmental determinants of health, revealing how unequal distribution of resources and differential exposures contribute to racial health gaps.

Kwate (2008) emphasizes the significance of studying racial residential segregation and its effects on health. By drawing attention to the concentration of poverty and the limited access to healthy amenities in segregated communities, sociology uncovers critical factors influencing health outcomes. Additionally, sociology aids in understanding how factors like segregation, poverty, and discrimination intersect to influence health disparities.

Research by scholars like Hummer (1996) and Kwate (2008) underscores the valuable contributions of sociology in unraveling the complexity of race and health disparities. Through their work, sociology provides essential insights into the interplay between race and health outcomes, paving the way for a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms underlying these disparities. Ultimately, sociology serves as a powerful tool in dissecting the multifaceted relationship between race and health, offering valuable perspectives to guide efforts aimed at addressing health inequities.
