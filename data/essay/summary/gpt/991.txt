Dyslexia is a prevalent learning disorder that impacts millions of children worldwide, posing challenges in reading, writing, and speaking. The effects of dyslexia extend to creating obstacles in various academic subjects, stemming from reading difficulties that often lead to frustration and academic setbacks. Not only does dyslexia affect reading skills, but it also hampers writing and spelling abilities, resulting in disorganized, incoherent, and inaccurate assignments.

Beyond academic struggles, dyslexia brings about emotional and social repercussions for affected children, influencing their self-esteem, confidence levels, and overall interest in school. These challenges can significantly impact both academic performance and personal well-being. However, specialized interventions, such as the Orton-Gillingham approach, have shown promising results in enhancing reading skills and overall academic achievement among dyslexic students.

Moreover, assistive technology plays a crucial role in supporting dyslexic individuals in their reading and writing tasks. Features like text-to-speech software can aid students in accessing and comprehending written information more effectively, thereby reducing the barriers posed by dyslexia in educational settings. By leveraging these interventions and tools, dyslexic students can navigate their academic challenges with greater ease and success.

In conclusion, dyslexia presents considerable hurdles in academic performance and self-esteem for affected individuals. Nevertheless, with the implementation of targeted interventions like the Orton-Gillingham approach and the utilization of assistive technology, students with dyslexia can overcome these obstacles and unlock their full potential. It is essential to recognize the impact of dyslexia on educational experiences and provide the necessary support to ensure that all students have equal opportunities to thrive academically and personally.
