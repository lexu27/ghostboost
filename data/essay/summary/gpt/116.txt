In recent years, companies like Etihad Airways have faced backlash for their unethical and irrelevant handling of layoffs. The lack of employee involvement in decision-making processes has been a significant factor contributing to these issues. When employees are engaged in the decision-making process, it fosters open communication, transparency, and allows for the contribution of ideas and suggestions. This level of involvement makes employees feel valued, motivated, and committed to the organization, resulting in better overall outcomes for both the employees and the company.

Research shows that employee engagement positively impacts various aspects such as performance, job security, and motivation. By involving employees in decision-making, companies could have explored alternatives to layoffs and minimized the negative impact on job security. Disregarding corporate social responsibility and engaging in discriminatory practices during layoffs not only damages the company's reputation but also leads to severe negative consequences in the long run.

It is crucial for companies to recognize the value of employee contributions and involve them in decision-making processes. This approach ensures that ethical and relevant strategies are implemented when facing challenges like layoffs. By fostering a culture of employee involvement, organizations can create a more inclusive and supportive environment where employees feel empowered and motivated to contribute positively to the company's success. Ultimately, prioritizing employee engagement in decision-making is not just beneficial for the employees but also for the overall health and sustainability of the business.
