Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder caused by a mutation in the CFTR gene, impacting the lungs and digestive system. This mutation results in the production of thick mucus in the airways and various organs, leading to complications in both the respiratory and gastrointestinal systems. Patients with CF often experience chronic cough as a prominent respiratory symptom along with poor weight gain as a common gastrointestinal symptom.

The treatment of cystic fibrosis necessitates a collaborative effort from a team of healthcare professionals, including pulmonologists, gastroenterologists, and dietitians. Airway clearance techniques such as chest physiotherapy, exercise, and devices like PEP and HFCWO are crucial components of CF management. Moreover, managing nutrition with a high-calorie, high-protein diet and pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy is essential to support optimal functioning of the body in individuals with CF.

Nurses hold a significant role in the care of CF patients by providing direct patient care, offering education about the condition and its management, and coordinating care among different specialties. Their involvement in the treatment process ensures holistic and comprehensive care for individuals living with cystic fibrosis. Understanding the pathophysiology of CF, recognizing clinical symptoms, engaging in an interdisciplinary approach to treatment, and acknowledging the responsibilities of nursing in CF care are fundamental to delivering effective and compassionate care to patients with this complex condition.Ù‘
