John Milton's "Paradise Lost" and William Shakespeare's "Othello" are renowned literary works that delve into the intricate nuances of good and evil through the masterful use of contrast, semantic imagery, and symbols of light and darkness. In "Paradise Lost," Milton artfully employs contrasting imagery to delineate the stark divide between good, often symbolized by light, and evil, embodied by darkness, particularly epitomized through the character of Lucifer. The semantic imagery in "Paradise Lost," such as the symbolic representations of the "tree of knowledge" and "tree of life," serves to further underscore the profound contrast between these opposing forces of good and evil.

Similarly, in Shakespeare's "Othello," contrasting imagery is skillfully utilized to illuminate the complexities of human relationships and the eternal struggle between virtue and vice. Shakespeare refrains from assigning absolute notions of good or evil to specific characters, instead presenting a narrative where moral boundaries are blurred and subjective. The transformation of Othello from a noble general to a tragic figure consumed by vengeance exemplifies the unraveling of inner darkness, challenging conventional moral interpretations.

Both "Paradise Lost" and "Othello" defy simplistic notions of good and evil by intricately crafting characters like Eve and Iago, whose moral complexities transcend traditional judgments. Milton utilizes light and dark imagery to establish moral hierarchies, while Shakespeare's use of dark imagery mirrors the intricate and imperfect nature of human beings.

Ultimately, these works delve deep into the complexities of human nature, unveiling the multifaceted dimensions of moral boundaries and offering a nuanced perspective on the eternal dichotomy between good and evil. Through their exploration of contrasting imagery, semantic symbolism, and intricate character portrayals, Milton and Shakespeare invite readers to ponder the intricacies of morality and the intricate interplay between light and darkness within the human soul.
