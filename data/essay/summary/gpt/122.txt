Euthanasia, a contentious practice that involves intentionally terminating a person's life to relieve their suffering, is a topic that stirs up ethical debates. Various ethical perspectives, such as teleology, deontology, and Emmanuel Lévinas' theory, shed light on the complexities surrounding euthanasia.

Teleology, also known as consequentialism, takes a long-term view and posits that euthanasia is unethical due to potential wider societal impacts and the risk of devaluing human life. On the other hand, deontology argues that euthanasia is fundamentally wrong as it contravenes the duty to uphold life and alleviate pain.

Emmanuel Lévinas' theory accentuates the ethical responsibility individuals have in caring for others and upholding human dignity. This perspective underscores that euthanasia is unethical as it fails to acknowledge the intrinsic worth of each individual and contradicts the duty to provide compassionate care.

Collectively, these ethical theories align in their stance that euthanasia is ethically unsound and violates moral principles. The emphasis on the sanctity of life, the importance of honoring human dignity, and the obligation to show compassion towards others are recurring themes in discussions surrounding euthanasia.

In conclusion, understanding the ethical implications of euthanasia through the lenses of teleology, deontology, and Emmanuel Lévinas' theory is imperative for making well-informed decisions regarding end-of-life care and for upholding the value of human life. These ethical perspectives serve as guiding principles, reminding us of the significance of preserving life, respecting human dignity, and displaying empathy towards those in need.
