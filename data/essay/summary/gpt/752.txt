The retail industry, particularly for major players like Walmart, is significantly shaped by various external factors such as technology, economics, environment, and competition. Walmart strategically invests in technology to improve both customer experience and operational efficiency. Through the integration of e-commerce platforms, data analytics, and artificial intelligence, Walmart aims to stay ahead in the dynamic retail landscape.

Economic conditions play a crucial role in influencing Walmart's marketing strategies. During economic downturns, Walmart emphasizes value for money and cost leadership to meet the changing needs and priorities of consumers. By adapting its approach based on economic fluctuations, Walmart maintains its competitive edge in the market.

Moreover, Walmart is actively addressing environmental concerns by implementing sustainability initiatives. These efforts not only attract environmentally conscious customers but also help Walmart differentiate itself from competitors. By aligning with sustainable practices, Walmart strengthens its brand image and builds a loyal customer base that values environmental responsibility.
