In Franz Kafka's "Metamorphosis," the theme of loneliness in society is vividly portrayed through the metamorphosis of Gregor Samsa into a giant insect. Gregor's transformation symbolizes the alienation and disconnect prevalent in the modern world, reflecting how individuals often feel isolated from their families and communities. The novella not only delves into Gregor's solitude but also explores the emotional distance that exists within the Samsa family despite their physical proximity.

Moreover, Kafka's narrative sheds light on how technological advancements contribute to exacerbating feelings of loneliness by providing only superficial online interactions as substitutes for genuine human connections. Social media platforms such as Instagram and Facebook are cited as culprits in intensifying loneliness and contributing to depression among individuals seeking authentic relationships in a digital age.

The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic further accentuated the theme of loneliness as lockdowns and social distancing measures isolated individuals from their usual social circles. This period underscored the significance of real human connections over reliance on technological tools for maintaining relationships. Kafka's exploration of loneliness in "Metamorphosis" not only resonates with the challenges of his time but also remains pertinent in today's society, where the quest for genuine emotional connections amidst a backdrop of technological distractions continues to be a universal struggle.
