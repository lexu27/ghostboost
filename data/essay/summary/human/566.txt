Slavery in the American colonies emerged as a result of the necessity for labor in European trading endeavors and marine settlements. Enslaved individuals were utilized across various sectors of the economy, including sugar production and the exploration of raw materials. The practices of slavery varied among different regions in America, with Jamestown pioneering the introduction of enslaved Africans. Port cities played a crucial role in facilitating the international slave trade by linking rural and urban slave markets. In Boston, enslaved individuals were coerced into having children for profit, prompting the enforcement of Massachusetts' initial slavery law.

The labor of enslaved people extended to domestic chores, agricultural work, and the production of trade goods. In contrast, indentured servants migrated willingly in search of economic opportunities in colonial America, distinguishing them from enslaved individuals. Indentured servitude not only provided labor but also left a lasting impact on the culture and society of North America. Through these intertwined systems of labor, the foundation of the American colonies was built upon the backs of individuals subjected to different forms of servitude, each shaping the economic landscape and social fabric of the burgeoning nation.
