Understaffing in healthcare settings is a prevalent issue not only in the USA but also in other countries, significantly affecting employees' performance, well-being, and patient outcomes. The exhaustion experienced by nurses due to understaffing contributes to medical errors, leading to adverse effects on patient health and satisfaction. The COVID-19 pandemic further exacerbated the problem of understaffing, posing a significant burden on the healthcare system.

To effectively address understaffing in hospitals, Cox et al. (2014) proposed a five-step process. The first step involves recognizing understaffing as the primary constraint impacting the quality of care provided. Strategies mentioned in step two include increasing nurse assistant hours during peak periods to support nurses in handling critical tasks. Step three emphasizes the importance of full staff cooperation and understanding of the necessary changes to combat understaffing.

Steps four and five of the process focus on evaluating system constraints through surveys and implementing contracts for peak periods to prevent any inertia in addressing understaffing issues. Introducing more nurse assistants on a seasonal basis can help alleviate understaffing, highlighting the significance of collaboration and commitment from all staff members.

Moreover, the model proposed by Cox et al. is not limited to addressing understaffing but can also be utilized to resolve other challenges faced by healthcare facilities. By following this structured approach, healthcare institutions can not only tackle the issue of understaffing but also enhance overall operational efficiency and patient care quality.

In conclusion, understaffing poses significant risks to healthcare systems, impacting both healthcare professionals and patient outcomes. By implementing strategic measures like those proposed by Cox et al., healthcare facilities can effectively address and mitigate the effects of understaffing, leading to improved staff well-being, patient satisfaction, and overall quality of care provided.
