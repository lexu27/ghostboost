The Ebola virus, a highly contagious and deadly disease, has inflicted significant harm on communities worldwide, marked by high fatality rates and severe consequences. Symptoms of Ebola encompass fever, body aches, diarrhea, and bleeding, with the mode of transmission primarily through body fluids and contact with infected individuals. This virus's origin can be traced back to the Ebola River in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where the consumption of infected animals played a crucial role in its initial spread.

The global outbreak of Ebola was exacerbated by various factors, including a lack of preparedness, low public health literacy, and entrenched cultural practices. These challenges led to widespread ramifications such as economic downturns, social stigmas, and immense strain on healthcare systems within affected regions. In response to this crisis, interventions like the Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) system and initiatives focusing on public health literacy were proposed as critical measures to prevent future outbreaks and mitigate the virus's impact.

To safeguard against the re-emergence of Ebola, recommendations have been put forth, emphasizing the need to promote better health practices, discourage the consumption of game meat from potentially infected animals, and invest in adequate personal protective equipment for healthcare workers and the general population. The road to recovery from the devastation caused by Ebola demands sustained long-term efforts and unwavering support for affected communities to rebuild their lives and healthcare infrastructure. By instituting these measures and mechanisms, it is possible to enhance preparedness, bolster health literacy, and fortify resilience against future outbreaks of Ebola and other similar infectious diseases.
