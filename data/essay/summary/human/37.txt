Amazon, a prominent company in the US known for its efficient deliveries and competitive prices, has recently come under scrutiny for its treatment of workers. This newfound attention stems from issues such as job dissatisfaction and high turnover rates among employees. To address these challenges, traditional motivation methods are being recommended to improve worker retention.

The primary concern highlighted is the negative impact of poor motivation techniques on employee turnover rates. With the rise of e-commerce competition, Amazon is facing increased pressure to reduce costs while still maintaining a motivated workforce. In response, it is suggested that the company implement conservative motivation frameworks as a solution.

This proposed solution involves a systematic approach to addressing employee motivation issues. It includes strategies such as providing regular pay raises, enhancing bonuses, and adjusting timing for employees. By adopting these measures, Amazon aims to boost employee morale, reduce turnover rates, and create a more positive work environment for its staff. Ultimately, by prioritizing the well-being and job satisfaction of its workers, Amazon strives to uphold its reputation as a leading company in the industry.
