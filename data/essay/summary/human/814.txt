Torts are legal wrongs that result in harm or loss to someone, giving the injured party the right to claim damages. In Tom's case, he encountered three different torts: being struck by a baseball, suffering theft of his belongings, and experiencing food poisoning. The liability for each incident varies depending on the circumstances.

Regarding the baseball incident, if there was no disclaimer from the stadium regarding such accidents, they could be held responsible for Tom's injury. However, the theft of Tom's possessions falls under the thief's liability and not the stadium's responsibility.

In the case of food poisoning, if Tom can provide evidence that it caused him to miss two weeks of work, the stadium might be accountable for his damages. On the other hand, the stadium cannot be held liable for the concussion Tom sustained.

When purchasing items directly from the stadium, like a beer and a hot dog, any resulting accidents or illnesses would make the stadium accountable. Tom's transactions with the stadium are legally binding, ensuring that the stadium remains responsible for any problems arising from his purchases.
