The oil heating system in place employs a heater and pump that operate on electricity from a generator, eliminating the need for an auxiliary boiler when inactive. This system works to uphold a steady temperature for the oil within the service tank. Typically, an auxiliary boiler functions by burning fuel oil to produce steam, which then warms a coil responsible for maintaining the oil's temperature. However, in this setup, the heater plays a crucial role in heating the oil within the tank to prevent any significant temperature declines. Additionally, the pump facilitates the circulation of the oil through the heater and back into the tank, ensuring that the oil's temperature remains consistent throughout the system.
