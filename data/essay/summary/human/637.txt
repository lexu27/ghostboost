Wisława Szymborska's poems, "The End and the Beginning" and "Hitler’s First Photograph," delve into profound thematic elements of time, war, and the invisible nature of evil. These works by Szymborska intricately weave together the complexities of historical patterns post-war and the unpredictable nature of future events. 

In "The End and the Beginning," the aftermath of war takes center stage, portraying the arduous process of rebuilding and the lasting impact on subsequent generations inheriting the legacy of conflict. The poem masterfully captures the cyclical nature of war, the waning media attention in the post-war era, and culminates with poignant themes of innocence and new beginnings.

On the other hand, "Hitler’s First Photograph" offers a stark contrast by depicting a young Hitler in a state of innocence, juxtaposed with the foreboding future of becoming a dictator and perpetrating genocide. This poem challenges the reader by contemplating the alternate paths Hitler's life could have taken, emphasizing the notion that evil is not inherent from birth.

Through vivid imagery of Hitler as a regular child in family photo albums, crying during a photoshoot, these poems emphasize the normalcy and humanity present before the descent into darkness. Szymborska skillfully navigates the complexities of time, war, innocence, and the transformation of individuals amidst the backdrop of significant historical events.

Both "The End and the Beginning" and "Hitler’s First Photograph" by Wisława Szymborska serve as poignant reflections on the intricacies of human nature, the impact of war on society, and the delicate balance between past, present, and future. These works invite readers to contemplate the nuanced layers of history, morality, and the enduring legacy of individuals entangled in the web of time and fate.
