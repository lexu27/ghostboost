The Haitian Revolution stands as a poignant example of how armed and organized rebellion was the most potent form of resistance employed by slaves. This historic event showcased the power of unity and strategic action in challenging oppressive systems. On the other hand, while sabotage tactics such as breaking tools, feigning illnesses, and slowing work processes were common among slaves, they were often ineffective in bringing about substantial change.

The act of theft, especially of food, was another method through which slaves resisted their dehumanizing conditions. Justified by their status as mere property of their masters, theft represented a means of survival and a form of defiance against the unjust system that sought to keep them in bondage. 

In contrast, fleeing or attempting to escape, while a direct form of resistance, was fraught with risks and often resulted in severe consequences for the slaves involved. Despite being predominantly pursued by men, escape attempts had limited impact on the overall resistance movement, as they did not address the root causes of slavery nor significantly undermine the institution.

The Haitian Revolution not only marked a significant milestone in the fight against slavery but also served as a powerful symbol of resistance in colonial America. By challenging the notion of perpetual ownership of human beings, the success of the revolution reverberated across continents, reminding slave owners that their control over individuals was not absolute. The rebellion in Haiti stood as a formidable reminder that the spirit of defiance and the desire for freedom could not be extinguished, inspiring future generations in the ongoing struggle for liberation.
