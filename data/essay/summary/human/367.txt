Iran, situated in the Middle East, stands as a theocratic republic with a populace representing a mix of cultures and beliefs, contributing to a deeply fragmented society. The country's participation in global terrorism is greatly influenced by its theocratic regime and adherence to Islamic principles. Two fundamental pillars of the Islamic doctrine, namely jihad and the propagation of the Muslim faith, are central to Iran's endorsement of terrorist activities worldwide.

Following the establishment of the Islamic Republic of Iran in 1979 under the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini, the nation underwent a significant transformation towards Islamic ideals. This shift marked a pivotal moment in Iran's history, shaping its foreign policy that is notably characterized by anti-US and anti-Israel actions, resulting in strained relationships with Western powers. Iran's unwavering support for terrorist organizations like Hamas, Palestine Islamic Jihad, and Lebanese Hezbollah has significantly contributed to the instability plaguing the Middle East region.

At the forefront of Iran's support for terrorism is the Qods Force, which offers military aid encompassing espionage and assassination tactics in tumultuous regions. Not confined to the Middle East, Iran's involvement in international terrorism extends beyond its borders, with documented links to notorious events such as the 9/11 attacks and groups like Al Qaeda. The government's Islamic regime plays a pivotal role in fostering an environment conducive to supporting terrorism, fueling conflicts, revolutions, and challenging the global order.

In conclusion, Iran's complex societal dynamics, underpinned by a theocratic government and Islamic principles, have significantly influenced its engagement in global terrorism. The nation's alignment with extremist groups, coupled with its anti-Western foreign policy, has not only destabilized the Middle East but has also had far-reaching implications on the international stage, sparking wars, revolutions, and posing a threat to global stability and security.
