Social isolation is a significant factor that can lead to behavioral and emotional changes in both humans and animals. In a study conducted by Cho et al. (2017), the impact of treadmill exercise on depression in socially isolated rat pups was explored. The research included various groups of rat pups: socially isolated, control, exercise, and socially isolated with exercise. The treadmill exercise sessions took place daily from day 21 to 34 for the rat pups, with forced swimming tests utilized to evaluate the levels of depression in the subjects.

To assess different factors, methods such as immunofluorescence and western blot analysis were employed in the study. The results revealed that treadmill exercise led to a decrease in resting time and an increase in mobility among the socially isolated rat pups. This outcome suggested that exercise could play a role in reducing the impact of social isolation on stress symptoms. Furthermore, the study concluded that treadmill exercise promoted neuronal generation, which helped alleviate stress caused by social isolation.

The research highlighted the positive impact of physical activity on cell generation, particularly in the hippocampal dentate gyrus, which is crucial in influencing depressive states positively. It was found that hippocampal neurogenesis is closely associated with the effects of antidepressants, underscoring the importance of engaging in physical activity to combat depression effectively.

In conclusion, the study by Cho et al. demonstrated that treadmill exercise could be beneficial in mitigating the negative effects of social isolation on mental health. By promoting neuronal generation and impacting areas of the brain linked to depression, physical activity emerges as a valuable strategy in managing and potentially preventing depressive symptoms arising from social isolation.
