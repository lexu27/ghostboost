Religion has always been a sensitive topic in numerous countries, often leading to violations of human rights. In North Korea, an oppressive political regime severely restricts civil rights and freedom of faith. While North Korea does not officially prohibit religions, it actively persecutes most beliefs, with Christians bearing the brunt of the oppression, facing imprisonment and disappearance. According to the Open Doors 2020 World Watch List, North Korea is considered the most dangerous country for Christians to reside in, highlighting the harsh reality faced by believers in the nation. Despite the blatant violations occurring within its borders, other countries shy away from intervening in North Korea's internal affairs due to political disparities and the looming threat of war. The North Korean government's implementation of inhumane laws and policies, supported by its formidable military power, acts as a deterrent against external intervention. By prosecuting Christians, North Korea aims to curb the spread of freedom and safeguard its national values and integrity, further perpetuating the cycle of repression within the country.
