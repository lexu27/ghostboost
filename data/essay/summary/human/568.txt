In modern scientific knowledge, social reality construction holds a significant place, reflecting the intricate relationship between society and technology. Science not only strives to expand knowledge but also endeavors to apply this knowledge for the betterment of humanity and the environment. Technological approaches and technical procedures shape social reality by influencing how individuals perceive and interact with the world around them.

The structure of social reality encompasses not only creating a shared public image but also utilizing technology to transform the world itself. Through globalization, social reality construction contributes to the emergence of a New World Order, emphasizing the interconnectedness of societies on a global scale. Human activity, encompassing both material and spiritual creations, serves as a fundamental force in shaping social reality, underscoring the dynamic nature of societal constructs.

Social construction seeks to establish universal models where individuals and groups actively participate in shaping their perceived reality. This involvement extends to personal identity, as individuals may adjust their self-image to align with societal expectations, as evident in scenarios like job applications. Social interaction further reinforces social reality construction, emphasizing the mutual influence that occurs among individuals within diverse social groups.

Within these social groups, individuals assume multiple situational roles concurrently, each serving distinct social purposes and objectives. This multifaceted engagement demonstrates how individuals navigate and contribute to the complex tapestry of social reality, highlighting the adaptive and interactive nature of human society.
