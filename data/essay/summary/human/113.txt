Society plays a crucial role in shaping the development of states by influencing group communication and fostering shared values among individuals. This influence extends to how civic engagement impacts public attitudes, lifestyles, and politics within communities, as highlighted in Putnam's essay "Bowling Alone." Putnam brings attention to the diminishing social interactions in the USA and the repercussions that follow. Americans are increasingly moving towards isolation and detachment, moving away from traditional forms of civic participation. This shift is reflected in the replacement of traditional clubs with mass membership organizations that often lack in promoting civic involvement effectively.

Putnam expresses legitimate concerns about the growing disconnect and disengagement among members of communities, emphasizing that this trend towards isolation could ultimately lead to the collapse of civic life in the long term. The risk of the USA losing its strong sense of community relations is significant if the current trends persist. It is essential for individuals and policymakers to acknowledge these trends and work towards revitalizing community engagement to prevent the erosion of civic life and its associated benefits. By fostering a culture of active participation and community involvement, societies can mitigate the risks posed by increasing social disconnection and ensure the preservation of vibrant and connected communities for future generations.
