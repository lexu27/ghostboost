The history of the United States is marred by deep-rooted discrimination and inequality towards African Americans, persisting even after the abolition of slavery. Subconscious biases continue to permeate American society, influencing organizational settings, social systems, and individual behaviors. Recent riots in response to police violence have catalyzed a shift in the national dialogue surrounding institutional racism in America. Black parents and advocacy groups are at the forefront of the fight against racial discrimination and violence, striving for a more just society. 

Advocating for systematic equality entails a comprehensive approach that addresses the financial, institutional, and social structures that perpetuate the marginalization of Black individuals. Participation in movements like Black Lives Matter is deemed essential in the ongoing battle against racist violence and systemic discrimination. Speaking out against prejudice and standing in solidarity with fellow Black parents are critical steps in combatting racism at its core.

Parents of color have been actively working to dismantle racial inequalities within educational settings and have lent their support to community-driven initiatives aimed at fostering inclusivity and equity. Recent tragic events, such as the deaths of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Rayshard Brooks, and Breonna Taylor, have galvanized widespread calls for systemic reforms within law enforcement and the justice system. The relentless efforts of Black parents have significantly contributed to the challenging of discriminatory practices and the reform of institutional frameworks, highlighting the power of grassroots activism in effecting meaningful change.
