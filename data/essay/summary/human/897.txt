Social behavior is a multifaceted concept encompassing the behavioral patterns exhibited within a society during a particular period. These behaviors, whether part of organized movements or not, often lack a specific structure and are influenced by a myriad of factors among participants. It is crucial for the success and longevity of social movements to have external or internal forces, such as political support or financial resources, driving their organization to prevent premature dissolution.

The emergence of the Internet and social media platforms has revolutionized the landscape of social movements, altering how they are instigated, coordinated, and eventually disbanded. Social movements today are diverse and heavily impacted by the pervasive influence of social media, often catalyzed by global events or the spread of rumors within online communities. Even false rumors, as exemplified by the Sony and Apple case in 2010, can wield significant influence over social behavior, underscoring the power of misinformation in shaping societal dynamics.

Furthermore, social media has streamlined the process of creating and dismantling social movements by facilitating rapid dissemination of information among a vast online audience. News of events spreads swiftly through social media posts, online news outlets, and blogs, leading to the instantaneous formation and repercussions of social movements in contemporary society. The interconnected nature of social media platforms has transformed the way individuals connect, organize, and mobilize for social change, illustrating the profound impact of online communication on the evolution of social behavior and collective action in the digital age.
