In the discourse on the modernization of traditional societies, the empirical research conducted in various Middle Eastern nations takes center stage. Lerner postulates that the trajectory of all societies leans towards modernization, a progression significantly influenced by Western ideals. This Western model of modernization is perceived as a universal concept, transcending geographical boundaries beyond the confines of the Western world.

Crucial catalysts propelling this modernization journey include factors such as population mobility, literacy rates, and the pervasive influence of mass media. Nevertheless, ethnocentrism emerges as a formidable obstacle hindering the seamless transition towards modernity in traditional societies.

Criticism is directed at the oversimplified and unidimensional perspective of modernization theory that prevailed in the aftermath of World War II. Lerner's paradigm, while insightful in many aspects, falls short in elucidating the developmental trajectories of nations like China, Russia, and Cuba, thereby diminishing its contemporary relevance in the ever-evolving landscape of global modernization dynamics.
