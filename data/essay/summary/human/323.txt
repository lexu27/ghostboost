The integration of computer technologies into modern society has far-reaching impacts that extend beyond the realm of technology itself. One significant area where this influence is increasingly felt is in the recruitment process. Human Resource managers are embracing AI software to streamline candidate selection processes, with the aim of reducing workload and improving efficiency. However, candidates are also adapting to this technological shift by learning to manipulate technology to enhance their chances in the selection process. They strategically incorporate certain words and tactics in their resumes to align with the preferences of these AI systems.

Despite the benefits of technological advancements in recruitment, there are growing concerns regarding the over-reliance on these tools. An excessive dependence on technology can inadvertently lead to discrimination and the exclusion of qualified applicants. Software filters are reported to eliminate as much as 75% of job applicants based on specific criteria, posing challenges for individuals who may lack the necessary technological skills to navigate these systems effectively.

Moreover, the emergence of third-party services that offer paid resume enhancements further intensifies the competitiveness in the job market. While technology has undeniably enhanced productivity and streamlined processes, it also introduces barriers and vulnerabilities that can be exploited for unethical purposes. The article underscores the flaws in the application of technological systems within modern society, shedding light on the intricate dynamics of human-machine interactions and the potential biases that can arise as a result.

In conclusion, while computer technologies have revolutionized various aspects of society, including the recruitment process, it is essential to strike a balance between technological innovation and human decision-making. Recognizing the limitations and implications of over-reliance on technology is crucial in mitigating discrimination and ensuring a fair and inclusive recruitment process for all individuals. Embracing technological advancements while remaining vigilant against inherent biases is imperative to harness the full potential of these tools in a responsible and ethical manner.
