Labor racketeering is a nefarious practice involving the illicit manipulation of unions and authority by individuals for their own gains, often in collusion with organized criminal syndicates. This insidious behavior has deep roots that were established in the early 20th century, evolving into a significant concern for both law enforcement and society at large. Surprisingly, until the late 1970s and early 1980s, there was a noticeable absence of comprehensive governmental initiatives aimed at combatting labor racketeering.

Organized crime syndicates found lucrative opportunities to profit from illegal ventures, such as bootlegging during the prohibition era. Post-prohibition, these criminal groups expanded their operations into various illicit enterprises like drug trafficking, gambling, and prostitution. Seeking to further their control and influence, these gangs targeted labor unions such as the Teamsters and International Longshoremenâ€™s Association, attracted by the access to legitimate enterprises and valuable resources like healthcare and pension funds.

To conceal their illicit dealings, organized crime entities utilized legitimate businesses as fronts to traffic illegal substances, people, and conceal their criminal activities. Extortion, threats towards employers, solicitation of bribes, and engaging in labor racketeering became common tactics employed by these gangs to advance their interests. This historical pattern underscores the perpetual pursuit of organized crime to dominate local businesses and expand their influence through a diverse range of profit-driven activities, with labor racketeering emerging as a prominent facet in their criminal repertoire.
