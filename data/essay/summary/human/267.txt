In her argument, Kendall highlights the influential role of the media in shaping societal perceptions of class. She contends that the media not only constructs but also legitimizes the notion of class distinctions in the United States by perpetuating stereotypes that reinforce existing inequalities. By showcasing the upper class in a positive light and marginalizing the lower class, media representations influence human behavior through subtle yet powerful portrayals. Upper-class individuals are often portrayed as aspirational figures and role models, whereas the lower class is frequently subjected to negative depictions or rendered invisible altogether.

Moreover, Kendall underscores how media discussions predominantly revolve around the interests and issues of the affluent, effectively sidelining the struggles and concerns of the less privileged. Portrayals of the lower class in media often rely on harmful stereotypes, portraying them as lazy, prone to criminal behavior, or struggling with substance abuse. Consequently, the media's failure to adequately address the needs and challenges faced by the poor contributes to a cycle of neglect that further deteriorates their quality of life.

In essence, Kendall's analysis emphasizes the pivotal role of the media in not only reflecting but also perpetuating class-based disparities in society. By shedding light on these biases and distortions, she calls for a more nuanced and inclusive media representation that acknowledges and addresses the complexities of class dynamics in the United States.
