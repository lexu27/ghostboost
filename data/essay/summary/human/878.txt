During the Mughal era, women in conquered lands faced significant challenges, especially concerning slavery and famines under Mughal rule. The impact of Mughal conquests on women highlighted issues of oppression and hardship in those regions. However, amidst these struggles, a ray of hope emerged with the introduction of the bhakti movement by female poet-saints. This movement emphasized devotion and self-expression, providing women with a platform to articulate their spiritual beliefs and aspirations.

Cloth production played a vital role in the lives of women during this period. Weaving became a significant family production, particularly near urban centers with high demand. Women engaged in the intricate art of cloth production, contributing to both economic sustenance and cultural identity within their communities.

Royal women like Empress Nur Jahan wielded influence in the Mughal Empire by educating princes and shaping political decisions. Their intelligence and guidance played a crucial role in the governance of the empire, showcasing the impact and importance of women in positions of power.

Meanwhile, in Europe between the 16th and 18th centuries, religious influences significantly shaped the lives of women. Access to education varied greatly, and women were often caught in the crosshairs of witch crazes, facing persecution based on superstitious beliefs and societal norms.

The 17th century witnessed a shift in female roles, with women primarily focusing on household chores and child-rearing. Despite this, the century also saw the rise of powerful queens challenging the prevailing notion that women were incapable of governing effectively. Figures like Maria Theresa of Austria exemplified competent female leadership, displaying courage, ambition, and a steadfast commitment to education and progress.

In conclusion, the historical narratives of women during the Mughal era and in Europe highlight a complex tapestry of challenges, resilience, and empowerment. From struggles against oppression to moments of triumph and influence, women throughout history have navigated a diverse array of experiences, leaving an indelible mark on the socio-political landscape of their times.
