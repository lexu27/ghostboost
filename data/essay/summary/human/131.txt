Nurses play a pivotal role in the healthcare system, constantly adapting to new approaches in patient care as the healthcare environment evolves. To effectively implement these changes, nursing professionals often turn to change theories as guiding frameworks. There are two prominent change theories in nursing - Lewin's change theory and Roger's five-step theory. 

Lewin's change theory involves a three-step process of unfreezing the existing system, making the necessary changes, and then refreezing the system to solidify the new practices. On the other hand, Roger's model emphasizes assessing staff response and gradually fostering acceptance of change through thorough research and pilot studies. This model is particularly effective for implementing changes in capstone projects that investigate the impact of Evidence-Based Practice (EBP) training on nurses and patient outcomes.

Data from interventions play a crucial role in facilitating changes in nursing practice. By collecting and analyzing data, nurses can make informed decisions and track the effectiveness of the implemented changes. Notably, Roger's model has been successfully utilized by a preceptor to integrate changes in staff scheduling patterns, highlighting its practical application and effectiveness in driving organizational transformation.

In conclusion, embracing change theories like Lewin's and Roger's is essential for nursing professionals to navigate the complexities of modern healthcare and enhance patient care outcomes through evidence-based practices and continuous improvement initiatives.
