Diabetes remains a significant health concern both nationally and locally, with a need to monitor trends to comprehend its higher prevalence within communities. While there has been a decrease in new diabetes cases over the years, the disease continues to affect a considerable number of individuals under the age of twenty. Inadequacies in the prevention and management of diabetes among older adults highlight the necessity for improvement in healthcare strategies.

Various socio-cultural factors play a crucial role in the prevalence of diabetes, especially within Hispanic populations. Elements such as age, smoking, physical inactivity, obesity, and Hispanic backgrounds contribute to the increased risk of diabetes in communities. In county settings, factors like age, elevated hypertension, and Hispanic backgrounds emerge as primary risk factors for residents, emphasizing the need for targeted interventions and awareness campaigns.

The genetic predisposition of Hispanic individuals to diabetes is further influenced by dietary habits that include traditional high-carb foods and limited access to healthcare services. Health insurance disparities, low income levels, and a lack of awareness within the Hispanic community have collectively contributed to the rise in diabetes cases. Addressing the lack of education and knowledge regarding preventive measures for diabetes is crucial in combating this growing health issue and improving overall community health outcomes.
