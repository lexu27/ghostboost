Multinational corporations are bound by international labor laws that prohibit discriminatory practices based on age and disabilities when making employment decisions. However, Etihad Airways found itself in hot water when it violated these regulations by implementing layoffs that targeted specific groups. This action was not only a breach of legal boundaries but also raised ethical concerns surrounding social justice within the organization.

The importance of social justice in such corporations cannot be overstated. The ethical implications of Etihad's actions reverberated through the company, highlighting the need for fair treatment and inclusivity. One key aspect that could have potentially averted this situation was greater employee involvement in decision-making processes. Research shows that when employees are given a voice in organizational decisions, it not only boosts performance but also ensures fair outcomes that consider diverse perspectives.

Moreover, employee involvement goes beyond mere consultation; it is about empowering individuals to contribute meaningfully to the decision-making process. Etihad could have benefited from this approach, as it might have prevented the dissatisfaction and ineffective strategies that ensued from the lack of employee participation in crucial decisions.

Compensation is another critical factor that influences job security and motivation among employees. Etihad's move to compensate its employees for their contributions and work was a step towards acknowledging their value within the organization. However, payment processing decisions should be transparent and fair to maintain employee morale and loyalty.

In conclusion, the case of Etihad Airways serves as a poignant reminder of the significance of social justice and employee involvement in multinational corporations. By upholding international labor laws, fostering a culture of inclusivity, and empowering employees in decision-making processes, organizations can create a more equitable and productive work environment that benefits both the company and its workforce.
