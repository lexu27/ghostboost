The distortion of African culture by Western scholarship has been a long-standing issue, with colonization shaping the perception of African principles. This distortion has led to the appropriation and commodification of African philosophy, stripping it of its intrinsic value. Scholars such as pâ€™Bitek and Marimba have highlighted how Western ideology has reshaped African culture, spirituality, and philosophy without truly grasping their essence. The commodification of African culture and the imposition of European views have not only disrupted African people's self-identification but have also detached African culture from philosophy and spirituality, unlike European culture, which often commodifies life itself. 

In contemporary society, younger generations of Africans, particularly those living in Western countries, tend to view their culture as mere souvenirs rather than an integral part of their daily lives. This detachment is evident among African-Americans, who struggle with feeling disconnected from traditional African society while also grappling with their European identity. The clash between African and European ideologies further exacerbates these feelings, with European perspectives often controlling how African culture is presented, resulting in a significant loss of cultural identity among Africans. 

Originally, African culture was deeply intertwined with philosophy and spirituality, forming a holistic way of life that has since been transformed into a superficial tourist attraction. This transformation has severed the connection between people and their history and nature, perpetuating a cycle of cultural erasure and detachment. As discussions around decolonization and cultural reclamation continue to gain momentum, it is essential to recognize and restore the intrinsic value of African culture, philosophy, and spirituality, reclaiming them from the confines of appropriation and commodification. Only through this process can African societies truly reconnect with their heritage and forge a path towards a more authentic and culturally rich future.
