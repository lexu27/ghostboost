In Jordan Peele's critically acclaimed film "Get Out," the notion of America as a post-racist society is scrutinized through the lens of fear and tension between white and black characters. The movie challenges the facade of ideal political correctness by portraying white individuals who harbor a mix of love and envy towards black people in a disturbing and perilous manner. By satirizing the classic film "Guess Whoâ€™s Coming to Dinner" and pushing the narrative to ridiculous extremes in the Obama era, "Get Out" sheds light on the deep-rooted racial divide that still plagues the United States.

Through everyday encounters and subtle nuances, the film effectively showcases how racism can alienate individuals and breed hostility among communities. One poignant aspect revealed in the movie is the tendency in society to default to whiteness, forcing black characters to go to extraordinary lengths to be acknowledged and valued. This struggle for recognition mirrors the broader societal issue of systemic racism and the constant need for validation faced by marginalized groups.

Moreover, Peele's film draws attention to the way cinema has historically masked capitalist exploitation through depictions of affluent white families and interracial relationships, as seen in films like "Jezebel" and "Gone with the Wind." These portrayals not only romanticize the past but also perpetuate harmful stereotypes and uphold a skewed power dynamic that reinforces racial hierarchy.

In contrast, the movie "Green Book" offers a stark portrayal of the societal obstacles encountered by a black pianist despite his professional success, highlighting the enduring challenges faced by black individuals in a predominantly white world. Similarly, "Black Panther" directed by Ryan Coogler challenges the prevailing whiteness in Hollywood by striving to establish a Black aesthetic in cinema and questioning the mainstream success of films with predominantly black casts.

Overall, these films serve as powerful cultural critiques that delve into the complexities of race relations in America and the film industry. By dissecting themes of race, power, and representation, they invite audiences to question existing norms and narratives, paving the way for more inclusive and diverse storytelling in the cinematic landscape. Through their thought-provoking narratives and bold storytelling choices, these films contribute to a larger conversation on race and representation, pushing boundaries and reshaping the film industry for a more inclusive future.
