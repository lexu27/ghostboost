Guaman Poma, a descendant of Incan noblemen, faced significant injustices under the colonial rule in Peru. His family endured the loss of their lands and titles, with his efforts to reclaim them being consistently thwarted by the colonial authorities. Initially aligning himself with the Spanish, Poma's fortunes took a turn for the worse when he was exiled over false claims of nobility and his public condemnation of the mistreatment of native populations.

In response to the oppression and disparities he witnessed, Guaman Poma undertook the monumental task of creating a 1200-page illustrated document addressed to the Spanish king. This extensive manuscript meticulously detailed the vibrant pre-invasion Andean way of life juxtaposed with the stark realities of post-conquest abuses suffered by the indigenous peoples. Poma vehemently argued against the Spanish justification for claiming the land, contending for a government that genuinely catered to the practical needs of the populace.

Central to Poma's narrative was the challenge to the prevailing belief that European colonization brought civilization to the Incas. He exposed this notion as a mere facade for the violence and exploitation that ensued. Through his work, Poma shed light on the systematic destruction of indigenous cultures and the erosion of freedom caused by the forced assimilation imposed by the colonizers.

Moreover, Poma underscored the glaring contrast between Spanish moral standards and their actual conduct on the ground. He advocated ardently for the principles of self-determination and social accountability, emphasizing the urgency of empowering communities to shape their destinies and fostering a sense of collective responsibility towards one another. Guaman Poma's manuscript stands as a poignant testament to the enduring struggle against oppression and the unwavering pursuit of justice and equality for all.
