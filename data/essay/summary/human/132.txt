The colonization of the Americas from 1450-1600 had far-reaching implications that reverberated across Asia, Africa, and Europe, as detailed in Chapter 12. While the Ottoman and Chinese empires refrained from direct involvement in these colonization endeavors, the effects of Columbus' discovery were profound. Trade routes were reshaped, borders redefined, and lifestyles transformed on a global scale with the expansion to the west solidifying the division between the New and Old Worlds.

In the aftermath of colonization, the control of information emerged as a significant source of political power, shaping the dynamics of post-colonial societies. Chapter 12 also delves into the Ottoman Empire's conquests and setbacks, shedding light on their European aspirations. Furthermore, the Portuguese influence in Africa and Asia is explored within the broader context of global conflicts and power struggles.

Chapter 13 delves into the intricate relationships between the New and Old Worlds, emphasizing the impact of mercantilism and the quest for resources. The repercussions of the Little Ice Age resonate particularly strongly in South America, affecting the Ming dynasty and the Ottoman Empire in various ways. Notably, the influx of New World silver had detrimental consequences on the Chinese economy, fueling unrest and rebellions as detailed in the historical narrative.

Through a comprehensive analysis of these historical events, Chapters 12 and 13 offer valuable insights into the interconnected nature of global history during the period of colonization. From geopolitical transformations to economic repercussions, the consequences of these historical processes continue to shape our world today, underscoring the enduring legacy of the colonial era.
