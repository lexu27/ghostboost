The 20th century marked a significant period of change in America, characterized by socio-cultural and scientific revolutions that reshaped attitudes towards marginalized social groups. Marginalized groups encompass individuals who deviate from societal norms and lack access to social benefits due to factors such as race, gender, sexual orientation, or disability. These disadvantaged groups share a common experience of being deprived of the fundamental conditions necessary for a comfortable existence, often as a result of opposition from mainstream society.

Among the marginalized communities, LGBTQ+ activism has played a pivotal role in advocating for rights, combating discrimination, and striving for inclusion. Despite facing significant challenges and exclusion, the LGBTQ+ movement has made notable progress in recent years, contributing to greater awareness and acceptance within society. Central to this struggle is the concept of self-identity, which serves as a cornerstone for LGBTQ+ individuals in their pursuit of equality and social recognition.

Concurrently, Native American populations have endured centuries of oppression, violence, and systemic injustices, resulting in social vulnerability and perpetuation of cultural stereotypes. The historical stratification within society has marginalized indigenous peoples, relegating them to the lower echelons of social and economic hierarchies and exacerbating existing disparities. Understanding the struggles faced by indigenous populations through the lens of functionalism theory provides insights into the mechanisms of marginalization and the complex challenges they encounter in American society.

Patriarchy, entrenched within societal structures, reinforces social hierarchies that marginalize LGBTQ+ individuals, particularly through heteropatriarchal norms that prioritize and uphold traditional gender roles. This intersectionality of gender and sexual orientation further complicates the experiences of LGBTQ+ individuals within the broader context of social marginalization. By addressing these entrenched systems of oppression and advocating for greater inclusivity and equality, society can work towards dismantling barriers and fostering a more equitable and supportive environment for all marginalized groups.
