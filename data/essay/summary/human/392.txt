Tufts-New England Medical Center (Tufts-NEMC) has a rich history marked by both financial struggles and triumphs. In the 1990s, the organization encountered significant obstacles stemming from financial instability and unsuccessful network alliances. To address these challenges, Tufts-NEMC decided to merge with the Lifespan Corporation. However, this move led to identity dilution and further financial setbacks for the organization. Issues such as underpayment, intensifying competition, and the imperative to maintain quality services and robust research initiatives compounded the difficulties faced by Tufts-NEMC.

Despite these hurdles, the organization remained committed to serving the community, fostering innovation, and adapting to evolving societal needs. Tufts-NEMC pursued transformative approaches like the ADKAR Model to raise awareness about the necessity for change within the organization. Emphasizing the importance of challenging the status quo and outlining a clear vision for change became focal points for driving organizational improvement.

In the realm of leadership development and organizational transformation, instilling a sense of crisis and disequilibrium was deemed crucial. This strategy aimed to shake the existing norms and foster a conducive environment for change initiatives to take root. By embracing a proactive stance towards change, Tufts-NEMC endeavored to navigate through turbulent times and emerge stronger and more resilient.
