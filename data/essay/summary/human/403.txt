Culture within organizations is a multifaceted concept that can be examined through various perspectives, as highlighted by Edgar Shein and Edward Granter. The levels of culture are not one-dimensional but rather exist in different planes and depths. Organizational culture, for instance, can be observed across four distinct levels: super-structural, symbolic, discursive, and cognitive.

External economic and social factors play a significant role in shaping the culture of enterprises. This influence is evident in the artifacts, values, and underlying assumptions prevalent within an organization. For example, Macomb Community College's culture is characterized by its emphasis on concentration, technology, fine arts, and community relations. The college values traits such as order, organization, composure, and commitment among its students, reflecting its core beliefs and priorities.

Moreover, the assumptions at Macomb Community College hint at a preference for students who do not solely conform to superficial popular culture trends. While the emphasis on certain values is commendable, there is a suggestion that the college could benefit from fostering openness in relationships and reducing judgment towards superficial identities. By embracing openness, the college can create a more inclusive environment that values diversity and individuality.

Recommendations for Macomb Community College include acknowledging the importance of openness in building strong social connections. Emphasizing openness can lead to enhanced communication, collaboration, and mutual understanding among students, faculty, and staff. By cultivating a culture that values openness and acceptance, the college can create a more welcoming and supportive community for all individuals involved.

In conclusion, the examination of culture within organizations reveals its multi-layered nature and the impact of external factors on shaping core values and assumptions. Macomb Community College's culture reflects a unique blend of values and priorities, with opportunities for growth in promoting openness and inclusivity. Embracing these recommendations can contribute to a more vibrant and harmonious campus community.
