Sustainable development has become a crucial topic in today's world, shedding light on various issues such as food waste and environmental protection that significantly impact sustainable eating habits. The daily food consumption practices of individuals have been identified as key influencers of environmental impact both in the short and long term. An environmental worldview analysis based on food habits reveals different approaches to managing resources and reducing waste, with a particular focus on stewardship.

When examining eating habits, it is evident that they can reflect different philosophies, including materialism, pantheism concerning nature, and anthropocentrism prioritizing personal needs. Unfortunately, these perspectives often result in a lack of concern for the sources of food and the methods of production, leading to unsustainable practices and wastage.

On the other hand, adopting a stewardship worldview encourages individuals to pay attention to sustainable resource use and actively work towards reducing harm to the environment. By incorporating spiritual practices such as engaging in family cooking, transitioning to a vegetarian diet, and supporting sustainable farmers through purchases, individuals can enhance their relationship with nature and promote sustainability.

It is essential for individuals to align their personal environmental worldview with the principles of stewardship, showing a commitment to minimizing harm to nature while acknowledging the need for continuous improvement in contributing to sustainability efforts. By making conscious choices in daily food consumption and embracing practices that prioritize the well-being of the planet, individuals can play a significant role in fostering a more sustainable future for generations to come.
