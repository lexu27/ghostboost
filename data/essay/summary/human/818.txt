At the heart of the narrative is the protagonist, Ignatius J. Reilly, whose character embodies traits synonymous with antisocial personality disorder. These characteristics, such as self-indulgence, arrogance, and deceitfulness, paint a complex portrait of Ignatius as he navigates through life.

One pivotal relationship explored in the novel is that between Ignatius and his mother, which serves as a microcosm of his abusive and manipulative tendencies, characteristic of individuals with antisocial personality disorder.
