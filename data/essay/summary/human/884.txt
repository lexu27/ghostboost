Effective communication strategies play a vital role in supporting students with specific language-related needs, such as dual-language learners (DLLs), to actively engage in conversations. DLLs exhibit a unique advantage in tasks requiring the navigation between different language sets, showcasing their linguistic flexibility. To further enhance their language skills and participation, educators can integrate activities that necessitate quick language switches and the translation of concepts into various languages. 

Encouraging DLLs to ask and answer questions during reading exercises can be facilitated by reducing the reliance on the teacher's verbal prompts and suggestive questioning in classroom dialogues. By minimizing unnecessary verbal cues and replacing them with non-verbal signals like visual aids and gestures, educators can stimulate DLLs' motivation to interact and articulate their ideas effectively. Monitoring and adjusting questioning patterns can foster a supportive environment where children feel empowered to share their thoughts and engage actively in group discussions.

Moreover, utilizing visual cues and gestures as prompts in place of direct answers can serve as a catalyst for stimulating DLLs to actively participate in conversations and express their thoughts, thereby nurturing their speaking abilities through regular practice. By employing these strategies thoughtfully, educators can create an inclusive and engaging learning environment that supports the language development and communication skills of dual-language learners.
