The aftermath of World War II had a profound impact on Asia and its governance as European colonial powers found themselves weakened, unable to maintain control over their colonies due to resource constraints. Despite the anti-imperialist sentiments prevalent back home, the decolonization process following the war faced hindrances. However, some colonies that had supported their colonial rulers during the war were eventually granted independence as a result.

Countries such as the Philippines, India, Ceylon, and Burma emerged as independent nations post-WWII, marking a significant shift in the geopolitical landscape of Asia. Prior to World War II, Japan harbored ambitions of expanding its influence, initiating its East Asian expansion through the invasion of Manchuria in 1931 and later launching a campaign on China in 1937. By aligning with Germany and Italy within the Axis alliance, Japan further pursued its imperial aspirations.

In response to Japan's aggressive advancements, the United States imposed economic sanctions to curb Japan's aggression, aiming to compel the evacuation of Japanese troops from Manchuria and China. Japan, in turn, sought to challenge US dominance in the Pacific by targeting American and British forces in Asia, hoping to secure vital resources for its expansionist goals.

The 19th century saw Asian states embark on a trajectory of modernization by embracing aspects of Western culture, integrating into the global community, and forging economic alliances with other nations. This period of transformation laid the groundwork for the evolution of Asian societies into the modern nations we recognize today, shaped by the complex interplay of historical events and shifting power dynamics on the world stage.
