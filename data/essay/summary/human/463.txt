Intraoperative hypotension (IOH) poses a significant challenge during surgical procedures, with implications for postoperative complications and mortality rates. Various factors contribute to IOH, including intravascular hypovolemia, vasodilation, low cardiac output, high intrathoracic pressure, and compromised baroreflex regulation. Patients at higher risk of experiencing IOH include those who are older, have a history of hypotensive episodes, undergo emergency surgeries, and are susceptible to tissue ischemia.

IOH is not a benign occurrence, as it has been linked to adverse outcomes such as myocardial injury, acute kidney injury, and harm to other vital organs. The incidence of IOH varies depending on the criteria used, but a notable percentage of surgeries witness mean arterial pressure falling below the critical threshold of 65 mmHg. Anesthetic drugs that trigger vasodilation and venodilation play a significant role in inducing hypovolemia, thereby contributing to decreased blood pressure levels.

One of the challenges in addressing IOH is that patients under sedation may not exhibit obvious signs or symptoms, underscoring the importance of continuous blood pressure monitoring throughout the surgical process. While the causes of IOH are relatively well-understood, there is a call for further research to delineate effective treatments and enhance perioperative care practices aimed at minimizing adverse outcomes and mortality rates associated with IOH.

In conclusion, IOH remains a complex issue in surgical settings, with its multifactorial nature necessitating a comprehensive approach to management. By understanding the risk factors, monitoring patients effectively, and exploring avenues for improved treatment strategies, healthcare professionals can work towards mitigating the impact of IOH on patient outcomes. Research efforts focused on refining perioperative protocols and interventions hold the promise of reducing the incidence of IOH-related complications and enhancing overall surgical safety.
