Sexual orientation has long been a topic of debate, with opinions divided between those who believe it is a choice and others who argue for a biological basis. To investigate the factors influencing people's sexual orientation identification, a project was initiated with a focus on two main variables: "sexort" for sexual orientation and "sexbirth" for sex assigned at birth. These variables are deemed crucial for understanding how the environment can impact sexual orientation.

The central research question raised by the project is whether the environment plays a significant role in shaping individuals' sexual orientation. It emphasizes that sexuality is a fundamental aspect of identity that should be protected and supported by governmental measures. One key aspect explored is how the varying environments experienced by males and females can have a profound influence on their identification with sexual orientation.

Utilizing the GSS database, the study aims to delve into the relationship between sex assigned at birth and sexual orientation. By examining perspectives on the determinants of sexual orientation, the project addresses both biological and environmental influences. It highlights that grasping the influence of the environment on sexual orientation is essential for understanding the complexities of individual identities.

In conclusion, the project underscores the importance of comprehending the impact of the environment on sexual orientation. By exploring the interplay between biological and environmental factors, the study sheds light on the intricate dynamics that shape individuals' identities and their understanding of sexual orientation.
