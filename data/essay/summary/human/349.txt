ACL injuries, particularly tears to the anterior cruciate ligament, are prevalent and can significantly disrupt a patient's mobility and daily life. The ACL, a critical ligament in the knee joint, is prone to tearing or stretching beyond its limits due to various factors. When ACL injuries occur, they often necessitate professional medical intervention and surgical reconstruction using grafts. Among the graft options available for ACL reconstruction, the bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) autograft is the most commonly utilized.

While ACL reconstruction with a BPTB autograft is generally successful, there are potential complications that can arise, albeit typically avoidable with minimal long-term consequences on patient outcomes. However, some patients may experience persistent issues such as anterior knee pain following ACL reconstruction with a BPTB autograft, impacting their ability to engage in physical activities. Researchers have identified risk factors associated with the development of anterior knee pain post-ACL reconstruction and have proposed surgical modifications to mitigate its occurrence.

Recent studies have shed light on the potential drawbacks of using BPTB grafts in ACL reconstruction, indicating a higher likelihood of experiencing anterior knee pain and discomfort when kneeling compared to alternative graft types. These findings have prompted discussions regarding the optimal utilization of BPTB autografts in ACL reconstruction procedures, raising questions about the best approaches to enhance patient outcomes and minimize long-term complications. As healthcare professionals continue to investigate the efficacy and potential limitations of different graft options for ACL reconstruction, the ultimate goal remains ensuring that patients receive the most appropriate treatment to restore knee function and improve their quality of life.
