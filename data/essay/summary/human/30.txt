The impact of COVID-19 lockdowns on adolescent pregnancy and school dropout among secondary school girls in Kenya is substantial. Teenage pregnancy cases in Kenya saw a surge during the nationwide school closure from March 2020 to January 2021. This rise can be attributed to the lack of sexual education and awareness of protection methods among adolescents. The issue is exacerbated by health administrators' limited involvement in addressing pregnancy among school girls, leading to various socio-economic problems. Adolescent pregnancy not only jeopardizes girls' health but also poses risks to their mental and physical well-being due to high stress levels.

To combat this concerning trend, recommendations have been made to introduce population-level interventions that prioritize educating girls in schools about sexual education and contraceptives. It is crucial to inform school girls about the significance of contraceptives to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. Additionally, national projects are required to educate school students and parents about sexual and reproductive health issues comprehensively. 

The effects of COVID-19 on teenage pregnancy extend beyond individual repercussions, impacting the society and economy at large. Hence, urgent measures need to be taken to address this issue effectively and mitigate its negative social and economic implications on both individuals and the country as a whole.
