The COVID-19 pandemic brought about a surge in the development of vaccines to combat the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. In the United States and Europe, various types of vaccines were produced, including Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, AstraZeneca/Oxford, and Johnson & Johnson. The emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus posed a significant challenge to global health systems due to its unique evolutionary characteristics and the lack of preparedness to deal with a new pathogen.

Coronaviruses are well-studied viral particles with RNA as genetic material. The virus exhibits spike-like peplomers on its envelope, allowing for efficient binding to cell receptors. SARS-CoV-2 primarily affects the upper respiratory tract, leading to acute respiratory viral infections. Different variants of COVID-19, such as Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron, have been identified globally. Among these, the Delta and Omicron variants have caused concern due to their increased transmissibility and potential impacts on vaccine efficacy.

The vaccines developed employed innovative technologies to combat the virus. mRNA vaccines, including Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, deliver genetic instructions to cells to produce the spike protein of the virus. This process triggers an immune response that helps in fighting against COVID-19. On the other hand, viral vector vaccines, like Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca/Oxford, use a modified version of a different virus to deliver genetic material from the COVID-19 virus into cells, prompting an immune response.

Studies have indicated variations in the efficacy of different COVID-19 vaccines. Generally, mRNA vaccines have shown higher efficacy compared to viral vector vaccines like Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca/Oxford. The ongoing research in this field aims to delve deeper into the biochemical and technological foundations of COVID-19 vaccines. Specifically, the focus is on mRNA and viral vector technologies utilized in Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, AstraZeneca/Oxford, and Johnson & Johnson vaccines. Through continued research and innovation, the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic progresses with the development of effective vaccines that play a crucial role in curbing the spread of the virus and protecting global health.
