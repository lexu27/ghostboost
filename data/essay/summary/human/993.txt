Chapter 3 delves into the historical development of parole in the United States and its present role within sentencing procedures. Recent research reveals that individuals released without parole oversight exhibit higher rates of recidivism compared to those under parole supervision. To address this issue, there is a call to reintroduce discretionary parole release, supported by empirical data. The authors advocate for the establishment of competent parole boards that adhere to transparent criteria and principles when making release determinations. While the chapter provides a concise overview, it lacks in-depth exploration of vital aspects such as the operational mechanisms of proficient parole boards.

Moving on to Chapter 4, the focus shifts towards parole supervision and its distinction from parole release in contemporary contexts. The narrative highlights the evolution of parolee check-in protocols at parole facilities following the 1980s. The chapter underscores the importance of implementing effective rehabilitation initiatives aimed at curbing reoffending rates while being economically viable. There is a growing consensus calling for increased research efforts and policy attention directed towards enhancing these rehabilitation programs. Furthermore, there is a suggestion for further retrospective analysis to bolster the justification for the efficacy of rehabilitation programs in reducing recidivism rates. By concentrating on both parole release and supervision along with the significance of rehabilitation programs, policymakers and stakeholders can work towards a more effective and sustainable criminal justice system.
