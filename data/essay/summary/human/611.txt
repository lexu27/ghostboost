Car theft poses a significant problem in both the UK and North America, prompting legislators to mandate that car manufacturers bolster mechanical security features. Perpetrators have devised new methods to steal vehicles, with a prevalent tactic involving the theft of keys to gain entry. Through interviews with offenders, including those imprisoned for car theft, valuable insights into key theft techniques have been gleaned. 

The motivations driving car theft range from opportunistic impulses to deliberate hunting, often enabled by car owners' lapses in implementing fundamental security precautions. Some offenders employ brazen tactics such as brandishing weapons or administering substances to subdue resistance during carjacking incidents. Furthermore, manipulation tactics are utilized by certain criminals to coerce owners into surrendering their keys, leveraging deceit or diversionary tactics in the process.

The acquisition of master keys, whether obtained illicitly from dealerships or modified from existing keys, serves as a prevalent method for facilitating car theft, particularly among older vehicle models. Despite ongoing efforts to enhance mechanical security features, offenders persist in targeting car keys as a primary avenue for stealing cars. Consequently, there is a growing consensus that preventative strategies need to pivot towards safeguarding car keys and spares, thus raising the bar for perpetrators attempting to access them.

It is imperative for both individuals and commercial car dealerships to ramp up security measures to thwart criminals from exploiting vulnerabilities. By fortifying measures to protect car keys and augmenting overall security protocols, the ability of offenders to abscond with vehicles illicitly can be significantly curtailed. The collective responsibility to address the multifaceted issue of car theft necessitates a proactive stance that encompasses both legislative mandates and individual diligence in safeguarding vehicles against criminal elements.
