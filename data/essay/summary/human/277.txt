Gender roles have been a prominent focus when examining literature across various historical eras. In the Anglo-Saxon period, gender roles were sharply defined, particularly evident in works like Beowulf. Women in Beowulf were often portrayed in subservient roles, serving as enablers for the male protagonists and propelling the narrative forward. Their characters were overshadowed by prominent male figures such as Hrothgar, Beowulf, Wiglaf, and Unferth, reinforcing traditional gender hierarchies of the time.

One striking example is the unnamed queen of the Swedes in Beowulf, emphasizing her lack of individual identity apart from being the king's wife. This underscores the pervasive notion that women were primarily valued in relation to their male counterparts during that era. The societal norms of the eleventh century dictated that women were expected to primarily nurture and demonstrate qualities of gentleness towards men.

The contrasting portrayals of Queen Modthryth and Queen Hygd in Beowulf serve to highlight the prevailing attitudes towards autonomous versus married women. Queen Modthryth's transformation from a controversial figure to an accepted member of society only upon her marriage exemplifies how women's societal worth was intrinsically tied to their marital status. This transformation underscores the limited agency and autonomy that women held in a predominantly patriarchal society.

In conclusion, the depiction of gender roles in Beowulf sheds light on the rigid expectations and limitations placed on women during the Anglo-Saxon period. Female characters were often relegated to secondary roles, serving as instruments to advance the stories of male protagonists. The treatment of women in Beowulf reflects the broader societal views on gender and marriage prevalent during that epoch, illuminating the challenges and constraints faced by women in historical contexts.
