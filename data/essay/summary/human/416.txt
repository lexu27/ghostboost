Healthcare providers play a crucial role in caring for critical patients, and their mental health significantly impacts the quality of care they provide, especially during challenging times like the ongoing pandemic. Recognizing this, a project has been initiated to evaluate mental health services for healthcare providers working with critical patients in a primary care facility.

The primary aim of this project is to assess and improve the mental well-being of healthcare employees by identifying vulnerable groups in terms of mental health and developing recommendations to prevent adverse outcomes. The focus will be on evaluating issues such as exhaustion, stress, burnout, and other mental health disorders that healthcare workers may experience while on duty.

Various stakeholders are involved in this project, including psychologists, social workers, and nurses, each bringing different perspectives and expertise to address the mental health needs of healthcare providers and critical patients. To effectively evaluate and enhance mental health assistance, the project will address financial, stakeholder, patient, spiritual, facility, and funding requirements.

In addition to addressing the mental health needs of healthcare providers, the project emphasizes the importance of conducting a risk assessment to safeguard the confidentiality of participants' personal information and ensure compliance with legal and regulatory standards.

Recommendations stemming from this project include integrating mental health assessment tools into healthcare units and raising awareness among clinicians about stress and mental health issues. By shedding light on the challenges healthcare employees face regarding their mental well-being, the project aims to offer practical solutions to enhance their overall welfare.

Furthermore, the project's literature review focuses on the mental health of healthcare workers during the pandemic, analyzing stress levels, burnout rates, and potential interventions to support these frontline workers effectively. Through these comprehensive efforts, the project endeavors to advance understanding, support, and care for healthcare employees working with critical patients, ultimately promoting a healthier and more resilient healthcare workforce.
