Law enforcement has a long history of prioritizing the safety, well-being, and protection of citizens from various threats such as civil disorder and crime. Initially, law enforcement relied on the use of force sanctioned by the government to uphold order within society. This practice traces back to early forms of policing where clan members were responsible for enforcing group regulations on unruly individuals.

In these early societies, any act of violence against a member of the community was perceived as an assault on the collective group, highlighting the communal nature of law enforcement at the time. Notably, early law enforcement agencies placed significant emphasis on avoiding coercion, undertaking a diverse range of tasks, and establishing clear boundaries when it came to policing duties.

Peace officers have a critical obligation to uphold the law without engaging in criminal activities themselves. They are required to adhere to legal protocols especially in areas concerning detention procedures and the preservation of evidence. Furthermore, peace officers are mandated to operate within the confines of their authority and must not infringe upon the freedoms of individuals they encounter during their law enforcement duties.

While peace officers are expected to comply with criminal procedures, there may be instances where deviating from these protocols is deemed necessary by law. This flexibility allows police officers to adapt to unique situations and challenges while still operating within the legal framework established to ensure justice and order in society.
