Romanticism, a movement that emerged in the 19th century as a response to neoclassicism and the Enlightenment, placed a strong emphasis on fantasy, emotions, and mental exploration. In both literature and art, Romanticism showcased heroes with daring and rebellious personalities akin to figures like Byron and Prometheus. These protagonists often grappled with internal struggles while facing external conflicts, embodying the Romantic ideals of individualism and emotional depth.

In the realm of painting, Romantic artists delved into the complexities of human nature by rejecting rationalism in favor of dramatic expressions of nature. Through their works, they sought to evoke powerful emotions and convey the sublime through depictions of themes such as night, thunderstorms, and mysticism. The characters portrayed in Romantic paintings mirrored those found in literary works, allowing for an exploration of the darker facets of humanity.

One of the defining characteristics of Romanticism in literature was the perpetual movement of the hero through physical space, symbolizing the turmoil within the protagonist's soul and the ever-changing nature of reality. These heroes often exhibited an egocentric nature and rebelled against the constraints of material reality, resulting in a stark juxtaposition between the idealized world they envisioned and the harshness of actuality.

Examples of Romanticism in literature can be seen through characters like Childe Harold and Pechorin, who embody the struggle between the real world and an idealized existence. Contemporary works, such as "The Perks of Being a Wallflower," also exemplify Romantic elements by following the journey of characters like Charlie, a 16-year-old boy navigating the challenges of adolescence while experiencing personal growth and self-discovery.

In conclusion, Romanticism, with its focus on emotion, individualism, and the exploration of human nature, continues to be a profound and influential movement in both literature and art, resonating through the centuries with its timeless themes and complex characters.
