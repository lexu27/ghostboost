The 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, passed to abolish slavery in the country, stands as a paramount milestone in American history. By ensuring that no U.S. citizen can be enslaved regardless of their characteristics, this abolition of slavery had a profound impact on the nation. It not only restored individual freedom but also played a pivotal role in promoting nationwide democracy. While the immediate effects of the 13th Amendment may not be as apparent in daily life today, its influence persists in how it limits human freedom, especially in cases of involuntary servitude linked to criminal punishment. Unfortunately, the lack of clarity within the amendment has contributed to the disproportionately high rates of imprisonment among racial minorities in the U.S.

In addition, the 15th Amendment, ratified in 1870, furthered the quest for equality by granting every American citizen the right to vote regardless of race. This monumental shift towards inclusivity and the eradication of constitutional racism has been instrumental in securing voting rights for Black Americans. The 15th Amendment has not only addressed racism on a constitutional level but has also impacted individual relationships within society and has the potential to significantly influence the political landscape. With nearly 15% of the U.S. population being Black, their voting rights hold immense power in shaping the political discourse of the country. Through these amendments, America continues its journey towards a more egalitarian and just society, aiming to uphold the principles of freedom, democracy, and equality for all its citizens.
