The preservation of Confederate statues has ignited heated debates, with President Trump advocating for their protection as significant historical symbols. However, mounting evidence suggests that these statues should be removed due to the racial disparities and White supremacy they represent. Erected mainly in the early 20th century during a period marked by discriminatory laws against Black people, these monuments were sponsored by the United Daughters of the Confederacy. Their purpose was deeply entrenched in a strategy to perpetuate White supremacy and reinforce racial inequalities, particularly evident during the civil rights movement.

The connection between these statues and structured racism becomes glaringly apparent when examining the historical context in which they were erected. These monuments were intended to symbolize the protection of Whites by the law, further perpetuating a system of racial dominance. In response to ongoing discrimination against Black citizens, there have been instances of removal or relocation of Confederate monuments across the country.

While there is a growing consensus that statues linked to White supremacy should be removed, there are those who argue that not all monuments should be destroyed. They posit that preserving some statues serves as a reminder of both the positive and negative aspects of history. However, the broader narrative surrounding Confederate statues underscores the need to critically evaluate the messages they convey and the role they play in perpetuating harmful ideologies and racial divides.
