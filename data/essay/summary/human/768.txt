The feminist movement in the United States during the early 20th century marked a significant period of challenging traditional social norms and redefining gender roles, ultimately reshaping the dynamics between men and women. Central to this transformation was the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, a pivotal milestone despite encountering obstacles in some states colored by racial prejudices. The early suffragettes exhibited diverse viewpoints regarding the 19th Amendment, with varying considerations of race and class evident in the stances of figures like Belle Kearney and Adella Hunt Logan. For instance, Jane Addams perceived the amendment as a logical extension of women's domestic responsibilities, contrasting with perspectives like Winslow's, which regarded it as a means to rectify pervasive injustices faced by American women.

Interestingly, the support for the 19th Amendment was not unanimous among women, with some, particularly in Tennessee, opposing it out of fear that its passage would inadvertently grant African Americans voting rights. This dissent underscored the complex interplay of gender, race, and political power within the feminist landscape of the time. Recognizing the need for a more inclusive approach, the feminist movement gradually embraced intersectionality, advocating for women of all races and ethnicities to unify in the fight against systemic oppression. While racial biases persisted within segments of the movement, a broader emphasis on multiculturalism and intersectionality emerged, highlighting a commitment to solidarity and support for all women.

Moreover, the Suffragette movement's convergence with other progressive causes, including anti-segregation efforts and advocacy for working-class rights, amplified its impact as a force for sociopolitical change. This interconnectedness showcased the movement's capacity to drive broader social reforms beyond gender equality alone. Although the movement's inclusivity was not immediate or comprehensive, it laid a crucial foundation for the ongoing liberation of American women, stressing the essential values of inclusivity and compassion within feminist activism. By recognizing the significance of embracing diversity and humanity in feminist discourse, the movement established a framework for advancing women's rights and social justice for generations to come.
