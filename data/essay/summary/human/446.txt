In healthcare settings, nurses play a vital role in ensuring optimal patient care by adhering to ethical practices and principles. They often encounter technical situations that demand careful consideration of the patient's well-being and the interests of their families. The principles of beneficence, non-maleficence, autonomy, and justice serve as guiding pillars for nurses to deliver high-quality care to their patients.

An ethical dilemma may arise when a nurse is faced with a situation like allowing Mr. Newcomb to meet his mistress. In such instances, aligning the decision with beneficence, autonomy, and justice principles becomes imperative. By enabling Mr. Newcomb to see his mistress, the nurse is respecting his autonomy and promoting his well-being, thus upholding the principles of beneficence and justice.

On the other hand, denying Mr. Newcomb's request could potentially harm his emotional well-being and conflict with the principle of non-maleficence. It is essential for nurses to navigate such complex scenarios by balancing the ethical principles at play to provide the best possible care for their patients.

Moreover, personal beliefs and values can significantly influence ethical decision-making in nursing practice. Nurses must reflect on their own biases and perspectives to ensure that their judgments are based on ethical considerations rather than personal preferences.

In addition to addressing ethical dilemmas, nurses also play a crucial role in promoting self-care among patients. Encouraging healthy habits such as proper nutrition, regular exercise, and maintaining social connections can contribute to the overall well-being of individuals under their care.

Ultimately, nurses are entrusted with the responsibility of upholding ethical principles to make informed decisions and deliver quality care to their patients. By integrating ethical values into their daily practice, nurses can navigate challenging situations with integrity and compassion, ultimately enhancing the overall patient experience and outcomes.
