In his analysis of modern European wars, Mearsheimer delves into the impact of power distribution on state behaviors and conflict. He contends that the presence of distinct poles of power can influence states' decisions to partake in hostilities, shaping the geopolitical landscape. Under a multipolar system, characterized by shifting power dynamics and increased rivalry, there tends to be a higher propensity for instability and conflict due to the fluid nature of relationships between nations. This unbalanced multipolarity, especially when a hegemon aggressively seeks to expand its influence, can instill fear in other states, prompting them to adopt more aggressive stances in response to perceived threats.

Contrastingly, Mearsheimer highlights that wars in modern Europe during a bipolar order were less frequent. In a bipolar setting, where power is evenly distributed between two dominant countries, there is a greater sense of equilibrium and mutual understanding that reduces the likelihood of conflicts erupting. However, Mearsheimer's theories encounter challenges in today's global context, where the lines between multipolarity and bipolarity are blurred, making it difficult to clearly define the prevailing world order.

Moreover, the proliferation of nuclear weapons in contemporary times emerges as a pivotal factor influencing the dynamics of warfare. Mearsheimer argues that the presence of nuclear arsenals holds more sway in determining conflict outcomes than the traditional balance of power. He emphasizes that nuclear weapons, by introducing the specter of total annihilation, have played a crucial role in averting large-scale conflicts in a bipolar Europe. The fear of catastrophic nuclear war surpasses the influence of power dynamics in maintaining peace and preventing confrontations among states.
