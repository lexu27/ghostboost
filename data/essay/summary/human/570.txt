In Suzanne Collins' novel, "The Hunger Games," social class disparities between the ordinary citizens of the twelve districts and the affluent Capitol residents are starkly portrayed. The residents of the districts, such as District Twelve, endure harsh conditions and injustice in contrast to the opulent lifestyle enjoyed by those in the Capitol. The narrative follows the challenging journey of protagonists Peeta and Katniss as they navigate the harsh realities of their world to support their families and survive.

Within the confines of Panem, the Capitol stands as a symbol of extravagance and excess, while the districts grapple with poverty, deprivation, and stringent regulations on their daily lives. The Capitol's oppressive regime is designed to undermine the well-being of the people in the districts, perpetuating their suffering and hardship. A disturbing annual spectacle known as the hunger games serves as entertainment for the Capitol residents, where contestants engage in a brutal fight to the death, further emphasizing the ruthless nature of the Capitol's governance.

Katniss, hailing from District Twelve, is unwillingly thrust into the hunger games, shedding light on the Capitol's callous disregard for the value of ordinary lives. Through the character of Katniss, Collins exposes the exploitation and cruelty embedded within the social hierarchy of Panem. The author skillfully crafts a narrative that underscores the stark contrast between the privileged elite in the Capitol and the marginalized populace struggling for mere survival in the districts.

Overall, "The Hunger Games" serves as a poignant commentary on societal inequality, power dynamics, and the resilience of the human spirit in the face of adversity. Collins masterfully depicts a reality where the Capitol thrives on the suffering of the districts, while ordinary individuals fight tirelessly for their existence. Through the lens of Peeta and Katniss, readers are confronted with the harsh realities of a world where hardship and sacrifice coexist with opulence and indifference, leaving a lasting impression of a society divided by class and rife with injustice.
