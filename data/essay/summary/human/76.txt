The adversarial criminal justice system is designed to treat all members of society equally under the law by presuming innocence and placing the burden of proof on the prosecution to demonstrate guilt beyond doubt. This system provides defendants with various advantages, such as the right to remain silent, the right to appeal, the right to have an attorney, and protection from unauthorized searches and arrests. Due to its procedural safeguards, the system often favors the accused, making it difficult for the prosecution to establish guilt.

However, the adversarial nature of the system creates a dynamic where both sides - the defense and the prosecution - engage in a competitive battle to secure a favorable outcome, potentially leading to ethical concerns and a reliance on legal maneuvers rather than factual evidence. Additionally, racial disparities persist within the American criminal justice system, with black individuals facing a higher likelihood of arrest, conviction, and receiving longer prison sentences compared to their white counterparts. These disparities are often attributed to systemic racism and bias embedded within the system.

To address these issues and prevent injustices, it is crucial to allow both parties to present facts and arguments before judgment is passed. By promoting a fair and transparent process that prioritizes evidence over legal tactics, the criminal justice system can work towards ensuring equality and justice for all individuals, regardless of their race or background.
