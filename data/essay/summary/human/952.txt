Democracy, derived from the Greek words "demes" and "Kratos," translates to rule by the people. In ancient Athens, democracy was restricted to adult men, a far cry from the inclusivity found in modern democratic societies. While ancient Greece practiced direct democracies where citizens voted on policies directly, today's democracies predominantly operate on a representative basis due to the impracticality of direct democracy in large populations. Despite these differences, the fundamental concept of democracy - the people exerting political power - has remained a constant throughout history. The shift from ancient to modern democratic structures is not a deviation from democratic principles but rather a reflection of societal progression. This evolution underscores how democracies adapt to the changing needs and complexities of society while preserving the core value of citizens' participation in governance.
