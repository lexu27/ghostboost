The Chinese internet industry has witnessed substantial growth over the past decade, thriving within the unique online landscape of the country. This growth has been propelled by the significant global economic connections of the three major Chinese internet giants. The Chinese government's strategic focus on improving communication networks has played a crucial role in expanding the internet infrastructure nationwide.

Furthermore, the recent development of the Chinese internet sector involves a multifaceted relationship involving the State, internet enterprises, and foreign financial investments. The emergence of the concept of "financialization" underscores the escalating influence of finance on the economy, financial markets, and investment institutions. This phenomenon not only affects macroeconomic conditions but also reshapes financial market frameworks, impacts corporate behavior, and influences economic policies.

One notable consequence of financialization is the disparity in income growth, with the financial sector experiencing higher income increases compared to other sectors. However, the risks associated with financialization cannot be ignored, as financial crises triggered by this phenomenon can result in enduring revenue setbacks, particularly affecting the less affluent segments of society and contributing to rising unemployment rates. It is imperative for stakeholders to navigate the complexities of financialization prudently to mitigate adverse outcomes and foster sustainable economic growth.
