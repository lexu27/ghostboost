In 2021, the Joint Commission outlined seven critical patient safety goals for hospitals to prioritize in order to enhance care quality and safety for patients. One key focus area is leveraging new evidence on emerging patient safety issues to shape goals for the upcoming year. This proactive approach allows hospitals to stay current with best practices and deliver advanced care to patients.

Proper patient identification is highlighted as a crucial step in preventing misdiagnosis and mistreatment. Using identifiers such as a person's name, ID number, or unique identifier is recommended to accurately match patients with their medical records and treatments. Ensuring accurate patient identification can significantly reduce errors and enhance the overall quality of care provided.

The labeling of medications and solutions in perioperative and procedural settings is emphasized as an essential practice to prevent errors and enhance patient safety. By marking all containers, healthcare providers can easily track contents, reduce risks associated with unlabeled items, and improve overall patient outcomes.

Another significant focus area is reducing harm associated with anticoagulant therapy, particularly in conditions such as atrial fibrillation, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and mechanical heart valve implantation. Patient education is highlighted as a critical component in optimizing anticoagulation therapy outcomes and minimizing adverse events, underscoring the importance of patient engagement in their own care.

Clear and consistent communication of patient medication information, reconciliation of prescriptions, and robust data collection practices are essential in ensuring safe prescribing practices and minimizing medication errors. By prioritizing these communication strategies, healthcare organizations can enhance patient safety, reduce the likelihood of adverse drug events, and improve overall care quality.

Organizations are urged to prioritize patient safety by implementing effective strategies to identify and address medication inconsistencies, ensuring the safe and accurate delivery of medications to patients. By focusing on these patient safety goals, hospitals can enhance care quality, reduce risks, and improve outcomes for patients, ultimately creating a safer and more effective healthcare environment for all individuals involved.
