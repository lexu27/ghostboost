In the essay "The Sum of Us" by Heather McGhee, the concept of the "zero-sum story" is explored as a belief system that perceives competition between racial groups, where advancements made by one group are seen as detrimental to others. This detrimental mindset, prevalent in conservative media, has far-reaching negative effects on the United States, resulting in economic, political, and social costs that impact all citizens. McGhee underscores this point by discussing historical instances such as the segregation and subsequent closure of public swimming pools due to resistance against integration. This example serves to illustrate how the zero-sum paradigm obstructs progress towards social justice and collective benefits when different racial groups strive for equitable policies. By providing factual and statistical evidence, McGhee effectively demonstrates the existence of entrenched social and economic problems in the United States that stem from systemic racism. Through her arguments, readers are compelled to contemplate the consequences of perpetuating divisive beliefs and the urgent need for fostering inclusive and equitable solutions to address the disparities that continue to plague American society.
