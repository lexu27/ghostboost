The rise of technology in today's society has brought about a shift in priorities, with many individuals placing more importance on scrolling through timelines than on getting adequate sleep. This trend is particularly concerning for teenagers, who often lack control over their free time and the information they are exposed to on social networks, making them especially susceptible to negative repercussions.

Excessive internet usage has been linked to a myriad of health issues, both mental and physical, while also increasing the likelihood of falling victim to online scams. Studies have been conducted to examine the impact of the internet on adolescents, aiming to pinpoint the dangers, root causes, and potential solutions to mitigate these risks.

Among the health concerns associated with heavy social media usage are chronic pain, vision problems, and sleep disorders, which are becoming increasingly prevalent among young people. Moreover, social media platforms have been implicated in the erosion of moral values among teenagers, normalizing behaviors such as smoking and alcohol consumption.

The widespread popularity of technology has significantly heightened teenagers' exposure to the sex industry, resulting in a surge in criminal activities and traumatic experiences. The unfiltered nature of online content poses a threat to the development of teenagers' personalities and behaviors, influencing them negatively in various ways.

To address these issues, it is imperative to regulate both the quantity and quality of online content that teenagers consume. Furthermore, raising awareness about the risks associated with excessive technology use is crucial in safeguarding the well-being of young individuals and steering them towards a healthier relationship with digital platforms. By prioritizing responsible online habits and fostering a greater understanding of the potential dangers, we can strive to create a safer and more wholesome online environment for teenagers to navigate.
