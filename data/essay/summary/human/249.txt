Evidence-based practice (EBP) training among nurses can significantly impact patient satisfaction with health care services. This project is dedicated to exploring the implications of EBP training on various aspects of nurses' and patients' well-being within hospital settings. The primary objectives of this project revolve around improving service quality by enhancing nurses' EBP knowledge, investigating the correlation between EBP training and nurses' job satisfaction, and developing a time-efficient training program tailored for hospital nurses.

Furthermore, the project aims to collect comprehensive feedback on patient satisfaction with nursing services. It underscores the significance of quality health care and social justice in ensuring equitable access to nursing care for all individuals. By addressing issues such as nurse burnout, lack of expertise, and their effects on patient autonomy and interaction, this project strives to create a conducive environment that fosters better patient outcomes and overall satisfaction.

An essential aspect of this initiative is to minimize personal concerns among nurses to guarantee that patients receive socially equitable and respectful treatment. By focusing on enhancing EBP knowledge and skills among nurses, this project not only improves the quality of care provided but also contributes to a more positive work environment for healthcare professionals. Ultimately, the project's multifaceted approach aims to elevate patient satisfaction levels while simultaneously supporting the well-being and job satisfaction of nurses in hospital settings.
