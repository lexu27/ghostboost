The impact of colonial conquest on native women in the Americas during the European invasion led to profound changes in social and economic structures within tribes. Chapter 5 delves into how the arrival of Europeans resulted in a shift of men's work, an increased demand for hunting, and the replacement of traditional women's roles with European goods. The spread of Christianity, particularly by the Catholic Jesuits, played a pivotal role in establishing patriarchal societies, where women often faced violence for resisting conversion.

In regions like New Mexico and Barbados, native and black women bore the brunt of enslavement, enduring various forms of exploitation and being stripped of basic rights. In New Spain, Spanish conquerors imposed their cultural norms on women, which often led to sexual abuse and exploitation in the name of maintaining Spanish traditions.

Chapter 6 shifts the focus to African women in the 17th century, shedding light on their social practices, marriage customs, and the diverse statuses they held within different tribes. The narrative of Queen Njinga serves as a compelling example of a woman who rose to power by adopting male attributes to assert her legitimacy as a ruler, successfully resisting Portuguese attacks in the process.

Moreover, Eur-African women, born to European fathers and African mothers, occupied a marginalized status in society. Despite their marginalized position, they skillfully leveraged their mixed heritage to acquire resources and elevate their status within their communities. This intricate interplay of heritage and societal positioning showcases the resilience and adaptability of women in navigating complex power dynamics during colonial times.

Through these historical accounts, it becomes evident that women in the Americas and Africa faced intersecting challenges during the era of colonial conquest. Their stories reflect not only the injustices and hardships they endured but also their agency and resilience in striving for autonomy and influence within systems that sought to subjugate them.
