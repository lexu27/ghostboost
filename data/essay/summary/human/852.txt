Blockchain technology is rapidly evolving and finding its way into various aspects of human life. The study conducted by Grech and Camilleri in 2017 sheds light on the application of blockchain within the realm of education, an area that is still in its nascent stages of exploration.

One of the key findings of the report is the disruptive potential of blockchain in education. Through its implementation, processes such as the issuance of qualifications, management of student records, and facilitating payments can be significantly transformed. By automating tasks like record verification, certificate validation, and license issuance, blockchain offers a streamlined and secure approach to handling educational data.

The report delves into eight scenarios illustrating how blockchain can be integrated into education, emphasizing the safeguarding of certificates and improving student identification. By instilling values such as trust, collaboration, transparency, and self-sovereignty, blockchain fosters an environment conducive to learning and innovation within the educational landscape.

Moreover, the report advocates for a collaborative approach towards the development of blockchain technology in education, encouraging both market players and public authorities to work together towards its advancement. By empowering students and revolutionizing the educational market, blockchain stands poised to bring about substantial changes in the way education is imparted and accessed.
