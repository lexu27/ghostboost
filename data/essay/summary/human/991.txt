Dyslexia is a learning disorder that affects children with normal eyesight and intellect, posing challenges in reading and word acquisition. Fortunately, with coaching and tailored educational interventions, most children with Dyslexia can improve their performance in school. However, the learning difficulties associated with Dyslexia can impact a child's ability to keep up with peers, leading to potential long-term repercussions if left untreated.

Untreated Dyslexia can give rise to issues like poor self-esteem, anxiety, anger, and social detachment from peers and teachers. Furthermore, undiagnosed Dyslexia during childhood can result in enduring challenges in adulthood, hindering success in various aspects of life. The presence of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) can further complicate the treatment of Dyslexia due to focus, hyperactivity, and impulsivity issues.

It is worth noting that Dyslexia is more common in males than females, yet it affects individuals of all ages, socioeconomic backgrounds, and ethnicities. Children born with Dyslexia struggle with reading, comprehension, and spelling, but may showcase strengths in areas like empathy. While the discussed article delves into the causes and effects of Dyslexia in children aged 4 to 10, it falls short in addressing gender differences and racial implications specific to the condition.

Overall, understanding Dyslexia and its implications is crucial in providing appropriate support and interventions for affected individuals. By raising public health awareness through initiatives like the capstone project mentioned, misconceptions about Dyslexia can be dispelled, fostering a more inclusive and supportive environment for those living with the condition.
