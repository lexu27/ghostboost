Corporate entrepreneurship is a strategic approach where internal teams within a corporation initiate and oversee new ventures that operate independently from the main organization while utilizing its resources. This practice allows companies to explore new opportunities and expand their market presence through innovation. Leading industry players such as Amazon and Samsung have been actively engaging in innovative projects to maintain their competitive edge in the market.

For instance, Amazon has introduced Amazon Custom, a platform that enables suppliers to offer personalized products on the e-commerce giant's marketplace. By combining both evolutionary and radical strategies, Amazon Custom not only enhances customer experience but also drives business growth through customized offerings. Similarly, Samsung adopts a proactive approach by entrusting new initiatives to a select group of creative individuals to ensure the implementation of best practices and achieve optimal results.

The industry's focus on innovation revolves around concepts such as open innovation and corporate technical reconnaissance, which emphasize the importance of collaboration and continuous learning from external sources. Moreover, the development of new products can be approached from either a bottom-up or top-down perspective, as demonstrated by the success stories of Apple's iPod and iPhone.

Central to achieving commercial success is the integration of creative behavior strategies within the organization. By fostering a culture that values human effort in generating fresh ideas, developing innovative products, and refining operational processes, companies can drive growth and maintain a competitive edge. Ultimately, the key to unlocking business potential lies in harmonizing business strategies with creative behavior and a relentless pursuit of innovation.
