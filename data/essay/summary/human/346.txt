Effective communication plays a vital role in shaping an individual's life, enabling the development of both oral and written speech. To effectively convey thoughts and ideas to others, it is crucial to have a good understanding of the basic rules of speech culture. Public figures such as Martin Luther King Jr. and Alicia Garza exemplify how body language can be utilized to captivate and engage audiences during speeches.

Both Martin Luther King Jr. and Alicia Garza focus on addressing issues related to racism and inequality, particularly concerning the black community. King emphasizes the importance of civil and economic rights, equality, and the unity of all individuals regardless of race. On the other hand, Garza advocates for equality, tolerance, and the continual fight against racism in modern society.

One notable difference between the speaking styles of King and Garza lies in their delivery techniques. King is known for his passionate and emotionally charged speeches, often delivered in a theatrical manner that leaves a lasting impact on the audience. In contrast, Garza adopts a calmer and more fact-based approach to convey her message effectively.

The setting of a speech, the understanding of the audience, and the chosen delivery style all play significant roles in determining the overall impact of a speech. Factors such as the location of the speech and the speaker's ability to connect with the audience can greatly influence how the message is received and understood.

In conclusion, effective communication is not only about speaking but also about connecting with others on a deeper level. By studying the approaches of influential speakers like Martin Luther King Jr. and Alicia Garza, individuals can learn valuable lessons about the power of speech, body language, and the impact of delivering a message with clarity and conviction.
