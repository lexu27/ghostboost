Biblical scholarship delves into the synoptic problem, examining the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John to unveil similarities and differences among them. When scrutinizing Matthew, Mark, and Luke, it becomes apparent that while some content overlaps, each writer also incorporates exclusive material unique to their Gospel account. Mark's Gospel stands out with original content in roughly 30 out of over 650 verses, with a substantial portion of this content echoed in Matthew and Luke's writings. Interestingly, the distinctiveness of Matthew and Luke lies in their emphasis on the Savior's words over His actions, showcasing a nuanced approach to portraying His teachings.

The variations in the texts can be attributed to the authors drawing from different traditions in narrating events, such as the portrayal of the parable of the workers in the vineyard. On the other hand, the Gospel of John takes a divergent path by introducing unique events and teachings not present in the Synoptic Gospels, offering readers detailed theological discourses. John's Gospel, in its distinctive narrative style, introduces discrepancies with the Synoptics on certain events, underscoring a separate textual structure and content that sets it apart from the other three Gospels.

Despite the evident differences in content and emphasis among the four Gospels, there exist fundamental commonalities in how key events are recounted, reflecting a shared understanding of the significance of these occurrences. This consensus on essential narratives underscores the coherence and interconnectedness among the Gospel accounts, despite the individual authorial nuances and interpretative choices made by Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Through a comprehensive exploration of the synoptic problem, biblical scholars continue to unravel the intricate tapestry of the Gospels, shedding light on both their harmonies and divergences in portraying the life and teachings of Jesus Christ.
