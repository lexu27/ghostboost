Emile Durkheim's theory of functionalism underscores the intricate interconnectedness of all facets within society, drawing parallels to the workings of a biological organism. According to Durkheim, a collective conscience molds individual behavior and societal norms, exerting a profound influence on social cohesion. On the contrary, Karl Marx's conflict theory posits that society operates as a system rife with perpetual class conflicts stemming from the uneven distribution of resources among its members. Conflict theory champions individualism and estrangement, diametrically opposing functionalism's advocacy for collectivism and social harmony.

Functionalism strives for the stability and smooth operation of every component within society, aiming to maintain equilibrium and order. Conversely, conflict theory underscores the necessity for societal transformation and upheaval to rectify inherent injustices. These two contrasting perspectives on the structure and operation of society underscore the fundamental disparities between functionalism and conflict theory. While functionalism underscores unity and predictability as vital components for societal well-being, conflict theory endeavors to eradicate misconceptions and class divides that perpetuate societal discord.

In essence, functionalism and conflict theory present irreconcilable differences in their approaches to understanding and improving society. Functionalism accentuates the significance of coherence and harmony, advocating for a structured and sustainable social framework. In stark contrast, conflict theory pushes for a paradigm shift, challenging existing power dynamics to create a more equitable and inclusive society. The conflicting nature of functionalism and conflict theory arises from their divergent viewpoints on the essence of society, making them inherently incompatible in their ultimate goals and aspirations.
