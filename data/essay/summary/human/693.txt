Toby Green's book "The Rise of the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade in Western Africa, 1300â€“1589" delves into the historical landscape of Iberia and West Africa during the 14th and 15th centuries, exploring the catalysts that sparked interactions between Europeans and Africans. Despite its title, the book predominantly zooms in on the era spanning from 1460 to 1589, pinpointing the Cape Verde Islands as a pivotal center for the slave trade during this period.

Green meticulously dissects how European settlers harnessed enslaved Africans for agricultural endeavors in Cape Verde, shaped by a backdrop of violence and exclusion in Europe. Drawing parallels with diverse historical slave trades such as the trans-Saharan trade and the early Portuguese trade from Upper Guinea, the book offers a comparative analysis to elucidate the unique dynamics of the African slave trade.

Utilizing archival sources, Green's narrative intricately maps out the coastal and island nodes of the Iberian trade, unraveling the intricate web of connections between Africa, Europe, and the Americas. He challenges conventional assumptions by contending that historical estimates of enslaved Africans ferried on slave ships are underestimated, although he welcomes the scrutiny of quantitative methodologies to reassess this contention.

In a bid to reshape historical discourse, Green refutes the notion that African gold superseded the significance of slaves for early European traders in Africa. By spotlighting Cape Verde and Upper Guinea, the book redefines the contours of the transatlantic slave trade, diverging from established historical accounts that predominantly focus on West-Central Africa.

While Green's narrative enriches our comprehension of the Atlantic world's genesis, its implications on broader historical trajectories like African colonization and economic globalization remain debatable. Furthermore, his argument regarding the influence of the decimation of the Native American population on the influx of Africans to the Americas encounters skepticism, given preexisting data on labor scarcities and escalating demand for enslaved labor.

In essence, Green's scholarly inquiry not only sheds light on the complex tapestry of the trans-Atlantic slave trade but also serves as a springboard for reevaluating entrenched historical narratives, underscoring the intricate interplay of power, exploitation, and commerce that underpinned this harrowing chapter in human history.
