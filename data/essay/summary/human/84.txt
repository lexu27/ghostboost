The study examined how a helpful message included on dining checks influences tip percentages, with the independent variable being the presence of a helpful message and the dependent variable being the tip percentage. Various confounding variables such as food quality, server's gender, dining party size, and customer regularity were identified. The design of the study was commended for its transparency, simplicity in implementation, and potential for replication. However, challenges arose from variations in message content, a limited sample of restaurants, and the potential impact on tipping outcomes. The study left uncertainty regarding whether the presence of the message or its content primarily drove the outcomes.

To address these uncertainties, suggestions for further research included exploring different message content variations and implementing random waiter assignments. The study highlighted the importance of consistent server behavior and the influence of varying attitudes on tip amounts, impacting internal validity. Furthermore, limitations in external validity were noted, particularly related to potential gender bias and variations in settings affecting the results. The recommendation for additional group inclusion and adjustments in study methodology was made to ensure a more comprehensive analysis of the subject matter.

In conclusion, the study shed light on the significant impact of a helpful message on tip percentages in the dining context, emphasizing the need for further exploration and refinement in future research to address the identified challenges and limitations. By considering the implications of message content variations, randomization in waiter assignments, and broader group inclusion, future studies can provide a more nuanced understanding of how such interventions affect tipping behavior and contribute to the overall body of knowledge on this subject.
