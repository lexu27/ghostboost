Food preservation methods have been utilized for centuries, gaining particular significance during challenging economic periods such as the COVID-19 pandemic. These methods, aimed at preventing spoilage of perishable food items, have evolved over time to incorporate a variety of techniques centered around influencing microorganisms. Classification of food preservation techniques is often based on microbiological processes and spoilage mechanisms, resulting in diverse approaches to maintaining product integrity.

Storage methods are typically grouped into categories such as basic life maintenance, microbial destruction, suspension of microbe vital activity, and harnessing antagonistic relationships between microorganisms. While traditional preservation methods like pasteurization and drying remain prevalent, newer technologies like ultrasonic treatment, ozone processing, nanotechnology, and impulsive electric fields are being explored for their potential in extending shelf life and enhancing food safety.

In the food industry, products are evaluated using different criteria including spoilage mechanisms, processing technologies, and packaging methods. Spoilage mechanisms encompass physical, microbiological, and chemical factors, all of which can be addressed through various preservation techniques. These methods range from physical interventions like pasteurization to biological processes such as fermentation, and chemical methods like pH control and canning with ethyl alcohol.

Packaging also plays a crucial role in chemical preservation methods, ensuring sanitary safety and prolonging product freshness. Ongoing research in the field of food preservation aims to discover innovative and environmentally friendly processing options, such as nanotechnology and ultrasound, to further extend the shelf life of perishable goods. By continually exploring new preservation approaches and technologies, the food industry strives to meet the demand for fresh, safe, and sustainable food products in an ever-changing world.
