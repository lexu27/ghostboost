The Coptic community in Egypt has a rich history marred by persistent persecution dating back to the Arab conquest. Coptic Christians, specifically, are frequent targets of violence, including terrorist attacks and killings. This persecution extends to everyday life, with ordinary Muslims in Egypt often opposing them, and extremist groups like ISIS posing a significant threat. One factor exacerbating their plight is the fact that their religious identity is prominently displayed on Egyptian passports, making them easy targets for discrimination and violence.

Discrimination against Copts is widespread, affecting various aspects of their daily lives such as employment, access to healthcare in hospitals, and opportunities for education in schools and universities. Particularly alarming is the abduction of Coptic women by terrorists who force them into marriages with Muslim men, often resulting in coerced religious conversions. Furthermore, church leaders and areas populated by Copts are frequently targeted by radicalized individuals, leading to a pervasive atmosphere of fear and insecurity within the community.

Despite the sizeable Coptic population and the support they receive from Catholic, Orthodox Christians, and others, neighboring countries have largely remained passive, failing to intervene decisively in the conflict. Governments have been reluctant to interfere due to the involvement of terrorist organizations like ISIS and the complex, deep-rooted nature of the historical tensions between Copts and other religious groups in the region. This hesitance further compounds the challenges faced by the Coptic community in Egypt, leaving them vulnerable to continued persecution and violence without significant external assistance.
