In 2014, Sony Pictures Entertainment found itself at the center of a cyber attack orchestrated by North Korea, triggered by the release of the film "The Interview" which depicted Kim Jong Un in a negative light. This attack resulted in substantial losses for the company and brought forth threats of violence against theaters planning to screen the controversial film. In response to the escalating situation, Sony made the unprecedented decision to pull the movie from theatrical release and instead opted to make it available on on-demand platforms. While this move ensured widespread access to the film, it also inadvertently fueled piracy issues.

The strategic shift in releasing the film was viewed as a countermeasure, using the opponent's own tactics against them to sway public opinion regarding the threats posed by North Korea. However, Sony's handling of the crisis sparked debates about the implications of yielding to terrorist demands and shed light on the critical need for enhanced cyber security protocols within the entertainment industry. The incident served as a wake-up call, emphasizing the significance of promptly identifying vulnerabilities and the collaborative efforts essential to thwarting potential cyber threats in the future.

Following the cyber attack, recommendations surfaced urging both Sony and the U.S. government to bolster their cyber security strategies to mitigate similar risks effectively. The ordeal underscored the necessity for updated cyber security regulations and robust systems to safeguard against prospective attacks, reinforcing the notion that proactive measures are imperative in safeguarding sensitive data and infrastructure from malicious entities. Ultimately, the Sony Pictures cyber attack of 2014 underscored the crucial role of cyber security in today's digital landscape and highlighted the ongoing need for continuous improvement and vigilance to combat evolving cyber threats.
