Robert Nozick delves into "The Entitlement Theory," shedding light on the essence of a just economic framework and the significance of property rights within it. In his exploration, Nozick underscores the pivotal role of fair acquisition, fair transfer, and ratification as fundamental principles of just entitlement. Fair acquisition, as advocated by Nozick, permits individuals to possess property as long as it does not infringe upon the rights of others. This notion is intertwined with the concept of fair transfer, wherein individuals hold the right to voluntary exchange or donation of property without coercion.

Furthermore, Nozick envisions a societal structure where the mechanisms of free exchange render the necessity of a currency intermediary obsolete, emphasizing the autonomy and liberty of individuals in their property dealings. The principle of ratification, according to Nozick, necessitates the restitution of unfairly obtained property to its rightful owner, underlining the importance of rectifying past injustices. Notably, Nozick posits that genuine property rights are reserved for those who adhere to the principles of fair acquisition and transfer, highlighting the ethical underpinning of property ownership.

Moreover, Nozick's stance on fair distribution underscores its historical context, emphasizing its interconnectedness with the circumstances surrounding the fairness of acquisition. In parallel with John Locke's concept of self-property, Nozick accentuates the role of individuals' talents and efforts in contributing to the legitimacy of their property ownership. Through his discourse on just entitlement and property rights, Nozick aligns himself with a philosophical lineage that accentuates individual agency, fairness, and ethical considerations in shaping societal structures.
