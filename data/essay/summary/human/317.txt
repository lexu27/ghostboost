The framers of the Constitution expressed skepticism about citizens' interest in political affairs and their involvement in the nation's political landscape. Historically, limited access to information posed challenges to people being well-versed in political matters. However, in contemporary society, the mass media plays a pivotal role in ensuring people are informed and acts as a guardian overseeing governmental actions. Information agencies diligently report on events, enabling readers to develop perspectives and exchange views on various issues. While the media is a valuable source of political information, individuals are advised against relying solely on it and encouraged to actively participate in following the political developments of the country.

Civil rights organizations and advocacy groups play a significant role in monitoring political events to uphold freedoms and civil liberties. Present-day citizens exhibit a proactive stance in staying informed and expressing their viewpoints without waiting for crises to emerge. The media serves as a critical conduit for information, granting access to global events and fostering a more interconnected world. Those who actively engage in voicing opinions and scrutinizing political activities deserve admiration for their role as overseers of government powers. Ultimately, a well-informed and active citizenry is essential for the functioning of a healthy democracy where the media, individuals, and advocacy groups collectively contribute to upholding transparency, accountability, and democratic values.
