One of the commonly used map projections, the Mercator projection, has long been criticized for its failure to accurately represent the true size of countries. This projection has faced complaints about bias, notably exemplified by Greenland and Africa appearing to be the same size on it. Furthermore, the Mercator projection exaggerates the size of Europe and North America while minimizing Greenland's actual size.

In response to these issues, a new life-size map has emerged that provides a more accurate representation of the African Continent. Distorted sizes on maps can lead to a skewed understanding of the world, potentially enhancing the perceived importance of white nations over non-white nations. It is essential to recognize how map projections can influence our perspectives and narratives about different regions.

For a more precise depiction of the Earth, Google Maps offers an alternative with a globe representation at higher zoom settings. This feature allows users to explore the spherical nature of our planet and gain a more accurate understanding of its geography. In a globalized world, comprehending map projections and the Earth's true form is crucial for fostering informed perspectives and promoting geographical literacy among individuals.
