Care ethics theory has faced criticism for its resemblance to slave morality, drawing parallels to Nietzsche's concept. Critics argue that the mindset of caregivers in providing care is perceived as a weakness that reinforces oppression. Furthermore, caregivers' tendency to show favoritism towards relatives, friends, and locals over others in need has been a point of contention.

Advocates of care ethics, however, advocate for considering the emotional context alongside traditional moral reasoning. Held, for instance, highlights the importance of a universal moral theory that incorporates women's experiences, aiming to address gender bias that has influenced perceptions of public and private moral spheres within care ethics. Feminists seek to redefine morality in both public and private life, breaking free from gender stereotypes.

One key aspect emphasized in care ethics is the interconnection between public and private behaviors. By recognizing the intricate relationships between these spheres, proponents of care ethics strive to create a more holistic approach to moral philosophy that acknowledges the complexities of human interactions and the importance of empathy and compassion in ethical decision-making.
