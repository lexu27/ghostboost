The increase in smart device users has resulted in a substantial rise in data generation, leading to the classification of this data as big data due to its sheer volume and complexity. Major service providers such as Microsoft, Amazon, and Yahoo have established geographically dispersed data centers to process massive amounts of data efficiently and in a timely manner. To handle such enormous datasets effectively, these providers commonly utilize tools like Hadoop and SPARK. 

In the realm of big data, focusing on the underlying infrastructure is vital for the successful deployment of related solutions. Cloud technology has emerged as a crucial enabler, optimizing and simplifying various challenges encountered in dealing with big data in business applications. Cloud solutions specifically target issues such as data storage, infrastructure flexibility, and data backup, thereby enhancing the overall resilience of the system.

The significance of big data in the business landscape cannot be overstated, as it plays a pivotal role in audience identification, market research, and decision-making processes based on accurate and precise information. By integrating big data into their operations, companies can streamline their processes, gain valuable insights, and make well-informed decisions that can positively impact their bottom line.
