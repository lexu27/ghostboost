The 19th and early 20th centuries marked a significant shift in the art world, where artists veered away from traditional realism to express their emotions on canvas. This period saw the rise of Expressionism, a movement characterized by intense feelings and emotionalism akin to the Romantic era. Notable artists such as Delacroix and Munch embraced this style to convey themes of violence, desperation, and alienation in their works, delving deep into the human psyche to evoke raw emotions.

Expressionism also delved into fierce representations, including the exploration of women's sexuality, which became a popular subject during this transformative period. The early 20th century witnessed a revolution in art, with a new generation of painters forming groups like Die Brucke to break away from traditional artistic norms and explore innovative directions. Artists from Germany and Austria took inspiration from the industrial revolution and spiritual culture, creating sculptures that reflected the changing societal landscape.

Visionaries like Kandinsky, Munter, and Macke captured the essence of modern relationships and societal transformations in their artworks, providing a mirror to the evolving world around them. Sculptures, such as Wilhelm Lehmbruck's "Kneeling Woman," depicted themes of melancholy and loss, symbolizing the personal struggles and societal issues prevalent during that tumultuous era.

In essence, the art of the 19th and early 20th centuries was a testament to the power of emotions and expressionism, where artists defied conventions to create works that resonated with the human experience on a deep and visceral level. Through their art, they not only captured the essence of their time but also paved the way for future generations to explore new realms of creativity and emotional depth.
