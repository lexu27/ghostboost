Self-immolation has been a powerful form of protest throughout history, with notable examples like Thich Quang Duc in Saigon in 1963 and Mohammed Bouazizi in Tunisia. Thich Quang Duc's self-immolation in Saigon became a symbol of rebellion against injustice, sparking a revolution and defying a corrupt government. Similarly, Mohammed Bouazizi's self-immolation in Tunisia triggered mass protests against President Ben Ali's regime, fueled by economic and social issues. Bouazizi's act became a symbol of the Arab Spring, inspiring protests across Tunisia and other Arab countries.

These extreme acts of self-immolation have influenced political events by serving as a drastic measure when other means of communication with authorities failed. Despite not being direct calls for revolution, the events surrounding Duc and Bouazizi had a profound impact on history, highlighting their rejection of the system and their inability to tolerate injustice. Self-immolation, as seen in these cases, represents a last resort for individuals to express their discontent and challenge oppressive regimes, making a statement that echoes far beyond their personal suffering.
