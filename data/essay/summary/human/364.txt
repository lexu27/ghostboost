Edward Said's concept of orientalism sheds light on the notion that the Western understanding of the East is not founded on factual information but rather on fabricated perceptions that perpetuate Western dominance over Eastern societies. Particularly in the context of the Islam community, the global perspective is significantly shaped by orientalist portrayals in American newspapers. This paper delves into the investigation of the accuracy of Said's argument regarding the prevalence of orientalism in newspaper representations. By exploring whether orientalism indeed prevails in media narratives, the study aims to determine the extent to which newspapers exploit orientalist tropes to capture public interest.
