The Dayak community is portrayed as embracing an idyllic outlook on sex and gender, emphasizing the empowerment of individuals based on their distinctive traits. In stark contrast to Western societies, where gender differences often spark conflicts and negative stereotypes, the Dayak culture perceives these distinctions as advantageous. Western cultures tend to exalt hypermasculinity and aggression, creating a societal environment that diverges significantly from the egalitarian values upheld by the Dayak community. The misconceptions surrounding rape, often inaccurately linked to biological inclinations, are more accurately reflections of societal norms and beliefs. Throughout history, society has constructed stigmas and biases related to sexual violence, depicting victims through a lens of passive femininity and attributing a prescriptive form of masculinity to the perpetrators. The conservative nature of attitudes towards rape has persisted for generations, shaping the values and understandings within society. The inherent characteristics of genders, such as strength for men and femininity for women, are accentuated, while social constructs play a crucial role in shaping the interpretations of these traits. The Dayak culture's viewpoint on gender serves as a stark juxtaposition with the Western perspective, underscoring the significant influence of societal values on individual behaviors and attitudes.
