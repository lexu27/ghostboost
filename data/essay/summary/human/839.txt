Backpacking tourism has transcended being a simple travel trend to become a dynamic movement that continually adapts to the evolving needs and preferences of modern backpackers. Researchers are delving into the latest developments within backpacking tourism to uncover ways in which the hospitality industry can align itself with these trends effectively. The literature review in this field seeks to delve into the appeal of backpacking to younger generations, delve into the strategies that hostels employ to enrich traveler experiences, and propose sustainable solutions to ensure the longevity of these backpacking trends.

The roots of backpacking go back several decades when it emerged as a distinctive phenomenon, notably explored in the realm of unconventional tourism by Cohen during the 1970s. What was once a niche activity has now evolved into a mainstream form of institutionalized tourism and a chosen lifestyle for many individuals, particularly resonating with the younger demographic. While backpackers today hail from diverse age groups, it is the younger generation that predominantly engages in this form of travel.

For many backpackers, their explorations go beyond mere vacations and are deeply intertwined with their identities, leading them to label themselves as "lifestyle travelers." The allure of backpacking lies in its ability to offer a sense of freedom, adventure, and connection with different cultures, making it a compelling choice for those seeking experiential journeys. In some cases, individuals have taken their passion for backpacking to the next level, turning it into their primary occupation and a sustainable way of life.

As backpacking tourism continues to evolve and attract a broad spectrum of participants, including digital nomads and adventure seekers, the industry must stay attuned to these shifting trends. By understanding the motivations and preferences of modern backpackers, hostels and other stakeholders in the hospitality sector can tailor their offerings to cater to this vibrant community effectively. Embracing the spirit of exploration, community, and sustainability, backpacking remains a dynamic force in the realm of travel, promising enriching experiences for those who embark on this liberating journey.
