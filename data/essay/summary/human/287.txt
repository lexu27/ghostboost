Gnomial Functions Inc. is dedicated to finding a dependable forecasting technique for projecting sales over the next eighteen months. The sales trend observed in the past 18 months has displayed consistent growth with minimal seasonal fluctuations, indicating a stable pattern. Recent sales figures have been identified as having a substantial influence on future sales performance.

To enhance accuracy in sales forecasting, the utilization of a weighted moving average approach is recommended. This method involves assigning four different weights varying between 0.1 to 0.4, with a focus on emphasizing recent sales data. By adjusting the weights for the moving average and assigning a higher weight to recent sales, the forecast error can be minimized effectively.

Furthermore, refining the weights to values of 0, 0, 0.4, and 0.6 has shown to yield improved forecasting results. This adjustment leads to a reduction in both the mean absolute deviation and mean standard error compared to the initial weight distribution. The weighted moving average technique is lauded for its simplicity, effectiveness, and reliability in forecasting future sales performance.

Moreover, the flexibility of this method allows for easy modifications in weight distribution to accommodate shifts in sales trends. By adjusting the weights according to the evolving sales patterns, the forecasting model can accurately capture changes in sales performance over time. Consequently, the weighted moving average serves as a valuable tool in strategic sales planning and decision-making processes for Gnomial Functions Inc.
