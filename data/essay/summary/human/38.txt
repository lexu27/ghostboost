The cultures of America and Lithuania have been shaped over many years by a variety of factors, including language, religion, and eating habits. However, there are more cultural variations in the United States compared to Lithuania, largely due to the higher number of immigrants in America. In terms of language, English is predominantly used in America, while Lithuanian is the primary language in Lithuania. 

When it comes to societal norms, Americans are generally perceived as more open, while Lithuanians tend to be more distant and reserved, often appearing unemotional. In communication, Americans place a high value on politeness and creative expressions for successful interactions, which are considered to be less important in Lithuania. 

Moreover, values in the United States are often passed down from parents and are influenced by religion, focusing on altruism, mutual assistance, and achieving professional fulfillment. On the other hand, family is highly valued as an integral part of life in Lithuania. Researchers have identified various differences between American and Lithuanian cultures, showcasing the unique characteristics that define each society.
