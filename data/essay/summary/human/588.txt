Globalization has transformed the economic landscape by creating opportunities for enterprises to thrive in competitive global markets. Sun City, with its promising prospects in active tourism and water sports, particularly surfing, stands to benefit from the growth in the entertainment industry. The surfing market, valued at $2.7 billion in 2020 and projected to reach $3.1 billion by 2026, presents lucrative opportunities for Sun City to capitalize on. However, to succeed in this competitive market, Sun City must prioritize customer satisfaction to distinguish itself from rivals.

Furthermore, outdoor activities like surfing not only contribute to the economic potential of Sun City but also promote eco-friendly tourism, attracting millions of enthusiasts worldwide. The increasing demand for new surfing destinations and sustainable technology underscores the importance of technical innovation and partnerships with global brands. Collaborating with established surfing brands such as Quiksilver, Rip Curl, and Billabong can enhance Sun City's reputation and attract a broader audience.

Despite challenges such as the COVID-19 pandemic, Sun City's affiliation with the politically stable United States remains attractive to tourists and investors, highlighting the significance of prioritizing safety over profit. By focusing on customer satisfaction, fostering eco-friendly practices, embracing technological advancements, and forming strategic partnerships, Sun City can position itself as a premier destination in the global surfing market while navigating the complexities of the evolving economic landscape.
