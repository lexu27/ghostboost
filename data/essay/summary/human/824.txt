Asian Health Services (AHS) encountered significant pressures as a result of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) affecting patient supply and the quality of care provided. The challenges faced by AHS revolved around the integration of uninsured clients into their system and the implementation of a pay-for-performance framework. To overcome these obstacles, AHS took proactive measures such as establishing an electronic medical records system, improving patient support services, and introducing new medical offerings. Despite these efforts, persistent issues remain, including the necessity for enhanced employee care, the recruitment of more multilingual staff, the introduction of incentives for healthcare providers, and the expansion of both medical and dental clinics. The decisions made by AHS are pivotal in enhancing their overall performance and addressing any emerging complexities effectively. By prioritizing these areas of improvement, AHS can optimize their outputs and navigate through the evolving landscape of healthcare provision with competence and success.
