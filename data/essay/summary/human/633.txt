Panama, a country that experienced robust economic growth prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, with an impressive average growth rate of 4.7% between 2014 and 2019, faced unprecedented challenges in 2020. The pandemic's impact was severe, causing Panama's labor income to plummet by 18% in 2020, subsequently leading to a worrying increase in the poverty rate across the nation.

However, amidst these trying times, Panama Solidario emerged as a beacon of hope, playing a crucial role in preventing a more significant spike in the poverty rate. Thanks to the efforts of Panama Solidario, the poverty rate was held at 14.9%, a deviation from the anticipated 18.8% that could have been reached without intervention.

Despite these measures, it is important to note that Panama's wealth distribution remains skewed, with a disproportionate concentration of wealth among high-class individuals in urban areas. This leaves rural residents significantly disadvantaged, facing greater economic hardships compared to their urban counterparts.

The labor market in Panama also bore the brunt of the pandemic, with the unemployment rate skyrocketing from 7.07% in 2019 to a staggering 18.55% in 2020. This sharp increase underscores the economic turmoil faced by the country during the pandemic.

In financial matters, Panama operates with the Panamanian Balboa as its official currency, which maintains a fixed exchange rate of 1:1 with the US dollar. This stability has been instrumental in fostering trade relations with countries like the US, China, Free Zones, and Singapore, attracting foreign investors seeking a secure political climate and a burgeoning economy.

Despite the challenges encountered in 2020, Panama's economy remains resilient and continues to grow steadily, with the service sector playing a pivotal role by contributing over 75% to the country's GDP. This resilience, coupled with strategic trade ties and a stable economic foundation, positions Panama favorably for continued growth and recovery beyond the pandemic-induced setbacks.
