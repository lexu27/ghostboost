Nephrology Dialysis Transplantation (NDT) stands as a reputable European journal sanctioned by the European Renal Association, delivering essential analysis and data for scientists worldwide. The article delves into the primary causes of chronic inflammation in end-stage renal failure, shedding light on the pivotal role of middle molecules in the pathology. Furthermore, it scrutinizes breakthroughs and research in the realm of dialysis to combat kidney damage and stabilize the condition. 

Chronic renal failure casts its shadow on 200-500 individuals out of one million, with the population grappling with a 10-12% annual rise. The symptoms of this condition advance from reduced urine excretion to acute renal failure, substantially affecting individuals' well-being and overall health. Notably, the prevalence rate of chronic renal failure hovers around 759 individuals per million, with 144 new cases emerging annually per million.

Diagnosing chronic renal failure necessitates comprehensive blood tests to assess creatinine, potassium, and urea levels. Additionally, ultrasound examinations and potential catheterization or angiography of the kidneys are vital diagnostic procedures. When it comes to treatment, managing end-stage kidney damage in adults predominantly involves medication to mitigate the condition and improve quality of life. 

In conclusion, the insights provided by Nephrology Dialysis Transplantation (NDT) serve as a beacon of knowledge for the scientific community, offering valuable information on chronic renal failure, its diagnosis, treatment, and impact on global health.
