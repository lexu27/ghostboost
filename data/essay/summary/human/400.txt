The Commercial Advertisement Loudness Mitigation (CALM) Act of 2012 brought relief to viewers by restricting the volume of TV commercials. This legislative action stemmed from a personal encounter with a blaring commercial by Congresswoman Anna Eshoo. While the Act initially reduced complaints, loopholes in the law allowed some advertisers to continue with overly loud ads. The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic saw a surge in television consumption, resulting in a 140% spike in grievances regarding excessive commercial noise. Despite its intentions, the effectiveness of the CALM Act remains debatable, as some advertisers employ sound compression techniques to circumvent volume constraints.
