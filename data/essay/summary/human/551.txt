Throughout history, various interventions have been implemented to ensure public safety, such as safety measures and quarantine protocols. One notable case is that of Mary Mallon, famously known as Typhoid Mary, who became the first healthy carrier of typhoid fever in the United States during the 20th century. Mallon's story is a tragic one, as she was isolated due to being a carrier of the typhoid bacteria and was accused of causing illnesses and deaths among those she came into contact with.

In a recent comparison made by Woolliscroft (2020), Mallon's case is likened to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting the critical responsibilities of public health in preventing the spread of diseases. An example that resonates with this comparison is the Novak Djokovic charity tournament in 2020, where despite safety efforts, a significant COVID-19 outbreak occurred. However, thanks to modern safety protocols and efficient quarantine measures, the impact of the Djokovic case was limited, showcasing the effectiveness of such strategies in controlling outbreaks.

It is evident that public health measures have vastly improved since Mallon's time, emphasizing the importance of promptly identifying disease carriers to prevent further transmission. Recommendations put forward include the need for rapid diagnosis, immediate isolation of infected individuals, thorough tracking of contacts, and promoting self-isolation to effectively manage and curb outbreaks.

Furthermore, nursing emerges as a pivotal player in global health, with a significant focus on raising awareness, fostering open communication, and implementing proactive solutions to combat infectious diseases. The role of nurses in advocating for public health measures and ensuring community well-being cannot be understated, as they serve on the front lines of healthcare delivery, making a tangible difference in disease prevention and control efforts.
