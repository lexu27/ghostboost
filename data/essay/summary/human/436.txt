In recent news, McDonald's found itself entangled in a legal battle with its former CEO, Steve Easterbrook, over allegations of engaging in undisclosed consensual sexual encounters with employees and concealing this information. The fast-food giant filed a lawsuit against Easterbrook for his misconduct, accusing him of misleading authorities and destroying evidence to serve his own interests, to the detriment of McDonald's. Consequently, shareholders took legal action against McDonald's, claiming that the company prioritized speed over accuracy in handling the situation and failed to prevent such misconduct.

The issue raised concerns about negligent recruitment and retention practices, highlighting an employer's responsibility not to hire or keep individuals who might exhibit harmful behavior. Employers can be held accountable for the intentional wrongdoing of their employees, emphasizing the importance of thorough vetting processes before hiring. Failure to conduct proper background checks on employees could result in the employer being held liable if the employee causes harm due to negligence.

McDonald's situation underscores the need for companies to address employees' risky or harmful behaviors promptly and decisively. Employers, including industry giants like McDonald's, must be diligent in ensuring that they do not overlook red flags during the hiring process or turn a blind eye to signs of potential misconduct. By neglecting to address such issues proactively, employers risk facing legal consequences and damage to their reputation. McDonald's serves as a cautionary tale, reminding businesses of the critical importance of upholding high standards of employee conduct and accountability in the workplace.
