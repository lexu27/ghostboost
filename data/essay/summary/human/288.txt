In the modern world economy, the landscape is incredibly diverse, making it challenging to predict and prepare for a crisis. When a crisis does occur, individuals instinctively revert to basic survival mechanisms such as fleeing, hiding, or doing whatever is necessary to survive the turmoil. Amidst these crises, a relatively new discipline known as crisis intervention has emerged, aimed at providing crucial emergency emotional support to victims of violence and trauma.

Economic downturns present a pervasive risk that can have far-reaching implications affecting entire populations. Non-profit organizations and their employees are particularly vulnerable during times of crisis, often facing layoffs and increased reliance on state assistance. Job scarcity and the escalation of poverty levels can compel individuals to abandon their homes in search of better opportunities, further exacerbating the social impact of a crisis.

The ripple effects of a crisis extend beyond individual hardships to impact the national economy as a whole, disrupting various sectors and straining credit resources. Additionally, maintaining international partnerships becomes a considerable challenge in the face of economic turmoil and uncertainty. The undesirable nature of a recession lies in its destructive tendencies and the unpredictable consequences it brings about, underscoring the importance of proactive crisis management strategies to mitigate potential harm and foster resilience in the face of adversity.
