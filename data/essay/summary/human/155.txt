The Code of Practice plays a crucial role in the realm of building construction by establishing standards and regulations aimed at managing environmental consequences effectively. This code specifically targets new developments with a primary goal of safeguarding the well-being of workers, the environment, and the public at large. One of the key focal points of the code is to stress the importance of maintaining a clear demarcation between densely populated areas and major hazard installations as a preventive measure against potential accidents.

Major hazard installations are singled out based on the presence of hazardous substances, necessitating them to be accorded top priority in terms of attention and control. Instances of such installations encompass oil refineries, chemical works, and storage facilities. Notably, it is essential to mention that the Code of Practice excludes nuclear and military hazards from its purview.

Various competent authorities are entrusted with the responsibility of overseeing major hazard control systems, including government bodies, police units, and safety authorities. These entities are pivotal in ensuring the enforcement and implementation of the regulations outlined in the code. Additionally, the code delineates a set of activities that these authorities are mandated to undertake in order to establish effective control systems that uphold safety standards and mitigate risks effectively. Through stringent adherence to the guidelines set forth in the Code of Practice, the construction industry can navigate the challenges posed by environmental repercussions and potential hazards, thereby fostering a safer and more sustainable built environment for all stakeholders involved.
