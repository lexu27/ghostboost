Electronic nicotine delivery systems, such as e-cigarettes, have sparked concerns due to their potential to cause severe harm to the human body comparable to traditional tobacco products. The detrimental effects of e-cigarettes stem from solvents like polyhydric alcohol, which can harm cell membranes and lead to various illnesses. In 2019, the United States witnessed a surge in apprehensions regarding the negative impact of vaping on health following reports of severe respiratory illnesses and deaths linked to vaping products. Particularly, EVALI, a lung injury associated with e-cigarette use, resulted in numerous fatalities and thousands of reported cases of vaping-related illnesses. 

To address these issues, there is a growing call for e-cigarettes to be regulated similarly to traditional tobacco products, including imposing restrictions on sales to young individuals to mitigate health risks. Despite lacking the tar and odor of conventional cigarettes, e-cigarettes still pose significant health hazards due to their composition and the vapor they emit. It is suggested that the sale of e-cigarettes should be restricted to individuals over 18 years old, with considerations for mandatory medical evaluations to assess the risks of vaping-related illnesses. Additionally, there is a push for legislation aimed at reducing the consumption of electronic cigarettes by ensuring that only certified products meeting safety standards are available for purchase. By implementing these regulatory measures, it is hoped that the health risks associated with e-cigarette use can be mitigated, safeguarding public health and well-being.
