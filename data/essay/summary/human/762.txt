Latin America's fight for independence marked a pivotal moment in history, ushering in a new era of sovereignty for former Spanish and Portuguese colonies. The liberation movement was spearheaded by Creole landlords, who, in the absence of a strong colonial bourgeoisie, played a crucial role in galvanizing the push for freedom. This movement was fueled by widespread discontent among various social groups, including Creoles, bourgeoisie, and peasants, who found themselves increasingly marginalized and exploited under colonial rule.

The struggle for independence not only symbolized a quest for political autonomy but also served the economic interests of Latin America. Colonial policies and exploitation had hindered capitalist development in the region, prompting the need to break free from oppressive colonial regimes. The timing was ripe for rebellion, as Spain's involvement in wars created a favorable international climate for the Creole opposition's activities aimed at securing independence.

Central to the aspirations of Creole entrepreneurs was the desire for unrestricted access to global markets. They championed liberal ideologies that advocated for trade and enterprise freedom, recognizing the potential benefits of embracing capitalism and engaging in international trade. The quest for independence culminated in the establishment of republican systems across Latin America, marking the abolition of slavery, curbing church influence, and granting exemptions to indigenous populations.

The newfound independence not only granted political autonomy but also paved the way for Latin American countries to participate in international trade, fostering capitalist relations and opening doors to economic growth and prosperity. By breaking free from colonial shackles, Latin America embarked on a journey towards self-determination, economic progress, and forging new alliances on the global stage.
