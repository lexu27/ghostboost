Family plays a pivotal role in the education of children from bilingual immigrant families, where cultural disparities and language barriers often present challenges. To bridge the gap between teachers and parents, enhancing communication and support for dual language learners (DLL), family engagement is deemed essential. The educational system in the United States underscores the significance of involving families in learning strategies tailored for DLLs.

Various concepts, including cultural capital, social capital, and human capital, are instrumental in shaping the educational landscape for DLLs. These concepts contribute to a holistic approach that acknowledges the diverse backgrounds and needs of students from bilingual immigrant families. Scholarly discussions advocate for the family engagement model, citing its positive influence on student outcomes and overall academic success.

Consultations between teachers and families are indispensable for fostering a collaborative environment between home and school, leading to improved student achievement. By establishing effective communication channels and mutual understanding, educators can better address the unique educational requirements of DLLs. Teacher-training programs have been identified as a key driver in boosting educational attainment among DLLs and promoting active family involvement in the learning process.

Moreover, research sheds light on the specific challenges encountered by Latino immigrant students within the educational sphere. These challenges underscore the importance of implementing tailored teaching methodologies that cater to the needs of this student demographic. By adopting inclusive and culturally responsive approaches, educators can create an environment that supports the academic growth and development of Latino immigrant students.

In conclusion, the education of dual language learners from bilingual immigrant families necessitates a collaborative effort involving educators, families, and the broader community. Family engagement serves as a cornerstone in enhancing student success and fostering a supportive learning environment. Through strategic partnerships and targeted interventions, the educational system can address the unique needs of DLLs and empower them to achieve academic excellence despite the obstacles they may face.
