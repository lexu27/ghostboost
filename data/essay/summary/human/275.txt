Mahatma Gandhi, popularly known as Bapu, was a key figure in India's struggle for independence, employing non-violent methods like fasting to pressure the British to exit the country. His commitment to non-violence and moral principles has drawn parallels to Aristotle's philosophy on morality and societal harmony. Despite efforts to uphold Gandhi's moral standards, concerns persist regarding the misinterpretation of his teachings in social, economic, and political contexts. 

Gandhi's ethics encompass a wide array of topics spanning politics, parenting, integrity, social conduct, and the strategic use of fasting as a means of protest. His stance on fasting highlights the necessity of comprehending the purpose behind fasting and its impact on society at large. Moreover, Gandhi's ethical beliefs relating to the judiciary underscore the need for impartiality towards all individuals irrespective of their social standing, a facet he perceives as lacking in India's legal system.

In terms of parenting, Gandhi emphasizes the significance of balancing children's liberty with maintaining moral authority as a parent. He stresses the need for nurturing disciplined and responsible individuals through a delicate interplay of freedom and guidance. Moreover, Gandhi's moral framework rejects the idea of retribution in politics and emphasizes the primacy of non-violent actions in fostering peace and ethical conduct.

Gandhi's ethical standpoint on inter-religious relations calls for a belief system that values humanity and fosters mutual respect and understanding among diverse religious groups. His advocacy for harmonious coexistence underlines the importance of appreciating and celebrating religious diversity while transcending divisive boundaries.

It is imperative to delve into Gandhi's moral legacy to preserve his values and advocate for peaceful cohabitation among varied religious communities. By studying his enduring influence, societies can glean valuable insights on how to navigate complex socio-political landscapes with grace, compassion, and unwavering adherence to ethical principles. Gandhi's enduring relevance lies in his timeless teachings on non-violence, morality, and the profound impact of individual actions on the collective conscience of society.
