The concept of social equality has been intricately intertwined with the tendency to overlook ethnic distinctions, a phenomenon that has unfortunately fueled the rise of white supremacy. In the United States, the notion of celebrating equality has frequently translated into conforming to a Caucasian male prototype, placing immense pressure on minorities to relinquish their own identities in exchange for societal approval. Notably, Japanese Americans have been assimilated into the framework of the model minority, further perpetuating this cycle of assimilation. However, true equality necessitates the ability to express one's cultural heritage without fear of marginalization. Encouraging a genuine curiosity in diverse cultures not only fosters evolution but also encourages critical thinking among individuals. Discrimination has played a grim role in erasing the historical narratives of numerous ethnic minorities, emphasizing the importance of promoting cultural diversity studies that prioritize shared learning and the identification of common ground, all while combating discrimination and prejudice. By embracing cultural differences and fostering mutual respect, societies can aspire towards a future where equality is synonymous with inclusivity and understanding.
