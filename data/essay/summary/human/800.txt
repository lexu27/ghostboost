The study delved into the intricate relationship between alcohol consumption and neighborhood characteristics among students using multiple linear regression analysis. The dependent variable, alcohol consumption among students, was scrutinized against five independent variables including crime rates, neighborhood cohesion, drug activity, sense of safety, and trust levels in the neighborhood. The results revealed an R-squared value of 0.026, indicating that merely 2.6% of the variation in alcohol consumption could be elucidated by the independent variables. Furthermore, the adjusted R-squared value of 0.003 underscored the limited explanatory power attributed to the multitude of variables considered and the sample size.

In table 2.0, the p-value of 0.342 from the regression analysis was unveiled, signifying a lack of significance in elucidating alcohol consumption trends. Correlation analyses unveiled weak positive correlations between safety, crime rates, and neighborhood cohesion with alcohol consumption, while drug activity and trust exhibited weak negative correlations. The coefficients table provided insights into the standardized coefficients and significance levels of the independent variables, offering a comprehensive view of their impact on alcohol consumption patterns.

Overall, the study shed light on the nuanced interplay between alcohol consumption and neighborhood dynamics among students. Despite the meticulous analysis conducted through multiple linear regression, the findings suggested a modest explanatory power of the selected independent variables. The research outcomes underscored the intricate nature of the factors influencing alcohol consumption habits among students, hinting at the need for further exploration and potentially refined methodologies to deepen our understanding of this complex relationship.

In conclusion, the study's findings provided valuable insights into the role of neighborhood characteristics in shaping alcohol consumption behaviors among students. Through a rigorous analytical approach and comprehensive data interpretation, the research contributed to the existing body of knowledge in this domain, paving the way for future investigations and interventions aimed at promoting healthier lifestyle choices among student populations.
