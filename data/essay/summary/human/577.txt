Sociology plays a crucial role in understanding the complex relationship between race and health disparities. By redefining race to encompass relevant aspects and highlighting stratifying principles like socioeconomic disadvantages and discrimination, sociology provides a framework for comprehending these disparities. Despite race being acknowledged as a social construct, its construction is often influenced by physical anthropology and genetic inheritance.

A sociological perspective on race and health disparities reveals socioeconomic factors as pivotal social determinants of health. This approach enhances our comprehension of the causal links involved. Moreover, sociology sheds light on the environmental context of health, including access to opportunities for a healthier lifestyle and diet.

Kwate's (2008) study exemplifies how sociology delves into issues such as residential segregation and fast food density to elucidate why fast food outlets are more prevalent in segregated black neighborhoods. This analysis redirects attention from simplistic assumptions about food preferences linked to race towards structural factors that underpin race and health inequalities.

By emphasizing actual structural factors, sociology facilitates a more profound exploration of the intricate interplay between race and health disparities. This broader perspective enables a comprehensive understanding of the complexities involved in addressing these disparities and emphasizes the importance of tackling underlying social determinants to achieve health equity.
