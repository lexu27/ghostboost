In today's increasingly multicultural societies, the medical field is experiencing a shift towards embracing diversity in patient populations. This shift has highlighted the importance of intercultural communication in healthcare settings where discussions on crucial topics like medicine and life-saving interventions take place. The significance of effective doctor-patient interaction cannot be overstated as it directly impacts patient satisfaction, adherence to medical recommendations, and overall health outcomes. Conversely, neglecting to address socio-cultural differences can lead to patient discontent, non-compliance with treatment plans, and detrimental health consequences. Therefore, healthcare providers must prioritize and enhance their intercultural communication skills to provide inclusive and effective care to patients from diverse backgrounds.
