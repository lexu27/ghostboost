Corey's ethical decision-making model serves as a valuable framework in analyzing ethical dilemmas in various scenarios. This model involves several key steps, including problem description and identification, legal information and advice collection, and decision-making processes. By applying this model to real-life cases, individuals can navigate complex ethical issues more effectively.

In the first case study discussed, a company is faced with suspicions regarding an employee's drug abuse and dishonest behavior. This situation raises concerns about privacy rights and ethical testing practices. To address this dilemma, it is crucial to gather relevant legal information by reviewing ethics codes, seeking advice from experts, and considering applicable laws. Subsequently, decision-making options such as assisting the client in legal action against the company, recommending therapy, or providing psychological support are presented.

Moving on to the second case, it involves a mental health professional who lacks competence in career development, posing risks to clients due to boundary violations and potential harm. Legal standards and laws related to this case encompass boundaries of competence, proper assessment procedures, and protocols for reporting ethical breaches. Resolving this scenario requires reaching out to the colleague regarding their unethical conduct and potentially involving professional ethics communities for further guidance.

The choice between informal and formal resolution methods hinges on the colleague's response to the concerns raised. By following Corey's ethical decision-making model, individuals can systematically address ethical quandaries, weighing legal considerations, gathering advice, and exploring decision alternatives. This structured approach ensures that ethical dilemmas are tackled with thoroughness and care, promoting integrity and accountability in professional practices.
