Electronic health record (EHR) systems and healthcare data tools play a crucial role in enhancing nursing practice and improving patient outcomes. By implementing relevant policies that focus on drug administration, nursing care can be significantly enhanced. However, the integration of evidence-based practice (EBP) elements into EHR faces various barriers such as lack of prioritization, organizational structure issues, and limited nurse involvement.

Current EHR systems have their limitations, including copy and paste errors that can hinder the application of EBP principles, especially in drug administration. To overcome these challenges, it is essential to optimize EHR systems to improve workflows, promote interprofessional care, and increase patient satisfaction. Nursing professionals are encouraged to utilize EHR specifically for drug-related practices to advance EBP principles effectively.

Despite the benefits of integrating EBP into EHR, there are persistent barriers such as prioritization challenges, governance issues, and insufficient nurse involvement. A proposed policy solution involves making functional EHR improvements tailored towards drug administration while actively involving nursing professionals in the system changes. By addressing these barriers and focusing on enhancing EHR functionalities related to drug administration, nursing practice can be further improved, ultimately leading to better patient care outcomes.
