Blood transfusion has a rich history dating back to ancient civilizations, where it was believed to have rejuvenating effects. Over time, the development of blood donation faced various challenges, transitioning from deification to facing state bans. Early attempts at intravenous injections posed difficulties, utilizing primitive tools such as bird feathers and animal bladders.

The exotic and risky nature of blood transfusion in the past stemmed from unknown factors influencing its success. However, significant technological advancements in the last century, particularly in blood storage and freezing methods, propelled the research and application of blood transfusion. Notably, the establishment of the world's first blood bank in Leningrad in 1932 was a pivotal moment in the history of blood transfusion.

Blood transfusion evolved into a universal treatment method, advocated for its diverse health benefits until the onset of the AIDS epidemic in the mid-80s altered public perceptions. The crisis prompted a reevaluation of safety protocols and screening measures within the blood service sector. Today, the focus lies on ensuring the quality, safety, and availability of transfusion care through automation, state-of-the-art equipment, and continuous quality management enhancements. This commitment reflects the ongoing efforts to uphold the highest standards in blood transfusion services, safeguarding both donors and recipients alike.
