End-Stage Renal Failure (ESRF) is a critical medical condition characterized by the progressive loss of nephrons in the kidneys, leading to a decline in renal function and giving rise to a myriad of complications throughout the body. This condition is witnessing a surge in global prevalence, accompanied by elevated mortality rates and frequently co-occurring comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, and malignancies.

ESRF exerts its detrimental effects on the urinary system, resulting in ineffective waste elimination and potential central nervous system alterations like sleep disturbances and difficulties with focus and concentration. To denote different aspects of ESRF concerning the kidneys, blood, disease, and pathology, prefixes like nephro-, hemato-, patho-, and reno- can be utilized. Furthermore, in describing various facets of ESRF, suffixes such as -al, -ic, -in, -ism, and -osis can be affixed to terms, elucidating connections to the kidney, the condition itself, and the abnormal physiological states of the kidneys and other bodily systems.

In the realm of ESRF terminology, combining forms play a crucial role in articulating kidney-related conditions and processes. Terms like renal, nephric, nephritic, nephrosis, nephrogenic, and renogenic are instrumental in describing the intricacies of kidney dysfunction within the context of ESRF. The multifaceted nature of ESRF manifests in an array of complications including reduced hemoglobin levels, hypertension, myocarditis, pericarditis, congestive heart failure, convulsions, skin sensitivity, anemia, and gastrointestinal disturbances.

Individuals grappling with ESRF may experience a spectrum of symptoms ranging from fatigue, dry mouth, weight loss, alterations in skin pigmentation, to skin irritations. The amalgamation of these symptoms and complications underscores the gravity of ESRF and the imperative need for comprehensive management strategies to mitigate its impact on patients' health and well-being.
