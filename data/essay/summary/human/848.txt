Race plays a crucial role in the history and culture of the United States and Canada, profoundly influencing the experiences of Black individuals. In Canada, the policy of multiculturalism has paved the way for the adoption of Black History Month, echoing its origins in the United States and observed in February annually. This dedicated month in Canada serves as a platform to enhance education on diversity and the African heritage within school curricula.

However, simply confining the acknowledgment of Black history to a single month is deemed inadequate by Prince (2009). Prince advocates for a holistic approach, emphasizing the necessity of embedding Black perspectives into the curriculum all year round. The prevalent practice of isolating Black history into a specific timeframe perpetuates a dominant ideology that erases the significance of Black contributions and existence.

Prince underscores the critical need for an inclusive curriculum that extends beyond mere tokenism, highlighting that it is imperative to deconstruct damaging stereotypes and foster a more profound comprehension of historical truths. By integrating a comprehensive study of global history into regular academic syllabi, all students, particularly Black children, can feel validated and represented. Embracing a curriculum that incorporates diverse narratives is not a luxury but a fundamental requirement in reshaping perceptions and fostering a more inclusive society.
