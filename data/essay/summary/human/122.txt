Euthanasia, a highly debated topic, revolves around the ethical discussions concerning the deliberate ending of a person's life to alleviate their suffering. Advocates of euthanasia often advocate for an individual's right to autonomy and self-determination, believing that one should have the choice to end their life on their terms. On the other hand, opponents of euthanasia often equate it to murder, emphasizing the sanctity of life and the moral duty to preserve it at all costs.

Ethical theories such as teleology, deontology, and Emmanuel Levinas's "face of the other" present differing perspectives on euthanasia. Teleology, stemming from Aristotle's philosophy, posits that the ultimate aim of life is happiness, suggesting that euthanasia contradicts this principle by prematurely ending life and obstructing the pursuit of happiness. In contrast, deontology, influenced by Immanuel Kant, underscores moral duties and asserts that actions like euthanasia, involving the deliberate termination of life, are inherently immoral regardless of the consequences they may bring.

Levinas's theory accentuates the relational responsibility individuals have towards each other, considering euthanasia as a violation of one's obligation to respect the existence and dignity of others. Through the lens of these ethical frameworks, euthanasia is often viewed as unethical due to the emphasis on the value of life and the fundamental moral principles that guide human behavior.

Aristotle, Kant, and Levinas all contribute to the discourse on euthanasia from unique philosophical standpoints, collectively arguing against its ethicality. While Aristotle highlights the pursuit of happiness as a core aspect of ethical living, Kant emphasizes the importance of moral duties and universal principles that condemn acts like euthanasia. Levinas brings forth the ethical imperative of recognizing and honoring the existence of others, portraying euthanasia as a transgression against this fundamental ethical obligation.

In conclusion, the ethical debates surrounding euthanasia remain intricate and contentious, with various ethical theories converging to question its moral justifiability. The clash between the right to self-determination and the sanctity of life underscores the complexity of euthanasia as a moral dilemma that challenges societal norms and ethical boundaries.
