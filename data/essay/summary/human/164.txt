Sociology serves as a pivotal tool in categorizing social strata based on various factors such as race, age, education, and socioeconomic status, with a contemporary emphasis on the latter. The study of social strata concerning race and its intersection with healthcare is particularly crucial in addressing the needs of society. By delving into the causes of social phenomena, especially inequality, sociologists can uncover correlations that form the foundation for developing charts reflecting statistical and demographic trends. These charts are instrumental in making sociological forecasts, including those related to public health.

Education emerges as a significant determinant of future health outcomes, with studies showcasing correlations between the level and type of education received and health conditions. For instance, the relationship between education in programming versus music and future health issues highlights the impact of educational specializations on an individual's societal role, available resources, and susceptibility to specific diseases in the future. Moreover, research reveals a higher prevalence of certain forms of cancer among individuals in low socioeconomic strata, underscoring the importance of early detection and access to treatment.

The influence of socioeconomic status, education, and living environment on health outcomes cannot be overstated, with environmental factors gaining prominence in socioeconomic research and health considerations. As sociological studies continue to explore the intricate web of connections between social strata and health, it becomes increasingly evident that addressing disparities in education, income, and environmental conditions is essential for improving overall health outcomes and promoting societal well-being.
