Olivier Armantier's et al. article, "How Economic Crises Affect Inflation Beliefs: Evidence from the COVID-19 Pandemic," published in the Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization, delves into the shifts in inflation perceptions over the initial six months of the COVID-19 crisis. The study investigates the repercussions of inflationary crises, juxtaposing them with prior crises to gauge the severity of the current situation.

Despite overall subdued average inflation expectations, the research reveals a notable divergence of opinions, particularly in the near future. A significant segment of households, especially those with higher levels of education, initially anticipated low inflation or even deflation as a result of the pandemic. Armantier and his team underpin their observations with a variety of graphs and tables integrated into the article.

The focus of Armantier et al.'s study lies in atypically triggered crises and household reactions, drawing parallels with historical crises to comprehend the economic ramifications better. The research underscores a sharp disparity in inflation perceptions and underscores distinctions across demographic segments. Furthermore, the authors dissect how misconceptions about inflation can propagate the crisis to other economic domains, drawing parallels to events such as the Great Recession.
