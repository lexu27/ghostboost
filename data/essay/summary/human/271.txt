The United Arab Emirates (UAE) operates under a constitution that significantly limits press freedom, earning low global rankings in this regard. Despite efforts by organizations like the UDHR and MoFAIC to advance press freedom, there remain pervasive restrictions such as judicial harassment and censorship, indicating a substantial gap in the system. Rather than fostering journalistic independence, the UAE's constraints on freedom of expression primarily serve to control media narratives and safeguard the regime's interests. This is further evidenced by cases of oppression against journalists, like the incarceration of a sports reporter for covering a match, underscoring the oppressive environment for media professionals in the country.

While the UAE constitution ostensibly guarantees freedom of expression within legal boundaries, laws concerning defamation and public order create ambiguity regarding what constitutes acceptable expression. Such legal provisions are often used to justify censorship and regulate opinions, enabling the government to monopolize information dissemination for political purposes. Criticism of the government or its associates is outlawed under stringent regulations like Federal Law Code no. 15 of 1980, perpetuating censorship and intimidation tactics to uphold authority.

The concept of restricted freedom of expression in the press raises questions about its role in serving the interests of governing entities by managing the flow of information and promoting societal tranquility through the suppression of unfavorable content. Laws such as federal law no. 3, revised in 1987, explicitly forbid the publication of information about rulers without their permission, leaving citizens uninformed and ostensibly contributing to peacekeeping efforts. However, the prevalence of censorship and legal threats against journalists restrict the portrayal of individuals in a critical light, prompting doubts about the constitution's true purpose of prioritizing governmental protection over the rights of the populace. In essence, the UAE's media landscape reflects a complex interplay between legal frameworks, political objectives, and the fundamental rights of freedom of expression and information dissemination.
