The evolution of technology has revolutionized the way businesses operate, pushing them towards online platforms to enhance their market reach. Traditional methods of advertising through legacy media, such as billboards and TV commercials, are gradually losing their effectiveness in comparison to the dynamic world of new media. Legacy media promotions, though once popular for targeting broad audiences, now struggle to engage effectively with consumers, leading to reduced excitement and sales for products. In contrast, new media strategies are more aligned with modern society, particularly resonating with Generation Z through engaging platforms like YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok. Companies are leveraging the power of social media influencers to promote their products efficiently, recognizing that influencer partnerships yield higher returns than conventional legacy media approaches. The sway that online personalities hold over consumer behavior is evident as people are more inclined to purchase products endorsed by their favorite influencers, be it bloggers, models, actors, or celebrities. In today's digital landscape, the role of social media influencers is pivotal in driving online product sales, showcasing the significant shift from traditional advertising methods to the influencer-driven marketing era.
