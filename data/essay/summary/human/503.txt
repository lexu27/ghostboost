Palliative care (PC) policies play a crucial role in determining the quality and effectiveness of end-of-life care provided to patients. In the case of Intermountain Healthcare (IH), the current PC policy has been criticized for its lack of specific instructions, leading to inefficiencies in care provision and the possibility of neglecting certain essential aspects of care. This deficiency in a comprehensive PC policy results in a varied approach to caring for terminal patients, potentially resulting in substandard service delivery. Scholars emphasize the importance of detailed PC policies to enhance patient care quality and ensure equitable access to services.

Nurses at IH may face challenges in prioritizing certain aspects of care due to unclear guidelines, which can result in issues in care provision and affect the overall quality of care for patients. The absence of a universal, comprehensive PC policy creates room for bias in care provision, impacting the quality of end-of-life care received by patients. The COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated these challenges by highlighting resource shortages and nursing burnout, ultimately affecting the quality of PC offered at IH.

Policy changes not only impact nursing staff but also the inpatient population at IH facilities. Demographics affected by these changes include nursing staff who require clear guidance on their responsibilities and expectations, as well as the patients relying on palliative care services. Inadequate PC policies can have a significant impact on mortality rates, underscoring the urgency for improved approaches to specialist palliative care.

Moreover, disparities in access to care stem from the current policy's reliance on individual care plans, potentially leading to underperformance and limitations in service approval. The proposed policy change seeks to address these issues by advocating for a comprehensive transformation of the current system. This transformation aims to take into account cultural influences and assess the stakeholders' readiness for change to ensure the successful implementation of the new policy.

In conclusion, the shortcomings in the current palliative care policy at Intermountain Healthcare highlight the critical need for a more robust and detailed approach to care provision. By implementing a comprehensive PC policy that addresses existing gaps, considers cultural factors, and involves stakeholders in the process, IH can enhance the quality of end-of-life care, reduce disparities in access to services, and ultimately improve patient outcomes.
