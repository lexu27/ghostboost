The agricultural sector is largely controlled by powerful corporations that wield significant influence over policies and regulations. This stronghold has resulted in detrimental environmental consequences, violations of human rights, and persistent poverty challenges. While consumer behaviors play a role in fostering industry diversity, addressing these issues requires more than just a shift in buying habits. The continuous evolution of technology has propelled the growth of the agricultural industry, leading to an upsurge in supply and market expansion. Companies often prioritize immediate profits by selling crops before cultivation, showing scant regard for the repercussions on the environment and society. Transformations in food retail practices impact consumer preferences and product availability, especially in both developed and developing nations. The size of food retail entities plays a crucial role in shaping consumer decisions and determining supplier choices, ultimately contributing to market monopolization. The existing dominance of large corporations in the market overlooks critical issues within contemporary agricultural processes.Efforts to address these systemic challenges require a multifaceted approach that encompasses regulatory reforms, consumer education, and sustainable agricultural practices. By fostering greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity within the agricultural sector, it is possible to mitigate the adverse impacts of market monopolization and promote a more equitable and environmentally sustainable food system.
