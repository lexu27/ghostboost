Ellis Island and Angel Island both hold significant places in American history as immigration stations that processed millions of immigrants between 1880 and 1930. Ellis Island, the larger and busier of the two, primarily catered to European immigrants and imposed stringent regulations, especially on women and children seeking entry into the United States. Officials at Ellis Island conducted meticulous inspections, going as far as separating children from their parents if there were doubts about their relationship.

On the other hand, Angel Island, often referred to as the "Ellis Island of the West," provided a different experience, particularly for Chinese immigrants due to the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. Immigrants arriving at Angel Island were subjected to detention, quarantine, interrogation, and even deportation, amidst overcrowded and unsanitary living conditions. Despite the hardships, Chinese immigrants expressed their deepest fears and highest hopes by inscribing poignant poems on the walls of the barracks.

The treatment of immigrants at both Ellis Island and Angel Island was significantly influenced by their countries of origin and the prevailing laws. The stark contrast between the two facilities is evident in the extensive interrogations conducted at Angel Island to verify familial relationships, leading to the emergence of the "Paper Sons and Daughters" phenomenon.

In essence, Ellis Island and Angel Island stand as testaments to the diverse experiences encountered by immigrants seeking new beginnings in America. While Ellis Island symbolizes the struggles and aspirations of European immigrants navigating through its gates, Angel Island represents the harsh realities faced by Chinese immigrants in a climate of exclusion and discrimination. The stories etched within the walls of these immigration stations continue to serve as poignant reminders of the complexities and disparities in the treatment of immigrants based on their nationality and the laws of the time.
