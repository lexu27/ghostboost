Maintaining good health through balanced diets is crucial for the well-being of pregnant mothers and their unborn babies. The antepartum period, which occurs just before childbirth, plays a vital role in ensuring that mothers consume nutritious foods to support the child's development and delivery process. Nutrition is a significant factor in successful child delivery as it provides essential nutrients needed by both the mother and the child.

However, various factors such as income levels, awareness about proper nutrition, and previous illness history can contribute to malnutrition among pregnant women. It is important to address these issues to promote healthier outcomes during pregnancy. Risk factors during pregnancy can include age, cultural practices, lifestyle choices, socio-economic status, and dietary complications, all of which can affect the overall health of the mother and the child.

Teenage pregnancy, in particular, is associated with poor eating habits and a higher risk of nutritional deficiencies. Teenagers may find it challenging to adhere to a balanced diet, which can result in risks such as low birth weight and premature delivery. It is crucial to provide adequate support and education to pregnant teenagers to ensure they are receiving the necessary nutrients for optimal health.

Nutrients play a critical role in the development of both the mother's body and the growing baby. Deficiencies in essential nutrients can have significant impacts on the health of both the mother and the baby. Therefore, it is essential for pregnant women, especially teenagers, to pay close attention to their diets and ensure they are meeting their nutritional needs to support a healthy pregnancy and childbirth.
