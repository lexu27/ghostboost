American slavery in the United States was not just a system of forced labor but evolved into a distinct socio-economic and political structure within capitalism. The exploitation of labor led to a movement against the unethical ownership of individuals, culminating in the Civil War and the Thirteenth Amendment in 1865, officially abolishing slavery and deeming it unconstitutional. Despite this legal victory for freedom, former slaves found themselves in a precarious position as they remained reliant on the state and their previous owners for support post-emancipation. 

The transition to freedom was fraught with challenges as ex-slaves grappled with limited documentation, financial resources, and societal acceptance. The absence of essential resources impeded their integration into society, perpetuating discrimination and exclusion. While the end of slavery was a significant milestone, it did not guarantee equality or justice for those who had been enslaved for generations.

The history of American slavery is now regarded as a dark and shameful period, sparking debates on whether reparations should have been provided to address the lasting impacts of slavery on individuals and communities. Even after emancipation, the struggle for survival persisted for many ex-slaves due to the lack of necessary means for livelihood. Social attitudes and disparities in resource distribution further hindered their full participation in society, highlighting the systemic barriers that persisted post-emancipation.

The dependence on external assistance for sustenance underscored the harsh reality that the newly liberated slaves were not entirely free in a society that still grappled with deep-rooted prejudices and inequities. The legacy of American slavery continues to shape discussions on race, equality, and justice in the United States, emphasizing the importance of acknowledging past injustices and working towards a more inclusive and equitable society.
