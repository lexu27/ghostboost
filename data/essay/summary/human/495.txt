Pressure ulcers, also known as bedsores, are a common issue affecting immobile patients and the elderly due to prolonged pressure on the skin. In the United States, nearly 3 million adults suffer from pressure ulcers, leading to increased healthcare costs and severe health complications if left untreated. These ulcers can develop both in hospital settings and during homecare, with housebound adults being particularly vulnerable due to the lack of regular nursing care.

To combat the development and progression of pressure ulcers, the use of pressure-reducing surfaces has been identified as an effective solution. These surfaces, such as pillows, specialized mattresses, overlays, and more complex devices, are categorized into three main groups based on their level of complexity. Group 1 consists of specialized mattresses and overlays, Group 2 includes advanced devices like air flotation beds, while Group 3 comprises complete bed systems such as air-fluidized beds.

The primary goal of these pressure-reducing support surfaces is to limit tissue pressure, enhance circulation, and promote healing by distributing pressure evenly across larger body areas. By reducing pressure points and minimizing tissue deformation, these support surfaces play a crucial role in preventing the occurrence of pressure ulcers and aiding in their treatment.

Moreover, active and reactive support surfaces have been acknowledged for their effectiveness in both preventing and managing pressure ulcers. Active support surfaces adjust automatically to the individual's body shape and movements, providing continuous pressure relief. On the other hand, reactive support surfaces respond to changes in pressure and adjust accordingly to maintain optimal support.

In conclusion, pressure ulcers pose a significant health risk, particularly for immobile individuals and the elderly. To address this issue, the utilization of pressure-reducing support surfaces, categorized into different groups based on complexity, has shown promise in preventing and treating pressure ulcers by improving circulation, reducing pressure points, and promoting healing. Active and reactive support surfaces further enhance the effectiveness of these interventions, emphasizing the importance of comprehensive care and management strategies in combating pressure ulcers.
