Nike, a globally renowned brand, has recently been under scrutiny due to its corrupt corporate culture that predominantly suppresses women within the organization. To tackle this issue, four potential approaches have been suggested: absolving, solving, resolving, and dissolving. However, the most viable solution for Nike's long-term objectives would be to dissolve the existing structure completely.

Dissolution, in this context, refers to the eradication of the underlying causes that have perpetuated the problem within Nike's corporate culture. To effectively address issues such as harassment and corruption, Nike must undergo a complete transformation from its top leadership to the grassroots level. The implementation of policies that disincentivize negative behaviors is crucial in reshaping the organization's values and norms.

A proposed plan to combat the issue involves a thorough evaluation of all employees and managers to identify complicity in maintaining the toxic culture. Those found to be involved in such practices should be promptly removed to set a precedent for a zero-tolerance approach towards misconduct. 

Furthermore, the new leadership at Nike should strive to establish a culture that champions equality, capability, and diversity. By fostering an inclusive environment where every individual is valued and respected, Nike can rebuild its tarnished reputation and regain trust from both its employees and customers.

In conclusion, the transformation of Nike's corporate culture is imperative to address the prevalent issues of gender suppression and corruption. By dissolving the existing structure and re-establishing a culture based on integrity and equality, Nike can pave the way for a more sustainable and ethical future.
