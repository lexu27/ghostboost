In Texas, the consequences for a Registered Nurse (RN) charged with Driving While Intoxicated (DWI) are stringent. One of the key repercussions is the obligation to fulfill annual renewal form requirements within nine months. The Texas Board of Nursing (TBON) plays a crucial role in evaluating complaints regarding a nurse's ability to practice safely, with varying degrees of involvement depending on the circumstances. TBON takes a progressive stance on substance use disorders, recognizing them as treatable conditions. Nurses who demonstrate stable recovery are sometimes permitted to continue caring for patients in specific cases, guided by Tex. Occ. Code 301.4521.

When assessing incidents involving substance abuse, TBON carefully considers the specifics of each case. Depending on the situation, TBON may mandate drug testing, recommendations for treatment, professional assessments, and participation in peer support programs. For repeat offenses, especially concerning substance abuse, nurses may face probation and restrictions on their licenses. 

Furthermore, RNs relocating to Texas with prior convictions undergo thorough scrutiny by the nursing board, particularly for serious offenses such as felonies involving significant monetary fraud. In such instances, the approval of the nurse's license may be granted with conditions attached, such as limitations on working with certain patient populations. TBON's approach aims to uphold the highest standards of patient care and safety while offering support and opportunities for rehabilitation to nurses facing challenges with substance abuse or legal issues.
