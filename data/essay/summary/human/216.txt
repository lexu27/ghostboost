Marketing, as defined by the American Marketing Association (AMA), encompasses a wide array of activities aimed at creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging offerings that are valued by customers, clients, partners, and society at large. The dynamic nature of marketing is evident in its responsiveness to consumers' demands, which not only shape various marketing strategies but are also influenced by the freedom of choice that consumers wield in the marketplace. This intricate interplay between customer preferences and marketing efforts underscores the complexity and importance of understanding and adapting to consumer needs in the ever-evolving field of marketing.
