Tribal sovereignty has been a longstanding issue, with tribes experiencing a spectrum of treatment ranging from support to persecution. The law concerning tribal gaming is widely seen as a positive development in acknowledging tribes' distinct way of life and self-governance. The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act affords tribes the autonomy to select their gaming pursuits, often revolving around tribal customs or games of chance.

The allowance for tribes to conduct their own gaming activities is crucial in preserving their heritage and asserting sovereignty in the realm of entertainment. These gaming practices not only support traditions and rituals that hold cultural significance for tribes but also aid in delineating areas of life under tribal authority, serving as a reminder of one's heritage and advocating for freedom of choice.

Traditional tribal gaming holds a pivotal role that predominantly remains within the jurisdiction of tribes. These gaming endeavors contribute to upholding tribal identity and sovereignty, providing a platform through which tribal communities can express their cultural practices and exercise control over their recreational activities. Ultimately, gaming activities play a significant role in sustaining tribal traditions and reinforcing the autonomy and integrity of tribal nations.
