In the novel "Drive Your Plow over the Bones of the Dead," Janina employs a distinctive language style by assigning nicknames to characters and animals, a practice that not only unveils her personality but also plays a key role in unraveling mysteries. She holds a strong belief in the significance of names, considering them to be "polyonymous" and consequently bestows names upon individuals based on her own unique perceptions of them.

Through Janina's naming process, each character becomes embodied by the traits she associates with them, such as labeling a friend as Oddball or using descriptors like Big Foot and Commandant for the murder victims. This naming ritual reflects Janina's profound contemplation of the core essence of each individual, exemplified by her choice of the name Marysia for a rescued dog, a decision influenced by the animal's history and condition.

Moreover, the juxtaposition of names given to people versus animals sheds light on Janina's values. While she scrutinizes humans for their idiosyncrasies, she holds animals in higher esteem. This distinction underscores Janina's inclination towards prioritizing and evaluating beings based on their treatment, displaying a tendency to favor the salvation of animals over that of humans.

Despite being characterized as an unreliable narrator, Janina's selection of names provides subtle clues about her perspectives on the murders and potentially hints at her involvement in them. Her unconventional naming approach not only functions as a narrative device but also serves as a window into her moral compass, emphasizing her profound love for animals and her critical judgment of human behavior. Janina's intricate web of names thus stands as a poignant reflection of her nuanced nature, offering insights into her values and worldview.
