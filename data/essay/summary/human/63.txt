The relationship between capitalist society and cultural products that perpetuate capitalist values is a concept explored by Theodor Adorno. Adorno posited that media, such as films and books, significantly contribute to fostering and reinforcing beliefs in capitalist ideologies. This perspective aligns with Adorno's critique of industrial culture, where mass media narratives often equate wealth with happiness, subtly endorsing consumerist ideals.

Contrastingly, the structural functionalism theory presents society as a complex organism with interconnected parts working together for the overall functioning and stability of the whole. Within this framework, the children's entertainment industry plays a crucial role in educating and shaping emotional development among young individuals. Unlike Adorno's emphasis on profit-driven motives in industrial culture, structural functionalism views children's entertainment as a means of societal cohesion and growth.

The juxtaposition of Adorno's industrial culture theory and structural functionalism becomes particularly evident when examining modern cultural industries. In industrial culture, children's entertainment tends to prioritize commercial aspects, using media characters to promote merchandise sales and generate profits. Disney, a prominent example, strategically leverages cartoon characters to entice children to their theme parks, ultimately aiming for financial gains.

While both concepts share an underlying focus on societal stability, their divergent approaches to cultural production underscore the complexities within contemporary cultural landscapes. Adorno's critical perspective sheds light on how media can shape perceptions and reinforce capitalist values, while structural functionalism underscores the multifaceted roles of cultural products in fostering education and emotional development among younger audiences. In essence, these contrasting viewpoints offer valuable insights into the intricate relationship between culture, society, and economic structures.
