The lack of affordable and accessible dental care is a significant issue faced by many seniors, as highlighted by the author's 73-year-old dad. Dental problems among the elderly are prevalent, often manifested through mouth pain caused by severe cavities affecting teeth nerves and blood vessels. Medicare, established in 1965, falls short in covering routine dental care, preventive services, and restorative procedures, leaving seniors with substantial out-of-pocket expenses.

President Biden's proposed Medicare expansion seeks to incorporate dental, hearing, and vision coverage. However, the lack of progress in its implementation raises uncertainties. The high costs of dental care act as a barrier, preventing many seniors from seeking essential treatment, thereby leading to deteriorating oral health. Consequently, the absence of dental coverage in Medicare results in numerous emergency room visits for dental issues, primarily due to abscesses and caries.

It is crucial to underscore the significance of including dental coverage in Medicare for both oral and overall health benefits for seniors. Expanding Medicaid coverage for dental services could mitigate cost barriers and enhance access to care for low-income Medicare beneficiaries. The nation is confronted with an urgent need to tackle the inaccessibility of dental care for seniors and urgently implement solutions to prevent escalating oral health problems.

Failure to enact policy changes and implement solutions may result in a surge in emergency room visits for dental issues among the aging population, consequently impacting overall healthcare costs. Thus, addressing the affordability and accessibility of dental care for seniors is imperative to ensure their well-being and overall quality of life.
