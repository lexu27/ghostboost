The Mongol Empire, under leaders like Genghis Khan and Hulagu, rose to power through territorial expansion, instilling fear in those who dared to resist their rule. Hulagu, known for his brutality, employed tactics like negotiations and instructions to ensure submission, as seen in his actions in Baghdad where he depopulated the city due to neglected military reinforcement. When dealing with powerful states such as Afghanistan and Turkestan, Genghis Khan and Hulagu implemented strategic approaches to maintain dominance.

A stark contrast emerges between the treatment of rulers under different Mongol leaders. Kublai Khan's interaction with the Southern China Empress stands in sharp contrast to Hulagu's ruthless massacre during the fall of the Abbasid Empire. The invasion of Southern China by Chinson Bayan led to the downfall of the Song Emperor, showcasing the widespread impact of Mongol conquests.

Hulagu's campaign was marked by the destruction of houses of learning and the massacre of countless individuals, including the Abbasid Caliph. His infamous methods, like rolling the caliph in a carpet and riding horses over him, highlight the extreme brutality employed to instill terror and assert dominance. The Mongol legacy is one of conquest and destruction, leaving a trail of pain and suffering for those who resisted their rule.
