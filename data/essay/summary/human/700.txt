A study focusing on American citizens aged 18 and above from all states including the District of Columbia involved a sample of 1038 individuals selected randomly for research. The selection process included both landline and cellphone numbers, ensuring a minimum of 400 cellphone and 600 landline respondents per 1000 national adults. Interviews conducted in December 2012, between December 19 and December 22, were carried out via both phone types, with some conversations held in Spanish. Data analysis relied on information collected during the survey and official reports from 2011, with design effects factored in to calculate the margin of error and account for potential inaccuracies in survey outcomes. The experimental setup of the study involved daily administration of ant venom capsules over a week as the explanatory variable, while measuring the resulting swelling in arthritis sufferers as the response variable.
