The outbreak of the Second World War was anticipated by both contemporary individuals and those living in the 1930s. Despite this foreseen inevitability, the United States of America found itself unable to avert the war due to its commitment to an isolationist foreign policy. The economic hardships experienced worldwide during the 1930s further complicated America's ability to intervene in European affairs. The foundation for the new war was laid out by the dissatisfaction stemming from the Treaty of Versailles and among various stakeholders.

Germany's strategic resource buildup and alliances with authoritarian regimes played a significant role in triggering the war. The prevailing political regimes in Europe, such as the totalitarian systems in the communist USSR, Nazi Germany, and fascist Italy, created a volatile environment ripe for military conflicts that could escalate into a global war. Even if the USA had abandoned its isolationist stance, it is unlikely that it could have prevented the outbreak of the Second World War.

However, the United States played a crucial role in bringing the war to a conclusion and establishing a new world order post-conflict. Despite its initial inability to prevent the war, America's contributions to ending the conflict and shaping the post-war landscape were instrumental in shaping the course of history.
