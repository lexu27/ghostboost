Social media has become a fundamental aspect of contemporary society, providing a platform for individuals to connect and engage with others. Among the various social media platforms available, Facebook stands out as a popular choice due to its relatively lower amount of spam and advertisements compared to other sites. Users often rely on Facebook to maintain connections with old friends who may have moved away, making it a valuable tool for staying in touch over long distances.

Despite its benefits, mainstream social media platforms like Facebook can expose users to negative aspects such as hate speech, negativity, and the presence of fake influencers. These detrimental elements can impact users' mental well-being and self-esteem, leading to concerns about the authenticity of interactions on social media. The concept of impression management theory is especially noticeable in online environments, where individuals curate their online personas to create specific impressions on others.

Goffman's theory of social exchange also influences how relationships are formed and maintained in the digital sphere. Users navigate social media interactions based on this theory, seeking to exchange social currency in the form of likes, comments, and shares to establish connections and reinforce social bonds. However, the pervasive view of social media as artificial and toxic suggests that these online relationships may not always translate into meaningful real-world connections.

Different social media platforms cater to distinct purposes for users, with each platform offering unique communication styles and interaction options. Users adapt their communication strategies based on the platform they are using, recognizing that the choice of platform can shape the nature of their online interactions. Understanding these nuances is crucial for navigating the diverse social media landscape and leveraging its potential for meaningful connections and communication.

In conclusion, while social media remains a valuable tool for socializing and networking, it is important to be mindful of the potential pitfalls associated with these platforms. By recognizing the influence of impression management theory, Goffman's social exchange theory, and the varying communication styles across platforms, users can navigate social media more effectively and mitigate the negative effects on mental health and well-being.
