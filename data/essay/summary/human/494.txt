President Franklin Roosevelt spearheaded a series of initiatives to combat the Great Depression, with a primary focus on revitalizing the economy and bolstering essential infrastructure. These efforts were designed to enhance the quality of life for marginalized groups such as immigrants, African Americans, and laborers. One key initiative was the establishment of the Public Works Administration (PWA), which aimed to generate employment opportunities and enhance social infrastructure, thereby contributing to the overarching recovery strategy. Additionally, the Agricultural Adjustment Act (AAA) was enacted to ameliorate agricultural conditions by offering compensation to farmers who reduced their land holdings. This measure benefited a diverse array of individuals, including African Americans, immigrants, and workers, thereby fostering inclusivity in the recovery process.

Furthermore, the New Deal, a comprehensive set of policies and programs introduced by Roosevelt, played a pivotal role in steering the nation towards economic recovery. Through the creation of specialized agencies for different sectors, the regulation of wages and prices, and the implementation of programs catering to vulnerable populations and the unemployed, the New Deal aimed to address the multifaceted challenges brought about by the Great Depression. By prioritizing the needs of specific demographic groups and implementing strategic measures to stimulate economic growth, President Roosevelt's initiatives laid the groundwork for a more equitable and sustainable recovery from one of the most challenging periods in American history.
