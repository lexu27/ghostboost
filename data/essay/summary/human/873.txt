The status of women in Neo-Confucian societies in China and Japan was profoundly shaped by patriarchal norms and values. Chinese culture, in particular, imposed more stringent regulations on women compared to Japan, despite Japan having a historical background of a matrilocal system. In China, laws that were ostensibly designed to safeguard women often ended up curbing their freedom and violating their rights, exemplified by the oppressive Quing rape laws. Widows in China faced severe constraints, being compelled to either remarry or reside within their deceased husband's residence. However, amid these adversities, certain Chinese women, such as Chen Shu, managed to distinguish themselves in the field of art, showcasing resilience and talent.

Conversely, women in Japan enjoyed relatively more autonomy, although they were still required to defer to men and undertake domestic duties. The comparison of women's roles in both countries highlights the varying degrees of restrictions and freedoms experienced by women in Neo-Confucian societies.

Shifting focus to the Ottoman Empire in the 17th century, women, including those in harems, held diverse levels of power and influence. Dynastic marriages were prevalent in the Ottoman Empire, playing a pivotal role in bolstering political authority and impact. Turkish women outside the confines of harems possessed legal rights and could seek justice through legal channels for a range of issues, including the ability to initiate divorce proceedings if necessary. Despite the practice of men having multiple wives and concubines, Turkish women still wielded a degree of agency in selecting their spouses, although adherence to spousal expectations and obedience within marriage remained ingrained in societal norms.

In conclusion, the position of women in Neo-Confucian regimes in China and Japan, as well as within the Ottoman Empire during the 17th century, reflects a complex interplay of patriarchal structures, legal frameworks, cultural expectations, and individual agency. While women grappled with varying levels of constraints and freedoms across these societies, instances of resilience, talent, and autonomy emerged, underscoring the nuanced experiences of women navigating traditional gender roles and societal expectations.
