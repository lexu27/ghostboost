The shift in news consumption habits has seen a significant rise in the reliance on social media platforms over traditional mainstream sources like newspapers. A substantial 48% of Americans now turn to social media for their daily news fix, with Facebook leading the pack, followed closely by YouTube, Twitter, and Instagram. This trend is partly fueled by a growing distrust towards mainstream news outlets such as CNN, NBC, and FOX, where 65% of Americans feel they have been misled by journalists and reporters. As a result, individuals are seeking out alternative news sources to avoid perceived biases and misinformation prevalent in mainstream media.

However, the transition to social media for news consumption is not without its drawbacks. Issues such as anonymity, the rapid spread of unverified information, and the lack of accountability for spreading misleading reports pose serious challenges. While alternative news sources may offer a different perspective, they are not immune to biases, mirroring the problems found in mainstream media.

Moreover, the proliferation of news through social media can have more damaging consequences compared to traditional news sources. The unrestricted flow of information online allows for the rapid dissemination of false narratives and propaganda, contributing to the spread of misinformation and division among the public.

Influence in the media landscape extends beyond traditional outlets, with lobbyists playing a significant role in shaping narratives and influencing decision-makers and voters. By providing information and advocating for special interest groups, lobbyists hold considerable power in shaping public discourse and policy decisions, further complicating the already intricate web of news dissemination and consumption.
