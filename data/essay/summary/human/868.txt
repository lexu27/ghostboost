Castors, commonly known as casters, are essential components that simplify the movement of various objects, reducing the effort required to change their position. These wheel mechanisms consist of six key parts: a metal base, two vertical supports, four screws, bushings, an axle, and a wheel.

The metal base, typically crafted from malleable cast iron, serves as the foundation for assembling the caster mechanism. It provides stability and strength to support the weight of the object while ensuring smooth movement across different surfaces. The two vertical supports, also made of malleable cast iron, play a crucial role in holding the wheel in place. Their design is aimed at facilitating seamless rolling without encountering unnecessary friction.

To securely attach the vertical supports to the base, four socket head cap screws are utilized. These screws ensure that the components are firmly fixed together, enhancing the overall stability and durability of the caster assembly. Furthermore, two bushings, composed of tin bearing bronze, are incorporated to reduce friction between surfaces and keep the axle in position.

The axle, typically constructed from AISI 1020 carbon steel, serves as the central component that enables the wheel to spin freely. By allowing the wheel to rotate smoothly, the axle simplifies the movement of the object, making it easier to reposition as needed. Finally, the wheel itself, often made of malleable cast iron, is placed between the vertical supports and the axle. This arrangement not only supports the weight of the object but also minimizes the effort required to change its position.

In conclusion, casters are indispensable tools that enhance mobility and efficiency in various applications. By understanding the key components that make up a caster mechanism, one can appreciate how these simple yet essential devices contribute to making everyday tasks more manageable and less laborious.
