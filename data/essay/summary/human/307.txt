Nathaniel Hawthorne's "Young Goodman Brown," written in 1835 but set in Puritan New England during the late 17th century, delves into the rigid beliefs and moral values of the Puritans. These early settlers, having split from England's Anglican Church and settled at Plymouth Rock, established themselves as the primary Christian sect in New England. The Puritans, known for their strict principles and lack of tolerance for errors, condemned immoral thoughts as sinful. While the Puritans held a dominant presence, other Christian groups like Quakers and Anabaptists coexisted in New England. Interestingly, the Puritans considered Native Americans who did not adhere to Christianity as offspring of Satan, showcasing their extreme views. The narrative unfolds against the backdrop of the Salem Witch Trials, shedding light on the hypocritical and narrow moral standards upheld by the Salem Puritans. Through "Young Goodman Brown," Hawthorne masterfully critiques the Puritanical society of the time, unearthing the complexities of faith, morality, and human nature.
