During adolescence, individuals undergo a significant phase of identity formation where they constantly reassess their sense of self and direction in life. Negative interactions, such as name-calling and bullying, especially within same-sex peer groups, can have profound effects on a teenager's development. Research suggests that negative name-calling among peers can even influence an adolescent's gender identity, prompting some to seek identification with the opposite sex as a way to cope with such experiences.

It is crucial to recognize that homophobia and negative behaviors targeting both homosexual and heterosexual adolescents are more about hurting feelings than highlighting actual flaws. Such actions not only impact the victim's emotional well-being but can also hinder their overall personality development. Gender identity development during adolescence plays a pivotal role in shaping one's personality, and any form of victimization, particularly homophobic name-calling, should be strongly discouraged, if not prohibited, in schools to prevent further harm.

Furthermore, bullying behaviors often stem from the bullies' own struggles with gender conformity and self-acceptance. By victimizing adolescents, including those who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or heterosexual, there is a heightened risk of mental health issues and substance abuse. To address these challenges, prevention practices targeting substance abuse among adolescents, irrespective of their sexual orientation or gender identity, are essential to safeguard their well-being and promote a supportive school environment where all students can thrive.
