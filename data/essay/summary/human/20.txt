In the discussion surrounding the creation of a web-based system to manage university information on students and transcripts, the focus is on the risks involved in such an endeavor. These risks are broadly divided into two categories: those that affect the project's progression and completion, and those that impact the performance of the final product. Under the umbrella of risks to project continuation, considerations include potential delays, the possibility of key project members falling ill, and the occurrence of hardware or software malfunctions. On the other hand, risks influencing the end product's functionality encompass issues related to security vulnerabilities, economic viability, and adherence to university specifications.

Monitoring time-related concerns involves comparing the project's advancement against the established timeline, while assessing functional risks entails testing the system against predetermined requirements. To tackle challenges stemming from time constraints and potential hardware failures, it is suggested that additional time be allocated to the project, thereby offering a buffer to mitigate these risks. However, addressing risks tied to the system's performance could pose a more formidable obstacle if not detected during the testing phase, requiring a more reactionary approach to resolving such issues.

The critical nature of these risks necessitates their inclusion in a feasibility report to guarantee the project's success. By identifying, analyzing, and proactively addressing these risks, project stakeholders can enhance the likelihood of developing a robust and effective web-based system for managing university information.
