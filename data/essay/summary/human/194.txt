Diabetes is a prevalent medical condition that affects many individuals worldwide. There are primarily two types of diabetes: type 1 and type 2. Type 1 diabetes is the result of an autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells in individuals who are genetically predisposed. This destruction leads to insulin deficiency, causing issues in processing glucose in peripheral tissues. On the other hand, type 2 diabetes is mainly caused by insulin resistance, where cells have a decreased response to insulin, impacting glucose absorption and glycogen synthesis.

The consequences of insulin deficiency in type 1 diabetes are significant. It stimulates the secretion of hormones like glucagon, which triggers processes in the liver such as gluconeogenesis, glycogenolysis, and ketogenesis. These processes lead to hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis, which can be detrimental to one's health.

Management of diabetes, regardless of type, involves following a structured diet. For type 1 diabetes, a diet rich in carbohydrates from fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, and skim milk is recommended. In contrast, individuals with type 2 diabetes should focus on consuming complex carbohydrates like brown rice, whole wheat, fruits, vegetables, and beans. It is crucial for both types to avoid simple carbohydrates such as sugar, pasta, white bread, flour, cookies, and pastries.

In terms of medication, insulin plays a crucial role in managing diabetes. For type 1 diabetes, insulin Degludec (Tresiba) is essential alongside the recommended diet. Additionally, Zynquista can be used in combination with insulin. For individuals with type 2 diabetes, if diet, weight loss, exercise, and medications do not effectively control blood glucose levels, they may need insulin therapy. Options such as Insulin Degludec or the oral drug Metformin are commonly used.

In conclusion, proper medication, adherence to a structured diet, and lifestyle modifications are essential in effectively managing diabetes. By following these guidelines, individuals with diabetes can lead a healthier life and reduce the risks associated with this condition.
