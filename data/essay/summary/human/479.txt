The global health landscape has been profoundly affected by the Coronavirus pandemic, both directly through the virus itself and indirectly through the challenges it poses in maintaining overall well-being. In such times, staying physically active and engaging in regular exercise have emerged as crucial components in preserving health, enhancing immunity, and decreasing the susceptibility to various diseases.

However, the current COVID-19 situation has introduced obstacles to maintaining a physically active lifestyle, particularly with concerns surrounding virus transmission in public settings. Public gatherings, such as gyms, have become less feasible for exercise due to issues of proximity and safety during the ongoing pandemic.

Nonetheless, the significance of regular physical activity cannot be understated, especially in combating health issues and ensuring individuals remain in good shape amidst the emergence of new coronavirus variants. To adapt to the new normal, recommended exercises during quarantine include activities like push-ups, single-leg step-ups, shoulder lateral raises, jumping rope, and walking, which can all be done in the comfort and safety of one's home.

The emphasis on staying physically active has only amplified during the COVID-19 era, underlining the necessity of paying attention to one's body shape and health. Both aerobic exercises and strength training have been identified as particularly beneficial in enhancing overall health, fortifying immunity, and lowering the risk of various diseases. As the world navigates through these challenging times, prioritizing physical activity remains a cornerstone in promoting well-being and resilience in the face of adversities like the ongoing pandemic.
