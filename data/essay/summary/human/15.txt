In today's society, disparities in privileges among individuals based on factors such as race, ethnicity, and social class often result in the marginalization of certain groups. Racial discrimination stands out as a significant issue that should not be accepted in any form within the modern world. The criminal justice system in the United States is designed to be impartial towards all races and genders; however, it frequently exhibits bias against minorities, perpetuating systemic inequalities.

The tragic case of George Floyd serves as a poignant example highlighting the deep-rooted problems of injustice and powerlessness experienced by marginalized communities. As a response to such injustices, the Black Lives Matter movement has emerged, underlining the critical need for active anti-racism and the use of our voices to advocate for meaningful change. Mere symbolic gestures are not enough; genuine progress requires engaging in substantive dialogues, extending support, and actively advocating for those who suffer from injustices in our society.

Empathy and concrete actions are essential to address the systemic inequalities prevalent in our institutions and to hold those in authority accountable for their actions. Despite numerous documented instances of injustices and widespread calls for justice, there remains a concerning lack of accountability when it comes to addressing the excessive use of force by law enforcement personnel. True reform necessitates a collective effort to confront these issues head-on and create a more just and equitable society for all individuals, regardless of their background or identity.
