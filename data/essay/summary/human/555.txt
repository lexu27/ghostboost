In the literary works of "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" and "Frankenstein," a profound exploration of science unfolds, shedding light on common portrayals of scientific endeavors by the respective authors. These renowned works delve into the intertwined themes of science and integrity, ultimately suggesting that the pursuit of scientific knowledge can often lead to destructive outcomes.

The central figures in these narratives, Dr. Jekyll, Mr. Hyde, and Victor Frankenstein, are depicted as scientists driven by selfish motivations and personal ambitions rather than a genuine quest for knowledge. Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde embody self-centered and egotistical traits, showcasing the darker aspects of human nature when scientific boundaries are overstepped. Conversely, Victor Frankenstein is portrayed as a man of integrity who, upon realizing the repercussions of his experiment, grapples with profound regret and moral turmoil.

The lack of accountability and ethical consideration exhibited by these scientists paves the way for tragic consequences, resulting in the untimely deaths of innocent individuals. By crossing ethical boundaries and prioritizing personal desires over ethical guidelines, both Dr. Jekyll and Frankenstein emphasize the perilous implications of unchecked scientific pursuits in a society fraught with moral dilemmas.

Furthermore, the experiments conducted by these characters echo the scientific ideologies prevalent in the nineteenth century, underscoring a pervasive disregard for ethical constraints and moral responsibilities in the pursuit of knowledge. The unethical conduct portrayed in these works not only underscores the detrimental impact on society but also calls into question the ethical integrity of scientific research and innovation.

As both narratives unfold, the unethical practices and moral transgressions of the protagonists serve as cautionary tales, warning against the dire consequences of forsaking ethical standards in scientific exploration. Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, alongside Frankenstein, accentuate the potential for science to be manipulated as a tool for violence, emphasizing the critical importance of upholding ethical conduct and moral principles in all scientific endeavors.

In conclusion, "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" and "Frankenstein" intricately weave together a narrative that underscores the complexities of scientific pursuit and the moral obligations that accompany such endeavors. Through the characters of Dr. Jekyll, Mr. Hyde, and Frankenstein, these works serve as poignant reminders of the catastrophic implications that arise when science is divorced from ethical considerations, echoing a resounding call for conscientious and principled scientific conduct in a world where the boundaries between progress and peril remain perilously thin.
