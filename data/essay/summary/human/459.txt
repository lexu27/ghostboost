Overpopulation in cities presents a significant environmental and social dilemma, encompassing issues such as congestion, pollution, and poverty. The uncontrolled expansion of urban areas not only leads to overcrowding but also contributes to pollution stemming from road transport emissions, particularly affecting rural migrants who face increased poverty levels. Government intervention plays a pivotal role in the implementation of preventive measures to combat the challenges posed by overpopulation.

Poverty serves as a driving force compelling individuals from rural regions to migrate to cities in search of better employment opportunities, thus exacerbating social disparities. The influx of people into urban areas also results in difficulties related to garbage disposal, underscoring the importance of effective waste management strategies. Encouraging the use of public transportation over private vehicles is crucial in combating traffic congestion and air pollution, necessitating a shift towards sustainable commuting practices.

Investing in infrastructure development, such as roads and public transport systems, is vital for mitigating congestion and pollution within cities. These efforts not only enhance mobility but also contribute to environmental conservation by reducing carbon emissions. Despite the prevailing challenges, global trends indicate progress in alleviating poverty on a broader scale, signaling positive advancements in addressing socio-economic disparities worldwide.

In conclusion, addressing overpopulation in cities requires a multi-faceted approach encompassing government intervention, sustainable urban planning, and investments in infrastructure. By prioritizing environmental sustainability, social equity, and poverty alleviation, societies can work towards creating more livable and resilient urban environments for current and future generations.
