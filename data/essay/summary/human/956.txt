Diabetes mellitus is a prevalent health issue worldwide, particularly with type 2 diabetes affecting approximately 90% of individuals with the disease. The impact of diabetes complications extends beyond a single organ, affecting various parts of the body and leading to severe consequences. In the United States, research underlines the significant medical concern posed by diabetes, especially among older individuals who make up a substantial portion of those affected by the condition. 

One of the primary challenges in diabetes management is the lack of patient knowledge and adherence to treatment strategies, resulting in complications that necessitate frequent visits to healthcare facilities. As the population ages, the prevalence of diabetes is expected to increase significantly, emphasizing the importance of effective management strategies and interventions. 

Nurses play a vital role in the care and management of diabetes, from recognizing clinical manifestations to delivering essential treatments. However, barriers to evidence-based practice in diabetes management persist, including constraints such as limited appointment times, communication challenges, and inadequate patient education. Overcoming these barriers is crucial to improving patient outcomes and quality of care in diabetes management.

Nursing standards and policies are designed to support nurse-led care in diabetes management, highlighting the significance of autonomy and individualized approaches to treatment. By focusing on personalized care strategies and empowering nurses to take the lead in diabetes management, healthcare providers can enhance patient education, improve treatment adherence, and ultimately achieve better health outcomes for individuals with diabetes.
