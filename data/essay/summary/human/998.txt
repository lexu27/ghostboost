"Edges of the Rainbow" is a poignant creation by Michael Delsol and Haruku Shinozaki in 2017, delving into the world of LGBTQ+ community representatives in Japan through a blend of striking photographs and personal narratives. Delsol, a renowned French photographer celebrated for his portrayal of individuals engaged in artistic endeavors, has garnered recognition through features in diverse media platforms and exhibitions alongside fellow photographers.

On the other hand, Shinozaki is a dedicated journalist with a focus on marginalized communities in Japan, particularly shining a light on the lives of LGBTQ+ members. Their collaborative effort in this book is not only an artistic endeavor but also a platform that addresses critical societal issues. The audience targeted by this book is diverse, ranging from social activists to minority group representatives, demographic researchers, and individuals interested in understanding marginalized communities within the Japanese context.

Through "Edges of the Rainbow," the creators aim to navigate the complex landscape of Japan, a country known for its conformist and traditional values, and uncover the experiences of minorities. The book adeptly explores the visible LGBTQ+ culture in Japan while also delving into the underlying prejudices and conservatism that pose challenges to the community. The stories featured in the book offer a mosaic of diverse individuals within the LGBTQ+ spectrum, including an Episcopal priest providing sanctuary for parishioners and initiatives like akta that advocate for sexual education and HIV/AIDS prevention.

A core aspect of the book is its mission to challenge stereotypes surrounding the LGBTQ+ community by portraying individuals from various professions as ordinary people with unique histories and vibrant personalities. In doing so, "Edges of the Rainbow" serves as a form of protest against the struggles faced by minorities in a society deeply rooted in tradition, advocating for tolerance, understanding, and acceptance. By igniting conversations on once-taboo topics in Japanese culture, the book contributes to shaping a more inclusive and compassionate society for all.
