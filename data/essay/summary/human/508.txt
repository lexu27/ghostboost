The Coronavirus disease, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, has swiftly evolved into a global pandemic, instilling fear and resulting in a significant loss of lives worldwide. This crisis has presented profound challenges to public health systems, food supplies, and economies on a global scale, affecting families across the globe. Disparities in knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAPs) regarding COVID have been observed, with variations influenced by factors such as race, education, and income levels. In the United States, Hispanic and African-American communities have experienced higher rates of infection and mortality from COVID, shedding light on the existing socio-economic and racial disparities in health outcomes within the country.

Studies have indicated that White individuals tend to possess greater knowledge about COVID compared to their Hispanic and African-American counterparts. However, African-Americans and Hispanics demonstrate a more cautious attitude towards the virus, despite facing challenges such as lower health insurance coverage. Interestingly, Hispanic and African-American populations exhibit higher adherence to COVID preventive measures than White individuals, emphasizing the influence of social norms and cultural practices on behavior.

It is evident that the dissemination of accurate information, fostering positive attitudes, and inclusive decision-making processes can significantly impact how individuals respond to COVID and contribute to curbing its transmission, particularly among marginalized groups. By addressing knowledge gaps, promoting supportive attitudes, and involving diverse communities in decision-making, we can work towards reducing the disproportionate impact of the pandemic on minority populations and fostering a more resilient and united global response.
