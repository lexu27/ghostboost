In his exploration of the nature of pain, Putnam delves into the question of whether pain solely exists as a brain state, or if it also encompasses bodily reactions. By studying the differences in brain structures across various life forms, Putnam challenges the notion that physical responses such as pain can be confined to the realm of brain states alone. He introduces the concept of "functional state" to elucidate the fundamental physiological reactions to irritants, highlighting the intricate relationship between brain activities and bodily expressions.

Contrary to the prevailing theory of type-physicalism, which posits the identity of mental and physical properties, Putnam asserts that such a simplistic view does not account for the complexity of pain experiences. Through practical observations of diverse creatures exhibiting distinct behaviors in response to pain, Putnam establishes a foundation for his argument. While some philosophers contend that pain is a uniform experience across species, Putnam presents evidence of brain adaptability and flexibility that refutes this notion, emphasizing the role of individual differences in shaping pain perceptions.

Putnam advocates for a classification of pain based on its functional manifestations, emphasizing the importance of behaviors as indicators of underlying physiological processes. He critiques the brain state theory, which attempts to equate mental and physical states, for its failure to align with empirical data and observable phenomena. By underscoring the discrepancies between theoretical frameworks and practical evidence, Putnam challenges the traditional understanding of pain and calls for a more nuanced approach that considers the intricate interplay between brain functions, bodily responses, and behavioral outcomes.

Through his rigorous examination of pain as a multifaceted phenomenon, Putnam invites us to reconsider our assumptions about the nature of suffering and the complexities inherent in our experiences of pain. By integrating empirical observations with philosophical inquiry, Putnam sheds light on the intricate dynamics at play in the perception and manifestation of pain, paving the way for a more comprehensive understanding of this fundamental aspect of human and animal existence.
