The military conflict between the United States and Spain in 1898 was ignited by the American government's backing of Cuba's quest for independence from Spanish rule. The pivotal event that propelled the US into action was the explosion of the USS "Maine" in Havana, prompting the US invasion of Cuba. Escalating tensions with Spain were fueled by various provocations, necessitating war preparations on both sides.

For the United States, the liberation of Cuba held significant financial and strategic value, driving its involvement in the conflict. The US framed the war as a noble crusade for human rights and the best interests of Cuba, justifying its intervention on moral grounds. In a swift ten-week war, the US emerged victorious over the Spanish army in April 1898, culminating in the acquisition of Cuba through the Treaty of Paris.

While the US occupation of Cuba was depicted as a righteous endeavor, it essentially constituted a more subtle form of governance under the guise of benevolence. Exploiting the oppression faced by the Cuban population, the US sought to legitimize its presence and bolster support for the rebel cause, perpetuating its influence in the region through strategic alliances and control mechanisms.
