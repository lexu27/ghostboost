Spanjer introduces the term "worldview" to encompass a comprehensive approach to learning, scholarship, experience, and knowledge. Within this framework, thinkers are encouraged to engage with a myriad of logical and surreal questions, even if they may not initially agree on solutions. Time is viewed as a crucial element in dispelling false beliefs among these intellectuals.
