Patient mortality in intensive care units is a pressing issue that concerns medical professionals worldwide. One significant factor that can impact patient outcomes is the effective placement of tubes during resuscitation efforts, as this can support healthy circulation and potentially lower mortality rates.

To address this concern and improve patient care, a project is underway to assess the relationship between nurses' understanding of capnography and its application in coronary care units. The primary objective of this project is to shed light on the various factors influencing the utilization of capnography while also bridging existing gaps in the relevant literature.

As part of the project, nurses will receive specialized training on the advantages of capnography, followed by the practical implementation of this knowledge in critical care settings. By equipping nurses with the necessary skills and knowledge, the project aims to streamline the integration of capnography in the selected coronary care unit, ultimately enhancing patient care and accelerating the recovery process.

Recruitment for the project will focus on nurses working in a specific coronary care unit located in Central Jersey. The project is structured to span a period of twenty-four weeks, during which the confidential test results will be instrumental in evaluating nursing proficiency in capnography. Through these efforts, the project seeks to elevate standards of care in critical settings and bolster patient outcomes.
