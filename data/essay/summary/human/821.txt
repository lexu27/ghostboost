Cultural humility plays a vital role in enhancing the effectiveness, responsiveness, and accessibility of services within human service organizations. This concept goes beyond cultural competence by emphasizing self-evaluation, addressing power imbalances, and forming partnerships with communities to better serve individuals and defined populations. While many organizations acknowledge the significance of cultural humility, not all have specific statements outlining it.

One such organization, the Connecticut Coalition to End Homelessness, has a statement on Cultural Competency and Responsiveness that highlights the importance of serving diverse populations. However, this statement falls short in providing practical examples of how cultural safety principles are implemented in practice. There is a growing recognition of the need to prioritize cultural humility over cultural competence in service provision.

Recommendations put forth include the demonstration of examples showcasing cultural safety implementation and a greater focus on cultural humility. To improve cultural humility practices, suggestions include engaging bilingual young adults to communicate with specific populations, such as young Hispanics. By actively involving diverse communities in the processes and decisions of human service organizations, cultural humility can be fostered and lead to more inclusive and effective service delivery models.
