Fatigue is a prevalent symptom in chronic conditions such as chronic heart failure and acute myocardial infarction; however, its effects on stable coronary heart disease (CHD) patients have not been extensively explored. Eckhardt et al. (2014) and a team of researchers sought to evaluate the severity and characteristics of fatigue in stable CHD patients, along with its association with demographic, physiological, and psychological variables. Their study encompassed a mixed-method design that integrated quantitative and qualitative methodologies to comprehend fatigue in CHD patients.

To achieve their objective, statistical analysis was performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, with statistical significance set at an alpha level of less than .05. The research involved 102 stable CHD patients from both urban and rural clinics who met specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. The independent variables in the study encompassed demographic, physiological, and psychological factors, while the dependent variable was the relationship between fatigue and these factors.

The results of the study unveiled that depressive symptoms played a pivotal role as a substantial predictor of fatigue interference and intensity among stable CHD patients. This discovery sheds light on the significance of recognizing and addressing mental health aspects in patients with CHD to enhance their overall well-being.

In conclusion, the findings of this research offer valuable insights for nursing practice by highlighting the impact of fatigue on stable CHD patients and emphasizing the necessity for implementing strategies aimed at ameliorating their quality of life. By acknowledging the role of depressive symptoms in fatigue severity and interference, healthcare providers can develop more targeted interventions to support CHD patients in managing their condition effectively.
