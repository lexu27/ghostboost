The concept of being human is a multifaceted and intricate subject, as explored in the passage. It delves into the challenges of defining humanity, encompassing ideas from self-sufficiency to the refinements of society. Each individual possesses unique desires, aspirations, and perspectives on how they wish to lead their lives, making it a daunting task to create generalizations about human nature.

Thich Nhat Hanh, in the On Being podcast, sheds light on the significance of maintaining our humanity to cultivate understanding and compassion. He underscores the importance of mindfulness and accountability in being truly human. According to him, being human entails the freedom to err but not the license to persist in making mistakes. The podcast also confronts the difficulties of existing in a world marred by violence and ineffective communication, which hinders the pursuit of authentic living.

Nhat Hanh advocates for living a life free from anger, with mindfulness and emotional regulation, qualities that pose a challenge for many in today's fast-paced society. Despite the struggle, his insights on navigating modern challenges and embracing human nature are highly valued in the podcast. Even though the author may not align with the Buddhist worldview, there is admiration for Thich Nhat Hanh's mindful practices and conscious existence, which serve as a wellspring of inspiration.
