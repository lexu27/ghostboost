Osteoarthritis is a prevalent disease that inflicts significant personal, economic, and societal costs due to its disabling effects. Unfortunately, it is often mishandled within the healthcare system, resulting in pain, diminished function, and a lower quality of life for affected individuals. The condition primarily impacts articular cartilage, causing degeneration and damage that worsens over time. Moreover, osteoarthritis affects not only the cartilage but also the entire joint, including the synovium, ligaments, and bones.

Despite its widespread occurrence, osteoarthritis is frequently overlooked in global health strategies for noncommunicable diseases. This lack of attention has led to various misconceptions about the condition, contributing to therapeutic nihilism and a dearth of treatment options. It is crucial to address these misconceptions and enhance awareness of osteoarthritis to improve patient outcomes.

Moreover, current healthcare approaches often fail to prioritize essential treatments such as exercise, weight management, and patient education. These interventions are crucial in managing osteoarthritis effectively and promoting better overall health for individuals with the condition. Additionally, rehabilitation counseling presents a promising avenue for a holistic approach that combines physical and psychological support to assist patients in coping with osteoarthritis and its consequences.

In conclusion, osteoarthritis poses a significant burden on individuals and society due to its disabling nature and associated costs. By addressing misconceptions, prioritizing essential treatments, and implementing comprehensive rehabilitation counseling, we can improve the management of osteoarthritis and enhance the quality of life for those affected by this debilitating condition.
