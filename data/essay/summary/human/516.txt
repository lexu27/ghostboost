The early Christian congregations flourished in Greek territories, where the Greeks' receptiveness to novel concepts fostered the formation of numerous Christian communities. Cities such as Patras, Corinth, Thessaloniki, Philippi, and Athens became hubs for these thriving Christian populations. The introduction of Christian naming practices in Greece marked a significant shift, gradually displacing the traditional Roman 'tria nomina' naming conventions. Over time, Roman names underwent a transformation, becoming shorter and intermingling with Greek names.

Following the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, the Roman naming system faced a steady decline, with praenomen losing relevance by the fifth century. The fading of Roman institutions further eroded the distinctions between nomens and cognomens. Concurrently, the Greek naming system gained momentum, spreading across Western Europe by the seventh century. Influenced by Christian ideologies and societal transformations, the Greek naming system emerged victorious over the Roman counterpart, renowned for its simplicity and adaptability. This transition represented a broader cultural shift reflecting the evolving dynamics of naming conventions and societal preferences.
