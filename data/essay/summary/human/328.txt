The utilization of registered nurses as primary team members in telehealth visits within outpatient settings is a pivotal strategy aimed at enhancing patient outcomes. With the escalating demand for telehealth services, integrating registered nurses into telehealth interactions has become imperative to ensure effective patient care. The primary goal of this research is to investigate the impact of registered nurses as key team members during telehealth visits, focusing on Evidence-Based Practice to elevate patient outcomes.

To substantiate the role of nurses in telehealth, a comprehensive review was conducted using reputable databases such as CINAHL Plus and Pubmed. The search strategy involved keywords like "registered nurse and telehealth" within the last decade to amass relevant evidence supporting the pivotal role of nurses in telehealth settings. Various empirical studies underscore the critical contribution of nurses in telehealth engagements, shedding light on the determinants that influence the efficacy of telehealth interventions.

In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, professional organizations and experts underscore the indispensable role of nurses in advancing telehealth practices to bolster patient care and communication. Particularly, Advanced Practice Nurses (APNs) emerge as key players in delivering high-quality care and enhancing patient satisfaction across diverse healthcare domains, including emergency and critical care settings. The burgeoning responsibilities of APNs underscore the evolving landscape of nursing roles, underscoring the necessity for continual evaluation and reinforcement of these advanced roles.

In conclusion, leveraging registered nurses as integral team members during telehealth encounters in outpatient settings holds immense promise in elevating patient outcomes through evidence-based approaches. The confluence of research findings, expert insights, and empirical evidence accentuates the pivotal role that nurses, especially APNs, play in revolutionizing telehealth practices to cater to the evolving needs of patient care in contemporary healthcare settings. Embracing and supporting the expansion of nursing roles, particularly those of APNs, is paramount to ensuring the delivery of quality care and fostering patient-centered outcomes in the dynamic healthcare landscape.
