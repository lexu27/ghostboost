In Neil Foley's book "Mexicans in the Making of America," the role of Mexican Americans in U.S. history is deeply explored. The first chapter, titled "The Genesis of Mexican America," delves into the historical background of Mexican Americans and the tumultuous relationship with the United States. Foley argues that the American government played a significant role in painting Mexican immigrants in a negative light, consequently leading to the stigmatization of Mexican Americans within society.

During the 1830s, white settlers from the southern states were deemed illegal invaders in Texas, showcasing early tensions in the region. Discrimination against Mexican immigrants and citizens further intensified following the 1846-1848 war and subsequent treaty, perpetuating negative stereotypes and biases. Despite Mexico's rich historical contributions, many Americans unfairly portrayed the country as one populated by cruel and uneducated individuals, further fueling existing prejudices.

The conflict between the U.S. and Mexico was widely viewed as an unjust act of aggression, deepening the divide between the two nations. Mexican Americans encountered numerous challenges in asserting their rights and often sought to identify more with their Spanish heritage rather than their Mexican roots as a means of navigating societal barriers. These historical events not only shaped a political border but also strained relations between the United States and Mexico, contributing to a complex interplay of identity and perception.

In essence, the first chapter scrutinizes the origins of Mexican Americans and sheds light on how the Texas annexation significantly influenced their portrayal, relationships, and place within American society.
