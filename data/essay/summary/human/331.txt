HP, a prominent technology company, provides investors with vital insights through its annual report to aid in decision-making processes. By evaluating risk factors and financial performance indicators highlighted in these reports, investors can make informed choices. Two primary risk factors facing HP are the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic and its heavy reliance on third-party suppliers. Such risks underscore the importance of risk-related information for investors, especially concerning supply chain operations and product delivery.

In 2021, HP experienced a significant growth in its total net revenue, which surged by 12.1%, attributed to increased sales of laptops and supplies. This growth was further supported by a 2.7% increase in gross margin driven by favorable currency impacts and the shift to remote work. Notably, HP maintained a healthy profit margin percentage of 10.24%, demonstrating its resilience in the current market conditions.

When considering financing options, angel investors could serve as a viable debt financing source for HP. However, tapping into stock funding for equity financing may pose challenges, risking HP's sourcing and competitive position against institutional investors. Despite these considerations, HP's stock price exhibited a positive trend, starting to rise in December 2021. This increase was fueled by HP's strong presence in the PC market and its stable operating margin, indicating investor confidence in the company's performance and future prospects.
