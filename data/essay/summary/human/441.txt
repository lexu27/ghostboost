The English colonization of America in the 17th century resulted in the establishment of two distinct regions - New England and the Chesapeake Bay. The first English colonists arrived in these regions with different purposes and societal structures. The Virginia Company initially sought profits from settling in the Chesapeake Bay area but transitioned to cultivating tobacco due to its lucrative nature. This shift led to the recruitment of mainly young single males engaged in labor-intensive tobacco farming. In contrast, the New England colonies were founded to escape religious persecution and to establish virtuous societies with self-sustaining economies. Unlike the Chesapeake Bay settlers, New Englanders arrived as families, reflecting their focus on community and stability rather than individual profit.

Religion played a significant role in shaping both regions, albeit in different ways. New England colonies aimed to create perfect Protestant communities, emphasizing religious purity and communal values. On the other hand, the Chesapeake Bay colonies had a strong Anglican influence, particularly in their interactions with Native Americans. These religious differences not only influenced daily life but also impacted the overall societal structure and governance in each region. Settlement patterns and societal forces varied greatly between New England and the Chesapeake Bay, shaping their economies, social norms, and political systems.

Furthermore, the Protestant and Anglican denominations further highlighted the divergent paths taken by the New England and Chesapeake Bay colonies. While New England sought to establish a society based on Protestant beliefs and communal living, the Chesapeake Bay region developed a plantation-based economy driven by cash crops and the Anglican Church's influence. These contrasting approaches to colonization had long-lasting effects on the development and identities of the two regions, showcasing the diverse outcomes of English settlement in early America.
