Glumetza is a medication used to manage glucose levels and insulin resistance through various dosage adjustments. While effective, it comes with common side effects like bloating, lactic acidosis, nausea, gastrointestinal discomfort, weight loss, and vitamin B12 deficiency. However, initiating metformin treatment should be approached cautiously as it can be associated with hemolytic anemia, especially in specific patient groups like pregnant women and individuals with alcohol use disorder. Patients with renal insufficiency are particularly at risk of experiencing medication toxicity when using metformin. It is advised to take metformin with meals to mitigate gastrointestinal side effects and to avoid abrupt discontinuation unless there are contraindications present. Furthermore, individuals with conditions such as renal failure or heart failure should refrain from using metformin. Specific glomerular filtration rates serve as a guideline for recommending or avoiding metformin in patients. Additionally, basal and prandial insulin types are categorized based on their onset, duration, and the risk of hypoglycemia they pose, offering healthcare providers options for tailored treatment plans to manage diabetes effectively.
