Between 1959 and 1963, music underwent significant evolution in tandem with societal changes, leading to the formation of distinct markets within the industry. One market targeted teenagers who favored dance music, while another appealed to former rock and rollers who gravitated towards folk music, which often addressed pertinent social issues. Unlike commercial pop, folk music historically served as a platform to tackle societal problems, emphasizing a community-oriented approach.

Folk performers, viewed as representatives of the people, established a deep connection with their audience. Their music was characterized by simplicity and required only basic guitar skills, embodying the ethos of being "for the people and by the people." Influential groups such as The Weavers and The Kingston Trio played pivotal roles in the folk movement, focusing on societal concerns and advocating for the essence of simplicity in music.

The Kingston Trio, in particular, resonated well with the public, shaping the broader perception of folk music. By embracing folk music, singers and audiences found a common ground to articulate shared social concerns through songs, highlighting the genre's role as a medium for expression and reflection of prevailing societal issues. Ultimately, the folk music movement of the early 1960s not only entertained but also empowered individuals to voice their collective experiences and concerns through the power of music.
