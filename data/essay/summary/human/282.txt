Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) have sparked intense debate due to their controversial nature, with ethical concerns at the forefront for many individuals. Some argue against altering genetic information, citing ethical reasons. However, the author of the essay views GMOs as a natural progression in technological advancements, akin to the development of machines or cars. In fact, the author has consumed GMO products without worrying about potential long-term effects, viewing them as a beneficial innovation.

Support for GMOs stems from a utilitarian perspective, where the author believes that if GMOs can benefit a significant number of people, then their use is ethical. One notable advantage of GMOs is their ability to address pressing issues like famine by creating crops that are resilient to challenging environmental conditions. Despite these benefits, critics raise objections on deontological grounds, arguing that manipulating genetic codes is morally inappropriate.

To counter this viewpoint, the author suggests that embracing innovative tools, including GMOs, aligns with the responsibility to care for the planet, as emphasized in religious teachings. While some individuals perceive GMOs as humans overstepping their boundaries by "playing God," the author sees using GMOs as a means of upholding Christian principles and demonstrating care for all living creatures. In essence, the debate surrounding GMOs intertwines ethics, technology, and religious beliefs, underscoring the complexity of this ongoing discussion.
