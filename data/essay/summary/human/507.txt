In the original Star Wars film, "A New Hope," the portrayal of heroes has sparked discussions on racial and gender stereotypes. The heroes are predominantly idealized white characters, while characters like Amidala and alien females are depicted with a focus on sexual aspects and stereotypical desires across different races. Amidala introduces a white actor wearing an Asian costume, and Twi'leks are seen as symbols of sexual conquest across races. These examples align with Berg's thesis that stereotypes in the film are portrayed with rigid logic and oversimplified generalizations. However, as the movie progresses, racial and gender aspects are redefined. Characters like Finn challenge stereotypes of black characters being unreliable by being portrayed as moral and courageous. Similarly, Rei represents a positive evolution of female heroines in Star Wars by breaking free from the sexualized and vulnerable stereotypes to become self-sufficient, brave, and strong. It is important to note that the initial stereotypes in the early Star Wars films were likely not intended for racist or sexist purposes but were portrayed without full awareness of their implications. The evolution of characters like Finn and Rei showcases a shift towards more diverse and empowering representations in the Star Wars universe.
