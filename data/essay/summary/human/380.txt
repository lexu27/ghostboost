Judgmental forecasting is a valuable approach that involves utilizing expert opinions to address complex issues where mathematical solutions may not be feasible. One prominent method in this realm is the Delphi method, which gathers expert assessments anonymously through several rounds to achieve reliable forecasts. Various resources, such as the book "Forecasting: Principles and Practice" and Sniezek's article, provide support and insights into the realm of judgmental forecasting.

The practice of judgmental forecasting plays a crucial role in formalizing the process of collecting and analyzing expert opinions to facilitate well-informed decision-making. It is particularly effective in scenarios where objects cannot be easily described mathematically, lack dependable statistical data, cannot undergo mathematical processing, or require swift decisions. Noteworthy examples of successful judgmental forecasting applications include central banks leveraging expert opinions to forecast economic activity and organizations utilizing it for product development.

There are notable advantages to employing judgmental forecasting. Its universality, simplicity, and suitability for long-term forecasts make it a compelling choice for various industries and decision-making processes. However, like any method, judgmental forecasting also comes with its set of drawbacks. One such limitation is the challenge of statistical methods offering more accurate short- and medium-term forecasts compared to judgmental forecasting's strength in providing reliable long-term forecasts.

In conclusion, judgmental forecasting stands out as a valuable tool for addressing complex problems that lack clear mathematical solutions. By harnessing expert opinions and formalizing the process of collecting and analyzing such insights, organizations can make well-informed decisions across various domains. While it offers simplicity and suitability for long-term forecasting, it is essential to recognize its limitations when compared to statistical methods for shorter time horizons. This dynamic interplay of advantages and disadvantages underscores the nuanced nature of judgmental forecasting in contemporary decision-making processes.
