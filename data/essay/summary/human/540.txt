Plato's "Gorgias" delves into the philosophical discussions between Socrates and sophists regarding the nature of virtue and rhetoric. Within this discourse, Gorgias posits that rhetoric serves as a tool for presenting arguments in a persuasive manner, enabling a rhetorician to effectively articulate on any subject matter. However, Socrates takes a critical stance towards prevalent oratory practices embraced by sophists, contending that these approaches prioritize the art of persuasion over the pursuit of truth. Such a focus on persuasion, according to Socrates, allows orators to appear knowledgeable without possessing genuine expertise, leading to a disdain for the manipulative aspects of oratory rhetoric.

In a modern context, the novel "Thank You for Smoking" vividly illustrates the potential abuse of rhetoric for persuasive ends, notably through the character of Nick Naylor, a lobbyist representing a tobacco company. Naylor adeptly employs rhetorical appeals, including Ethos, Logos, and Pathos, to sway opinions and emerge victorious in debates, irrespective of the veracity of his claims. This adept manipulation of rhetoric reaches a climax during Naylor's congressional speech, where he deliberately misleads his audience to garner support for his pro-cigarette arguments.

Through this narrative, the novel underscores the potent influence of rhetoric in shaping beliefs and behaviors, even when wielded in a manipulative fashion. It serves as a cautionary tale, highlighting how individuals like Naylor can exploit the power of language to sway perceptions and justify actions that may run counter to ethical or factual considerations. As such, the exploration of rhetoric in "Gorgias" and "Thank You for Smoking" emphasizes the nuanced interplay between persuasive language and moral integrity, urging readers to remain vigilant against the deceptive allure of eloquence.
