Language studies encompass various scientific approaches, with prescriptive and descriptive methods standing out prominently. Prescriptivism entails establishing specific rules for spoken and written language, advocating one interpretation as the societal standard. On the other hand, descriptivism focuses on documenting linguistic variations without enforcing rigid standards. Both approaches, while distinct, play essential roles and can complement each other effectively.

Prescriptive methods serve to bring organization to society by providing a structured framework for communication. In contrast, descriptive methods excel at capturing the authentic changes languages undergo over time. Misconceptions often arise regarding language evolution, such as the mistaken belief that changes equate to deterioration, negatively affecting education and media.

However, counterarguments exist against these fears, highlighting that language change is a natural phenomenon not solely influenced by media or educational norms. People's resistance to change often stems from a preference for familiar habits, yet language evolution is primarily driven by societal changes and its innovative members. Ultimately, recognizing the value of both prescriptive and descriptive approaches in language studies is crucial for appreciating the dynamic nature of language and the societal influences shaping its trajectory.
