In 2013, despite facing budget constraints, the police chief of Reading, Pennsylvania made a significant investment in crime prediction software known as PredPol. This software utilizes past crime data to forecast the occurrence of crimes in specific locations and timeframes. The implementation of predictive policing through PredPol resulted in a notable reduction of nearly 20% in burglaries within high-crime neighborhoods when law enforcement officers concentrated their efforts on these identified hotspots.

The concept of predictive policing has drawn parallels to statistical modeling in baseball, emphasizing its potential to mitigate racism and prejudice within law enforcement practices in contrast to other models such as recidivism. Police departments nationwide are progressively turning to data derived from predictive policing methods to support the enforcement of zero-tolerance policies for various offenses, both violent and nonviolent in nature.

One concerning aspect surrounding the utilization of predictive policing systems is the secrecy shrouding their inner workings from the public, sparking apprehensions regarding the transparency of such technologies. Furthermore, the combined utilization of predictive policing, stop-and-frisk initiatives, and recidivism models has been observed to disproportionately target individuals from non-white communities residing in low-income areas, ultimately fueling concerns of racial discrimination within law enforcement strategies.

Calls have been made for justice system data scientists to take into account the adverse effects of prison life on inmates' behavior, recognizing that factors such as malnourishment, prolonged solitary confinement, and exposure to assault can significantly impact an individual's actions and choices. Looking ahead, there are predictions that facial recognition algorithms will play a pivotal role in identifying potential threats in the future; however, apprehensions persist regarding issues of privacy invasion and the risk of perpetuating racial profiling through such technologies.
