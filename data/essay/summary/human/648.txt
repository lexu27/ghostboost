In her analysis of the portrayal of women in films, Kaplan delves into Laura Mulvey's The Male Gaze theory and psychoanalysis. Through this lens, Kaplan explores how women have historically been central to the melodrama genre, shedding light on the constraints imposed by familial roles. Melodrama, according to Kaplan, not only reveals these limitations but also ingrains them as societal norms for women. Kaplan argues that cultural norms are deeply rooted in power dynamics between men and women, perpetuating dominance-submission patterns. The male gaze, a concept prevalent in film, encourages a sexualized perspective that empowers men while objectifying women, prioritizing male desire above female agency. Films like The Postman Always Rings Twice (1946) and the Transformers series (2006â€“2014) exemplify the male gaze in practice. Despite attempts by filmmakers to infuse female characters with depth and purpose, the male gaze persists, relegating women to objects of visual pleasure even when they possess intricate backgrounds and motivations, as seen with characters like Catwoman in The Dark Knight Rises (2012).
