The bag market is a vast industry characterized by highly segmented customers and a diverse range of products in terms of quality and purpose. Adjusting the price of bags is crucial in order to maximize profits based on thorough data analysis. Initially priced at $250 after analyzing high-end tote bags, the impact of price on supply and demand was not taken into consideration. As a result, a new price of $65 was established to ensure profitability, still maintaining a margin twice the cost per unit, leading to an anticipated profit of $29 per bag. Online purchases account for 55% of customers, with tote bags emerging as the fastest-growing handbag style. The selected leather bag, priced at a minimum of $65, targets middle-class and higher-class mothers in the mid-range market segment. Effective marketing strategies are essential to build brand recognition, especially since the brand is currently unfamiliar in the market. Setting a high price range without a well-established brand image may potentially decrease demand and limit competitiveness with high-end bags. Proper pricing strategies and brand development are key factors in navigating the complexities of the bag market to achieve sustainable profitability and market success.
