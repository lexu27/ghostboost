In healthcare, nursing plays a crucial role in driving continuous improvement to meet evolving social trends. Central to this is the concept of evidence-based practice (EBP), which entails integrating research findings into patient care for optimal outcomes. However, nurses often encounter obstacles in embracing EBP, ranging from heavy workloads to resource limitations. 

One significant challenge is that management behavior tends to react to the environment rather than taking proactive steps to address barriers to EBP implementation. This reactive stance, coupled with a lack of organizational support and teamwork, further impedes the adoption of evidence-based practices in the workplace. 

To effectively promote EBP among nurses, it is essential to have leadership support and provide access to relevant sources such as databases and peer-reviewed publications. By equipping nurses with the necessary resources, the utilization of research can become more efficient and seamlessly integrated into daily practice. 

Despite the hurdles faced, intervention strategies can be implemented to overcome challenges and foster a culture that embraces evidence-based practices. By addressing workload issues, enhancing resources, and promoting teamwork, healthcare facilities can create an environment that supports and encourages the use of EBP. 

In conclusion, while barriers exist, concerted efforts to provide support, resources, and interventions are vital in advancing EBP among nurses. By addressing these challenges head-on, the healthcare sector can enhance the quality of patient care and stay aligned with the latest social trends and advancements in the field.
