Hospital-acquired pressure injuries (HAPI) are a significant concern in healthcare settings, characterized by localized damage to the skin and underlying tissue due to immobility and prolonged pressure on bony prominences. Several factors such as age, perfusion, nutritional status, disease severity, and diabetes contribute to the development of HAPI, making it a multifactorial issue to address. Shockingly, despite advances in healthcare, over a million patients in the USA still experience pressure injuries while hospitalized, highlighting the persistent challenge these injuries pose.

The impact of HAPI extends beyond physical discomfort, as studies have shown that patients who develop these injuries face a higher risk of mortality both during and after their hospital stay. Moreover, HAPI can lead to increased pain and suffering, delayed recovery, and prolonged hospitalizations, affecting patients' well-being and quality of life. As frontline caregivers, nurses play a pivotal role in the early identification and prevention of HAPI through diligent monitoring and proactive interventions.

Failure to prevent HAPI not only jeopardizes patient outcomes but also contributes to escalating healthcare costs. Addressing this issue requires a comprehensive approach that includes strategies to minimize shear and friction on the skin, as well as the implementation of pressure-reducing support surfaces such as specialized mattresses. By incorporating these solutions into standard care practices, healthcare providers can significantly reduce the incidence of HAPI and improve patient safety and comfort.

One pertinent research question in this domain is encapsulated in the PICOT question: How effective is minimizing shear and friction compared to using pressure redistribution surfaces in reducing HAPI development in elderly patients over a year? This question underscores the need for evidence-based practices to guide interventions aimed at preventing HAPI among vulnerable populations, emphasizing the importance of tailored approaches to address the specific needs of elderly patients at risk.

In conclusion, the prevention of HAPI is a critical aspect of patient care that demands attention and proactive measures from healthcare providers. By enhancing awareness, implementing best practices, and conducting further research to guide interventions, healthcare systems can work towards reducing the burden of HAPI on patients, improving outcomes, and optimizing resource utilization in hospitals.
