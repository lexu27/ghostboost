The spirit bear, also known as the Kermode bear, is a remarkable bear species found in British Columbia, celebrated for its distinct ice-cream-colored fur and its rarity in the wild. Weighing up to 200 kilograms, a single spirit bear falls within a relatively lower weight range compared to other bear species, which typically range from 80 to 600 kilograms. As a subspecies of the American black bear, the Kermode bear is characterized by a recessive gene that results in its unique white or creamy fur. Presently, only about 400 spirit bears inhabit British Columbia, with the majority residing in the expansive Great Bear Rainforest, a 6.4-million-hectare temperate rainforest that offers an ideal habitat for these bears, providing ample food sources such as salmon, berries, insects, and nuts.

Despite their size, spirit bears are known for their shy and non-threatening nature, only becoming aggressive if provoked. This behavior has ingrained them as sacred creatures among indigenous populations, while tourists often perceive them as harmless. Given their uniqueness and rarity, spirit bears necessitate protection and conservation efforts to safeguard their habitat. Furthermore, these bears play a crucial role in maintaining the delicate ecosystem of the Great Bear Rainforest, emphasizing the importance of preserving this endangered species.
