Education plays a significant role in shaping the narratives of "Everyday Use" by Alice Walker and "Sonnyâ€™s Blues" by James Baldwin. While Baldwin places a stronger emphasis on education compared to Walker, both authors explore how education influences the characters' lives. The stories center around sibling relationships, with Walker focusing on two sisters and Baldwin on two brothers.

In both works, one sibling has completed high school while the other lacks formal education, leading to contrasts in their lives and intellect. The importance and success associated with education are highlighted by both authors, with characters like Sonny's brother stressing the necessity of education for a brighter future.

Interestingly, Mama in "Everyday Use" undervalues formal education, prioritizing practical knowledge and skills over academic accomplishments. Despite this, the uneducated siblings in both stories are portrayed as wise and insightful on certain matters, challenging the notion that intelligence is solely derived from education.

Both narratives suggest that genuine knowledge and a deep understanding of life cannot be solely acquired through formal education. They emphasize the value of real-world experiences and practical wisdom in shaping individuals, indicating that education is just one aspect of a person's overall intelligence and growth.
