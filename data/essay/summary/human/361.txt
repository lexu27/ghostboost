The evolution of intelligent devices has given rise to the Internet of Things (IoT), managed through mobile applications, which has brought about safety challenges due to the limited technological security awareness among consumers. By 2006, security issues became prominent as internet-connected devices were easily compromised, with a considerable percentage of households possessing susceptible devices. The article underscores various flaws and concerns within the realm of IoT, accentuating the absence of clear security standards comprehensible to end-users.

Assessing the safety of IoT devices proves to be intricate, leading to the proposition of a hierarchical analytical method for evaluating device security using qualitative and quantitative attributes. The article advocates for the establishment of a user-friendly safety rating system for IoT gadgets, facilitating well-informed purchase choices based on security benchmarks. Utilizing the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is recommended for formulating security standards across diverse cyber systems, with a spotlight on aspects like privacy, attack prevention, authentication, and integration.

Consumer smart home devices commonly exhibit vulnerabilities such as susceptibility to attacks via internet access, usage of default passwords, delays in network layers, and probable data breaches by attackers. Enhancing IoT device security involves implementing measures like password modifications, software upgrades, additional authentication procedures, and diversification of cloud service providers. A security framework comprising criteria to combat risks at application, hardware, cloud, and network levels is proposed, enabling users to evaluate device security efficacy and make knowledgeable device selections.

The adaptability of this security model allows for customizations tailored to different devices, offering a comprehensive strategy to mitigate vulnerabilities in smart home gadgets. Through these recommended strategies and frameworks, the article underscores the significance of addressing IoT security concerns to safeguard consumers and fortify the integrity of interconnected devices in an increasingly digitized world.
