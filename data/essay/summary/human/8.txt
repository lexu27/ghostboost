The incident at a Chicago hot dog restaurant involving a man who refused to wear a mask quickly turned into a significant ethical dilemma with property damage and disrespect towards an employee. When the employee asked the man to wear a mask, he reacted by throwing snow at the employee and breaking the glass door. These extreme actions by the man not only resulted in property damage but also raised ethical concerns beyond just the physical harm caused.

From a Utilitarianism perspective, the incident is viewed as wrong due to the harmful consequences of the man's actions towards the employee and the property. The disproportionate response of the man highlights the ethical issues at play, emphasizing the negative impacts on individuals as a crucial criterion for assessing the ethicality of actions. On the other hand, Kantian moral theory condemns the man's behavior as irrational for disregarding moral duty and causing harm to others.

In this context, Utilitarianism emerges as a preferred approach to address such ethical problems because of its focus on negative consequences as a moral compass. While Kantian theory relies on moral law, it can sometimes lead to subjective interpretations of ethical issues, opening up room for ambiguity. By emphasizing the adverse effects on individuals as a measure of ethical behavior, Utilitarianism provides a more straightforward and practical way to evaluate actions in situations like the one at the Chicago hot dog restaurant.
