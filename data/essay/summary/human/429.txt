Supplier evaluation and selection in manufacturing companies have evolved, shifting towards strategic partnerships rather than solely focusing on operational efficiency. Various methodologies and criteria are discussed in the article to aid in this process. Methods such as mathematical models, SMART, ANP, AHP, DEA, and linear programming are highlighted for supplier assessment. DEA stands out as a methodology that categorizes suppliers as efficient or inefficient based on specific criteria, while mathematical programming models enable complex evaluations to determine the most cost-effective suppliers. The article points out the prevalence of DEA as the most common approach among the methodologies discussed.

Understanding the distribution of these methodologies is crucial for companies to choose the most effective ways to assess and select suppliers. Evaluating suppliers across strategic, functional, and operational levels is emphasized for a comprehensive selection process. DEA, mathematical programming, and AHP are recommended for identifying optimal suppliers, with AHP being recognized for providing consistency in supplier selection. By utilizing these methodologies and criteria, manufacturing companies can enhance their supplier selection processes and establish strategic partnerships that align with their business goals.
