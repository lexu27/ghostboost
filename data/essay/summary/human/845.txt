Gender theories play a crucial role in elucidating the underlying reasons behind gendered behavioral differences observed in males from diverse standpoints. One such perspective is biological determinism, which asserts that behavioral issues in males stem from their inherent competitive and aggressive nature. On the contrary, the social construction of gender theory posits that behaviors are acquired through learning and are heavily influenced by societal norms and expectations.

It is widely recognized that social influences play a pivotal role in shaping behavioral problems in males. Understanding various gender theories is paramount for effectively addressing such behavioral issues. Despite the evolution of gender theories over time, outdated concepts can still impact public perceptions and the rationale behind behaviors, highlighting the enduring importance of this field of study.

For instance, the mythopoetic men's movement continues to rely on biological determinism despite facing criticisms for its narrow perspective. Nevertheless, having knowledge of gender theories is indispensable for comprehending the justifications behind behaviors exhibited by males. By delving into these theories, individuals can gain deeper insights into the complexities of gendered behaviors and contribute to more informed discussions and interventions aimed at promoting healthier and more constructive behavioral patterns in males.
