In the short story "Where Are You Going, Where Have You Been?" by Stephen Slimp, the protagonist Connie undergoes a profound transformation in her spirit following her encounter with Arnold. Connie's deep desire for her mother stems from her realization of the malevolent presence embodied by Arnold. However, Connie's family proves to be ill-equipped in providing her with the necessary moral education or defensive strategies against true evil. This lack of guidance is further exacerbated by her mother's tendency to judge her daughters based on their utility rather than nurturing their emotional needs, leaving Connie feeling emotionally neglected and vulnerable.

Furthermore, Connie's father's preoccupation with work results in him neglecting his daughters, contributing to Connie's susceptibility. Her sheltered upbringing and limited social exposure render her inexperienced and naive, making her an easy target for Arnold's predatory advances. The absence of moral fortitude and coping mechanisms in Connie's upbringing leaves her defenseless against Arnold's intimidation tactics.

As the story progresses, Connie's innate innocence and lack of worldly knowledge become apparent as she ultimately chooses to leave with Arnold. Her sheltered social life and deficient moral grounding leave her unprepared to confront the evil represented by Arnold. Connie's submission to Arnold's will can be attributed to her family's failure in providing her with the necessary tools to navigate such dangerous situations.

In essence, Connie's character arc in "Where Are You Going, Where Have You Been?" highlights the detrimental effects of emotional neglect, lack of moral education, and social inexperience. These factors converge to shape Connie into a vulnerable individual who ultimately succumbs to evil due to her family's shortcomings. Slimp's narrative underscores the importance of a solid moral foundation and emotional support in safeguarding individuals against the perils of the world, as demonstrated through Connie's tragic yet cautionary tale.
