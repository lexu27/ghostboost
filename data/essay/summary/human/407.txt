The black leather tote discussed in the essay is specifically designed to cater to the needs of busy mothers seeking both style and organization in their daily errands and family activities. The target audience, known for their penchant for luxury brands such as Chanel, Pucci, and Kate Shade, places a high value on quality that aligns with the price point of the product they are purchasing. By utilizing high-quality leather materials and incorporating extra pockets for added functionality, the tote can effectively justify its high-end price tag.

Survey results highlighted in the essay reveal that there is a significant preference among consumers for shoulder or tote bags that come equipped with extra features like an additional shoulder strap. Moreover, the majority of participants expressed a desire to own a single, versatile bag that can effortlessly transition across various occasions, eliminating the need for multiple bags in their collection.

The recommended product, a 9x11 black leather tote with a production cost of $36, falls within the target audience's budget range of $300 to $700. Given their inclination towards online shopping for handbags, pricing the tote at around $250 presents an opportunity to appeal to the mid-range market segment while still justifying the quality and craftsmanship of the product.

Setting the price point at $250 not only makes the tote more accessible to a wider range of consumers but also has the potential to generate additional revenue for the company. This, in turn, can be reinvested to further enhance the quality of accessories and packaging provided with the tote, ultimately solidifying its position as a desirable and practical choice for fashionable yet functional consumers.
