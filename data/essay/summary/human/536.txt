In Franz Kafka's "The Metamorphosis," the protagonist Gregor Samsa undergoes a profound transformation into a bug, leading to his isolation in his own room. The story unfolds with Gregor's family, who had never been particularly affectionate towards him, growing increasingly cold and cruel following his metamorphosis. Before his change, Gregor was tolerated as the primary breadwinner of the family, but the dynamics shifted drastically after his transformation, revealing his family's deep-seated resentment.

Among his family members, his sister Grete initially assists him out of pity, but as time progresses, she too loses sympathy and ultimately desires his removal from the household. Mrs. Samsa, Gregor's mother, demonstrates emotional distress and attempts to provide comfort to her son, yet she finds it challenging to even look at his bug-like form. On the other hand, Mr. Samsa, Gregor's father, turns abusive towards him as Gregor's inability to work threatens the family's financial stability.

The climax of the story occurs when Gregor's father injures him with fruit, causing a severe illness that accelerates Gregor's decline. In response to the situation, the family members are compelled to take up jobs to support themselves without Gregor's contribution. Faced with the harsh reality of his condition and the burden he has become to his family, Gregor ultimately concludes that his death is the only means to release his loved ones from the plight he embodies.

Symbolically, Gregor's metamorphosis represents his deep yearning for liberation from the overwhelming responsibilities that have defined his existence and his growing resentment towards the exploitative nature of his family relationships. Through Gregor's transformation and eventual demise, Kafka delves into themes of alienation, sacrifice, and the complexities of familial bonds, crafting a narrative that challenges readers to contemplate the nature of identity, duty, and freedom amidst a backdrop of surrealistic turmoil.
