The social determinants of health play a crucial role in shaping individuals' well-being by encompassing the environmental conditions in which they live. These factors go beyond merely biological aspects and access to healthcare, extending to resources that enhance their quality of life. Resources such as safe housing, education, access to healthy food, and emergency services have a profound impact on population health outcomes. It is increasingly recognized that individuals are not solely responsible for their health as external influences wield significant power in shaping choices that affect well-being. Marketing strategies, government policies, work pressures, and life circumstances all contribute to health decisions, emphasizing the need to consider a broader spectrum of influences. Health disparities, especially those rooted in racial and ethnic differences, are significant concerns that underscore the importance of addressing inequalities in healthcare. Eradicating racism within the healthcare system is vital not only for ensuring equal treatment but also for improving overall health outcomes for all individuals. By acknowledging and addressing these external factors and inequalities, society can work towards a more equitable and healthier future for everyone.
