Fairy tales, especially those penned by the esteemed Grimm Brothers, serve not only as captivating stories but also as carriers of hidden messages that can significantly influence children's perceptions and social relationships. Despite undergoing revisions over time, these fairy tales often perpetuate discriminatory gender roles and societal norms through their intricate reward and punishment systems. It is crucial to foster critical thinking skills in children to help them analyze and discuss fairy tales, enabling them to reevaluate stereotypes and opinions ingrained by these narratives. By developing critical thinking abilities early on, we can mitigate the enduring impact fairy tales may have on shaping children's personalities.

Research endeavors aim to delve into the impact of Grimms' fairy tales on children's reality perception and determine whether engaging in critical thinking exercises can alter their judgments on prevalent social norms. Fairy tales are deeply ingrained in children's literature, passed down through generations, rich with elements of magic and fantastical creatures that capture young minds. The Grimm Brothers collected these tales not only to preserve German oral traditions but also to honor stories from diverse cultures, enriching the tapestry of human narratives.

Critical thinking is a skill that transcends fairy tales; it enhances learning, decision-making, and ethical judgment, making it a vital attribute to cultivate early on through educational practices. Previous studies have demonstrated that fairy tales play a pivotal role in helping children reflect on stereotypes and gendered content, equipping them with the resilience needed to navigate future challenges. Through the exploration of fairy tales, children can engage in cognitive development, refining their ability to make ethical decisions and understand their social responsibilities, laying a robust foundation for their holistic growth and development.
