Price bundling is a retail strategy that serves various purposes in boosting sales and customer loyalty. This approach involves grouping multiple products together and selling them at a higher margin but with an overall discount for customers. By offering these bundled packages at a lower price compared to individual purchases, retailers can effectively influence customer behavior and encourage larger transactions. Customers are naturally drawn to bundled deals, especially when the included items are all desirable. This practice is prevalent in the food industry, commonly observed in major fast-food chains such as McDonaldâ€™s, Burger King, and KFC. These chains entice customers with combo meals that present a more economical choice than buying each item separately. Price bundling exemplifies how strategic pricing methods can not only drive sales but also foster customer satisfaction and loyalty.
