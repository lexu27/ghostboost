The debate surrounding wealth distribution in the United States has sparked discussions on the perceived injustices in how different occupations are compensated. The current landscape highlights disparities where some professions are deemed underpaid while others are seen as overpaid. For instance, registered nurses, who carry a high level of responsibility for patients' well-being in healthcare settings, are often considered underpaid despite the critical role they play in the well-being of society. On the other hand, National Football League (NFL) players are viewed as overpaid, especially in light of the escalating profits of renowned clubs and the widespread accessibility of football matches.

These examples are carefully chosen to underscore the importance of aligning compensation with the societal significance of the work being performed. The ethical framework of utilitarianism is often referenced to justify these selections, emphasizing the need for actions that maximize overall well-being and happiness for a significant number of individuals. The essay delves into the potential consequences of the absence of registered nurses and NFL players in their respective fields. While the lack of RNs could lead to detrimental outcomes in healthcare delivery, the impact of NFL players' absence would primarily affect the realm of entertainment.

Proposed solutions to address the perceived injustices in wealth distribution include advocating for measures to limit NFL players' exorbitant wages through petitions or implementing new taxes on occupations deemed as overcompensated. Additionally, suggestions such as enforcing rules that require sports organizations to donate a portion of their profits to philanthropic causes are put forward as a way to tackle the issue. Furthermore, there is a call to action for legislative interventions aimed at raising the minimum wages for registered nurses to rectify the wealth distribution discrepancy.

In conclusion, the essay sheds light on the complexities of wealth distribution patterns in the U.S. and highlights the importance of aligning compensation with the social importance of various occupations. By considering utilitarian ethics and proposing viable solutions, there is a pathway towards addressing the perceived injustices and creating a more equitable system of wealth distribution.
