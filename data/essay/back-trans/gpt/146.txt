Chronic inflammation is a persistent disease that affects a wide range of people with various diseases, including kidney disease in the final stage (ESRD) and those that undergo dialysis treatment.Chronic inflammation in people with ESRD, the effects of this disease on the clinical results and the role of medium molecules in the development of pathology.
The article identifies several main causes of chronic inflammation in people with ESRD. One of the primary causes is the structure of medium molecules in the bloodstream. This medium molecules are the by -products of incomplete metabolism of larger molecules in the body. In the case of people with ESRD, the inability of the kidneys leadEffectively filtering these average molecules, to their accumulation, which leads to chronic inflammation.at.
The effects of chronic inflammation on the clinical results are significant for people with kidney failure in the final stage. Studies have shown that chronic inflammation with increased cardiovascular mortality, immune function and malnutrition in these patients has been determined that high inflammatory markers such as C was stated-Reactive protein are independent predictors for poor clinical results for ESRD people.
Middle molecules, especially β2 microglobulin, were connected to the development of the pathology, which is associated with ESRD.β2 microglobulin in different tissues, including the joints, which leads to the development of a dialysis -related amyloidosis. This state causes joint pain, stiffness and swelling, which further affects the quality of life of ESRD patients.
However, recent breakthroughs and research on dialysis have aimed to stabilize the condition and relieve chronic inflammation in ESRD patients. The hemodiafiltration, a modified form of conventional dialysis, has shown promising results for reducing chronic inflammation and improving clinical results.This technique effectively eliminates medium molecules from the bloodstream, which reduces the inflammatory reaction.
In summary, the chronic inflammation has a significant effect on people with kidney diseases in the end stage and people undergoing dialysis. The article illuminates the main causes of chronic inflammation and emphasizes the role of medium molecules and oxidative stress.However, the clinical results and the development of a dialysis -related amyloidosis. However, the latest breakthroughs and research results for dialysis offer hope to stabilize the condition. An effective removal of medium molecules and technological advances can reduce chronic inflammation and improve clinical results in people with ESRD.
