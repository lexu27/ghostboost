To analyze this situation, we will look at the utilitarian and Kantian morality theories and ultimately determine which perspective is more logical to determine the morality of the actions of the perpetrator.
Utilitarianism is a moral theory that emphasizes the greatest overall happiness for the largest number of people. In terms of utilitarist perspective, the perpetrators' actions would be considered immoral because they damage the customer and potentially other customers who could eat contaminated foods.If the negative consequences caused by contamination, such as the call of the restaurant and the potential legal effects, the general happiness of different stakeholders were disadvantageous.
On the other hand, the Kantian moral theory focuses on the inherent moral value of an action and follows the principle of treatment of individuals as targeted themselves and not as a mere means to the purpose. According to Kantian ethics, the actions of the perpetrator would also be considered immoral.Certainly contaminated the food of the customer, he treated the customer exclusively as a means of carrying out his personal Vendendta, and ignored the inherent value of the customer and the right to be treated with respect. From the Kantian perspective, the action was unethical and violated the basic principlesthe treatment of others than autonomous individuals.
In view of both perspectives, it is obvious that the actions of the perpetrator were morally wrong. In the determination of the perspective in determining the morality of the actions of the perpetrator, the utilitarian perspective seems to offer a more sensible analysis.Utilitarianism takes into account the general happiness of all those involved in the situation. The consideration of the consequences of contamination such as damage to customers, calls of the restaurant and potential legal effects provides a more broad and integrative assessment of the moral effects of the actions.
In addition, in contrast to Kantian ethics, utilitarianism enables the consequences of action and offers a more practical and realistic approach for moral decisions. During the Kantian ethics, the inherent value of individuals and the respect they deserve can be the broader effectsdo not fully take into account an action on society as a whole.
In summary, the incident in the Chicago Hot Dog Restaurant is an ethical problem that can be analyzed by the utilitarian and Kantic morality.the assessment of the morality of the actions of the perpetrator due to the consideration of general happiness and the consequences for everyone involved.
