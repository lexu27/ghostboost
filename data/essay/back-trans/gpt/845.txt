One of the main differences in the gender theories when explaining behavioral problems in men is the nature and nursing debate. An argument that men biologically preach for certain behavioral problems due to their genetic make -up. For example, evolutionary psychologists suggest that aggressive behavior in menis due to their original instinct for dominance and competition. On the other hand, socio -cultural theorists emphasize the effects of socialization and cultural expectations. They argue that gender roles and social norms determine specific standards for masculinity, which for the development of behavioral problems such as aggression or emotional repression in mencan lead.
Another difference is the emphasis on the role of masculinity. Psychodynamic theorists suggest that men have more pressure to correspond to traditional male norms that can cause internal conflicts and behavioral problems.Harmful behaviors refer to rigid social expectations of men. This is what the importance of the challenging and newly defined traditional ideas of masculinity emphasize in order to promote healthier behavioral development in men.
