The representation of women in the film was often criticized for strengthening traditional gender roles and maintaining the dominance patterns between men and women. Two films that provide significant examples are "the postman always rings twice" and "The Dark Knight Rises".Due to the lens of male view theory and psychoanalysis, it becomes clear how the limits imposed by the family in the melodramgen genre occur into these dominance patterns.
The male viewing theory characterized by Laura Mulvey argues that the view of the camera in Mainstream films, which are mainly controlled by male directors, tends to objectify women as passive objects for the desire for male spectators., where Cora, the female leading role, is consistently framed and shot in a way that emphasizes her sexual attraction. The camera often lingeres at her curves and emphasizes her body as an object of desire.Cora is used to manipulate and control them.
Psychoanalysis also plays a role in restricting women in the film. The theories of Sigmund Freud suggest that women are caught by cultural expectations, especially within the family structure.However, it is later shown that she is only a farmer in the plan of the male antagonist Bane. The final purpose in the narrative is to fulfill the role of a subordinate woman who accepts her predetermined position under male rule.
The melodrama genre, which is characterized by its emphasis on family dynamics and emotional vulnerability, increases these restrictions. "The Postman always rings twice", Coras marriage limits her agency and puts on a submissive position.Similarly, the family dynamics between Miranda and her father in "The Dark Knight Rises" contribute to their later submission to male dominance.
By examining the presentation of women in the film through the concepts of male view theory and psychoanalysis, it becomes clear how the limits imposed by the family in the melodrama genre reinforce the dominance patterns between men and women."And" The Dark Knight Rises "underline the objectification and subordination of women and presence the unequal dynamics of performance between gender, which were maintained by the mainstream cinema.To strive for women in the film.
