Language studies as a discipline are constantly developing and have been addressed in different ways over the years. Prominent methods used in language studies are the prescriptive and descriptive approaches. The prescribed approach focuses on the determination and enforcement of rules for language use, while the descriptive approach describes the actual use of the language in a certain language community. The combination of these approaches can achieve a more comprehensive understanding of the language, and misunderstandings in terms of language change can be addressed.
The prescribed approach for language studies aims to prescribe the correct language use on the basis of defined rules and norms.of these rules are considered to be mistakes.
On the other hand, the descriptive approach focuses on observation and analysis of the actual use of language in a language community.considered "correct" or "wrong", more by use than by the arbitrary rules. Describing linguists collect data about field work, interviews and surveys to provide insights into the dynamic nature of the language.
Both approaches have their merits and restrictions. The prescribed approach contains a standardized series of rules that can be useful in formal contexts such as academic writing or legal documents.Often influenced by social prejudices and may not reflect the diverse spectrum of language practices in various language communities.
The descriptive approach, on the other hand, recognizes the dynamic nature of the language and includes the linguistic diversity.Effective communication in certain contexts is required.
The combination of both approaches can achieve a more comprehensive understanding of the language. Prescribing rules can be informed by descriptive observations to ensure that they reflect the natural use of the language.and stand up to standardization. Linguists can try to increase a balance between the two approaches and to recognize that rules should not suffocate or marginalize language development or certain language communities.
Combating misunderstandings in connection with language change is an essential aspect of a comprehensive approach for language studies. Many people have the misunderstanding that language change indicates a linguistic decline or deterioration.History has occurred. It is an inherent feature of a living language and reflects the adaptability and creativity of human communication.
In order to address these misunderstandings, linguists can inform the public about the type of language change and its importance. You can emphasize that language change does not mean that earlier language forms are more likely or more correct.And new linguistic forms arise to take these changes into account.
In summary, it can be said that a comprehensive understanding of the language can be achieved by combining the prescriptive and descriptive approaches for language studies.Wealth and diversity of human communication appreciate.
