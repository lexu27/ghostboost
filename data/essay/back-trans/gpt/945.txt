Mukoviscidosis (CF) is an inherited genetic disorder that mainly affects the lungs and digestive system.The clinical manifestations, the interdisciplinary approach to treatment and care responsibility in the treatment of cystic fibrosis discusses.
The pathophysiology of CF contains a defect in the CFTR -protein. Normally, the CFTR protein regulates the movement of chloridions over cell membranes. In CF, the defective CFTR protein leads to an impaired chloride transport, which is to produce thick, sticky mucus in the airwaysand other organs leads. The accumulation of mucus hinders the respiratory tract and causes recurring lung infections and progressive lung damage.
However, the clinical manifestations of CF vary primarily to include breathing and stomach symptoms..Cf can also influence other organs such as liver, reproductive system and sweat glands.
The treatment of CF requires an interdisciplinary approach in which various members of the health professions are involved. A key member of the health team is a pulmonary doctor who specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of respiratory diseases. The pulmonologist is related to the assessment and treatment of complicationsResponsible with lungs, including the administration of bronchodilators, antibiotics for the treatment of infections and physiotherapy to extinguish mucus from the airways. A gastroenterologist is also essential for the treatment of CF, since it is concerned with the nutritional and digestive aspects of the disease.
An essential aspect of CF treatment is the promotion of respiratory release. This is achieved through various techniques such as breast physiotherapy, training and use of devices such as positive expiration pressure (PEP) and high -frequency breast wall vibration (HFCWO).To loosen and mobilize mucus. Movement can also help to improve the airways by promoting the cough reflex.Pep- and HFCWO devices provide the airways positive pressure and contribute to the larger airways for the expansionmove.
Nutrition management is another crucial part of the CF treatment. In the way of the paint absorption, people with CF need a high-calorie, protein-rich diet. This often includes pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy to support digestion and fat-soluble vitamin supplements. A registered nutritional consultant plays an importantRole in advising CF patients and their families with a suitable diet, monitoring growth and adapting the nutritional interventions as required.
Nurses play an important role in the care of CF patients by offering direct care, raising patients and their families and coordinating the care across disciplines.The implementation of respiratory tract -Clearance techniques.
In summary, cystic fibrosis is a complex genetic disturbance, which is characterized by an abnormal chloridion transport, which leads to the production of thick, sticky mucus. This mucus affects the breathing and gastrointestinal systems, which leads to a number of clinical manifestations.CF treatment requires an interdisciplinary approach in which pulmonologists, gastroenterologists, nutritionists and other members of the health professions are involved. Hospital sisters play a decisive role in the care of CF patients and offer direct care, education and coordination of care.Pathophysiology and clinical manifestations of CF as well as the interdisciplinary approach for treatment and care responsibility can offer members of the health professions a comprehensive and effective care of people who live with this chronic state.
