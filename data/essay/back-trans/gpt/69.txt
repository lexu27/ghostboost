Logic is a fundamental branch of philosophy that has undergone considerable development over the centuries. In his origins in Aristotle work, logic has developed into two main branches: philosophical logic and mathematical or modern logic.discussed from Aristotle to modern times, whereby the focus is on the transition between these two branches, analyzes the differences between them and takes into account the advantages and disadvantages of each approach.
Aristotle, often referred to as the father of logic, laid the foundation for philosophical logic.The basis for logical thinking. The philosophical logic has developed over the centuries, with contributions from thinker like Gottlob Frege, Bertrand Russell and Ludwig Wittgenstein. This logic branch is primarily focused on the semantics and importance of statements, for insights into natureto give reality and knowledge.
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries there was a significant shift in logic development with the development of mathematical logic..Mathematical logic uses symbols, formulas and formal languages ​​to express arguments and evidence. Mathematical techniques such as defined theory and formal systems introduced it and made it possible to objectively analyze logical statements.
The transition from the philosophical logic to mathematical logic brought several advantages. The mathematical approach enabled precise deductions and formal evidence, which made arguments clearer and less susceptible to ambiguities..
However, mathematical logic also has its disadvantages. The focus on formalism and symbolism can sometimes remove from its philosophical roots and reduces the consideration of meanings and concepts.Include ambiguity such as ethics or linguistics.
In summary, the logic of the syllogism of Aristotle has developed into its modern forms of philosophical logic and mathematical logic. During the philosophical logic, the meaning and semantics of statements emphasize mathematical logic mathematical strict and formalism in logical thinking.- and disadvantages. The philosophical logic provides insights into the nature of reality, knowledge and meaning, while the mathematical logic offers precision, objectivity and arithmetic.
