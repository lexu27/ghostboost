The insertion of different racist and ethnic groups against each other prevents coalitions that are necessary to assume and reduce structural racism.If he promotes the guilt and scapegoat and draws attention from the real causes of inequality. McGhee offers an example of the construction of highways that deliberately divides black neighborhoods, which leads to the deprivation of resources and opportunities for these communities.Cycle of the racial layout and prevents progress in the direction of a fairer society.
Finally, the zero -sum paradigm undermines social trust and cohesion.How to tackle climate change and economic inequality.
In summary, it can be said that Heather McGhe's analysis of the negative effects of the zero -sum paradigm illuminates on its adverse effects on the USA. The continuation of the competition for cooperation, the racial departments and the eroding of social trust hinder progress and hinders the striving for strivingAccording to a fairer society. The recognition of these negative effects is crucial to go to a paradigm that evaluates the common prosperity and promotes the recording for everyone.
