The oil pollution from Deepwater Horizon, also known as BP oil pollution, was an environmental disaster that had a significant impact on the Gulf of Mexico and its surrounding communities. As is subject to the management decisions made by BP.Utilitarianism, an ethical theory that focuses on maximizing general happiness or the advantages of all those involved, we examine the ethical evaluation of the decisions of the Spill management of BP.
Utilitarianism is of the opinion that an action is morally correct if it causes the greatest number of people to give the greatest number of people.to minimize the local communities and their own employees.
From a utilitarian point of view, BPS can be considered ethically questionable.The advantages that BP have gained negative effects on these stakeholders through the cost reduction or bypass of security measures.
However, when the crisis unfolded, BP took steps to correct the situation and compensate for the affected stakeholders.A shift in the direction of a more utilitarian attitude by prioritizing the overall result and the advantages of all those involved.
However, it is important to note that utilitarianism can also be criticized because of its potential to overlook the rights and interests of certain individuals or groups. In the case of BP, their decisions on the burial management may still have harmful stakeholders such as the fishing and wildlife populations,The long -term effects of the bureau continue to suffer. From this perspective, the utilitarian evaluation of the decision -making of BP may not fully grasp the ethical complexity of the situation.
In summary, it can be said that the ethical assessment of the decisions of BP's burial management by the lens of utilitarianism underlines the need to take into account the overall result and the advantages of all those involved.Had, their subsequent actions showed a careful shift to a more utilitarian approach, but it is crucial to recognize the limits of utilitarianism and to take into account the rights and interests of certain people or groups that may have been overlooked.
