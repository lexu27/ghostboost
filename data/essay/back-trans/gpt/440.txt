The aging process is a complex phenomenon that affects all living organisms, including human brain.However, stem cell research, however, has opened new opportunities for slowing down or even standing in the brain to a standstill by the use of neuronal stem cells.
Neural stem cells are a unique type of stem cells that are able to differentiate in different types of cells that are found in the brain, such as neurons and glial cells. This ability makes them a promising candidate for therapeutic applications in slowing down orDisorder of the aging process in the brain.
One of the key factors that hinder the healing and regeneration of the brain tissue is the complexity and limited capacity of the self -repair. In contrast to other organs in the body such as liver or skin, the brain has a limited ability to regenerate and replace damaged cells.This is mainly due to the complicated network of connections between neurons and the sensitive balance of neurotransmitter, which are required for proper brain function.
However, neuronal stem cells have shown the potential to replace and differentiate neurons and other brain cells, which offers the possibility to repair damaged or lost tissue. This process is regulated by various signal molecules and transcription factors that control the differentiation of neural stem cells into specific cell types.
The ventricular subventriculation zone (VZ-SVZ) and the subgranular zone (SGZ) are two regions in the adult brain that are known that they have neural stem cells. The VZ-SVZ is located along the walls of the lateral ventricles, while the SGZ imDental gyrus of the hippocampus occurs. This regions play a crucial role in neurogenesis, the process of creating new neurons in the adult brain.
Numerous studies have examined the regulation and differentiation of neuronal stem cells in these regions. For example, studies have shown that certain signal molecules such as sound hedgehogs and WNT proteins are important to maintain self-renewal and proliferation of neuronal stem cells.involved in the differentiation of neural stem cells into certain cell types.
Various therapeutic approaches were proposed to use neural stem cells to slow down or stop the aging process in the brain. The transplantation of exogenous neural stem cells in the brain includes the brain to replace damaged or lost cells.improves the cognitive function and delayed the beginning of neurodegenerative diseases in animal models.
Another approach includes the activation of endogenous neural stem cells in the brain by using growth factors or small molecules. It has been shown that this increases neurogenesis and brain function improves in various experimental models.
In summary, the potential therapeutic applications of neuronal stem cells to slow down or disrupt the aging process in the brain are promising. Dive of complexity and limited capacity to heal and regeneration of brain tissue have shown neural stem cells to replace neurons and other cells of the brain and in other cellsdifferentiate. The regulation and differentiation of neuronal stem cells in the ventricular subsidiary zone and the subgranular zone has been examined in detail in the literature. Different therapeutic approaches such as the transplantation and activation of endogenous neural stem cells have shown a rejuvenation potential.The differentiation and integration of neural stem cells into the aging brain are fully understood.
