Introduction (100 words):
The Spongiborm -Encephalopathy (BSE), which is generally referred to as the "crazy cow disease", became a significant concern of public health at the end of the 20th century.Control measures in the beef industry led. However, subsequent evidence showed the potential transfer of BSE to humans by taking contaminated meat.the safety of meat consumption.
Body:
1. Background to BSE and its transmission (200 words):
BSE is a neurodegenerative disease that affects cattle and is characterized by the accumulation of abnormal prion proteins in the brain. It was first identified in the United Kingdom in the 1980s and quickly spread to an epidemic.Feeding of rendered meat-and-bone flour with infected tissue comes to cattle and the gearbox is reinforced by the cattle food chain.
2. Potential transmission to humans (200 words):
The most important concern of the BSE is the potential transmission to humans through the use of contaminated meat products.Contrary to the classic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), VCJD has a longer incubation period and manifests itself with different clinical and pathological features. Several cases have been reported worldwide by VCJD, the majority being connected to BSE epidemics in Great Britain.
3. Effects of the transfer and effects on public health (200 words):
The transfer of BSE to humans is mainly by taking BSE infected neural tissue that are available in meat products.People are often not aware of the origin of the meat they consumed, there is a considerable risk of taking contaminated materials.
The effects on public health are significant, mainly due to the potential for a large outbreak of VCJD.Carriers continue to identify and control the disease.
4. Security measures and prevention (200 words):
In order to alleviate the risk of a BSE transmission, various security measures have been implemented worldwide.It is crucial to enforce the proper labeling and traceability of meat products.
Conclusion (100 words):
The potential transfer of BSE to humans by taking contaminated meat has a significant impact on public health.Food security, the implementation of strict surveillance systems and the increase in public can respond to the minimization of the risk of a BSE transmission and to ensure the safety of meat consumption.
