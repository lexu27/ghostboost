Søren Kierkegaard's work "fear and trembling" represents a stimulating challenge for conventional ideas of faith and morality. As a result of his research into the history of Abraham's almost obtaining his son Isaac, Kierkegaard challenges the traditional understanding of what it means, faithful and moralBeing to be.
One possibility of how "fear and tremors" question conventional ideas of faith is the emphasis on the relationship of the individual to God.He argues that Abraham's willingness to sacrifice his son is a act of faith that opposed all moral conventions of the time.True faith and morality are deeply personal and can even defy the established norms.
In addition, Kierkegaard's work requires the idea that the moral duty can easily be reconciled with religious faith. He claims that true faith is often necessary by people to make decisions that can contradict conventional moral valuesHistory of Abraham does not apply to ordinary standards, but it is viewed as a manifestation of Abraham's extraordinary faith and obedience to God.that belief can sometimes demand actions that overcome conventional moral boundaries.
Kierkegaard also calls for the concept of religious certainty and the requirement of evidence or rational justification in question of faith.Question that belief is rational and can be completely explained or justified.
In summary, it can be said that Søren Kierkegaard's "fear and trembling" conventional ideas of faith and morality, by emphasizing the personal relationship of the individual to God, questions the potential conflict between duty and personal beliefs and the paradoxical nature of faith.His research into the history of Abraham encourages Kierkegaard to question and re -evaluate the readers of questioning and re -evaluate the preliminary ideas of faith and morality, and asked them to think critically about the complexity of their own beliefs and actions.
