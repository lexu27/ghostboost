Body:
1. Differentiation of the severity of the crimes:
The principle of proportionality is on the basis of criminal judicial systems worldwide. It ensures that punishment fits the crime committed. However, if it is about attempted crimes, the question arises: How comparable is the severity of the act of the severity of the intended crime? While attempted crimes are certainly serious crimes, they often contain an element of uncertainty, both with regard to the intention of the accused and the damage they could have caused.
2. Intention and circumstances:
The intention plays a crucial role in the distinction between the two crimes. The actual kidnapping or illegal reluctance of an individual includes their will against their will, which leads to longer fear, trauma and potential damage.However, it includes the inspection of the action, but is thwarted before the crime is completed.
3. The role of deterrent:
An argument that supports equivalent punishments for attempted kidnapping is that it serves as a deterrent against potential criminals. The fear of facing the same serious consequences could prevent people from committing crime.Attempted crime can think twice about potential perpetrators before they act on their criminal intentions. However, the actual daunting effect of such punishments requires an empirical review.

6. Adaptation of the punishment to match the crime:
Instead of equating the punishment for attempted kidnapping with material kidnapping in wholesale, a case-to-case approach can be pursued. Avaping decisions should take into account factors such as the severity of the law, the prehistory of a accused, the existence of intent and general damage potential.This context -based approach enables the judges to impose punishments, which in any case adequately reflect the intention, the danger and damage.
Diploma:
