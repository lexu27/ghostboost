During the environment, it is not successful and appeals to a contemporary audience, it is not to be researched,to completely research the complexity of love, fate and violence.
One of the remarkable strengths of the new adaptation is its fresh and modern environment, which enables the topics to find today's audience. The transmission of the Feels Montagues and Capulets into a busy city into the competing street bands creates a lively and reliable backgroundFor the timeless topics of history. This transition enables contemporary topics such as gang violence, social inequality and the power of love to overcome social obstacles.
In addition, the new adaptation captivates the passionate love between Romeo and Julia.The over -marketing nature of young love, a central topic in the original piece.
However, the adaptation also has weaknesses that hinder their ability to fully grasp the profound topics of Shakespeare's work. A major weakness is the neglect of the role of fate. In the original piece, fate plays an important role in the tragic end of Romeo and Julia,And her death is considered an inevitable consequence of the stars.
In addition, the film cannot fully research the consequences of violence. The fight between the competing gangs lacks the emotional weight and the consequences in the original piece. In the following, the destructive nature of violence, which is based on the tragedy of history, is not adequately presented.This dilution of violence weakens the general influence of adaptation and reduces the importance of the topic.
In summary, it can be said that the new adaptation of "Romeo and Julia" has the attitude and appealing attraction to a contemporary audience, but it falls short to grasp the full depth and complexity of the topics of the original game.The diluted representation of violence weakens the ability of adaptation to convey the profound topics of love, fate and violence, which is so masterfully created.
