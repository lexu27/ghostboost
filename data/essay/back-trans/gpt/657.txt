One of the immediate effects of the Russian invasion is the disturbance of the global supply chain. With the annexation of Russia and the subsequent military actions, care lines are disturbed, which leads to bottlenecks and increasing prices for essential goods.Example has suffered a lot of Ukraine, a great exporter of agricultural products, their agricultural sector from the invasion. Since global manufacturing processes are increasingly based on complex and integrated supply chains in several countries, any disorder in a region can have a domino effect on the entire chainThis leads to delays in production, increased costs and a decline in total management.
