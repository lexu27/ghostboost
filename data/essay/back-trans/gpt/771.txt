In many countries, their borders were closed and road traffic restricted, while the maritime operations were also severely impaired.Advantages for delays and logistical complications and disabled their timely delivery to the needy areas.
In order to improve the delivery of medical devices and stocks during such crises, a comprehensive solution is required.

The states can quickly access significant medical care during emergencies during emergencies.a diversified network of suppliers and manufacturers mitigate disorders caused by localized outbursts or global crises.
In summary, Covid-19 pandemic has emphasized the weaknesses of supply chain and transport systems, in particular in the delivery of medical devices and supplies.We can improve solutions to the resistance of our supply chains and ensure the efficient delivery of medical devices and supply to the needy in future crises.
