Despite its principle of fairness and impartiality, the controversial criminal justice system has long been plagued by ethical problems that represent important challenges for the achievement of justice. A problem is the perception of bias in favor of the accused, which is concerned with regard to the potential effects on the racial difference withinof the American judicial system. The latest report by the United States Judding Commission illuminates these questions and provides decisive evidence of the analysis and understanding of the ethical problems associated with this system.
An ethical concern is the question of fairness and the same protection according to the law. The procedural security in the controversial system such as the presumption of innocence and the burden of proof for law enforcement should ensure that individuals are not wrongly condemned. Howeveroffer that the scales can give in their favor, especially if they are associated with factors such as socio -economic status and access to resources.History of racon is shaped to be biased.
The United Statesuring Commission's report underlines the existence of differences in the judicial system, especially when it comes to drug -related offenses. The report shows that African -American defendants receive longer sentences than their white colleagues for similar crimes and increase concerns about racist distortion within the system.This raises ethical problems because it indicates that certain people do not receive equal treatment and are disproportionately influenced by the criminal justice system.
In addition, the racial differences, which are brought to light by the report, underline the existence of systemic racism within the American judicial system. This systemic problem is a product of various factors, including law enforcement authorities, social distortions and implicit racial stereotypes.To ensure fairness, accidentally maintain these differences.
The treatment of the ethical problems of the controversial punitive justice system and its effects on the racial differences requires a wide range of approaches.Promotion of fairness can include the implementation of guidelines for mandatory convictions, the combating of the racial profile and the distortion of the law enforcement authorities, the provision of adequate resources for defense in indigenous cases as well as the promotion of education and consciousness for racial differences within the system.
In summary, it can be said that the controversial criminal justice system with its perceived distortion in favor of the accused has significant ethical problems.It is essential to confront these ethical concerns and to go to a fairer and fair criminal justice system that maintains the principles of fairness, impartiality and the same protection according to the law for all persons, regardless of their breed or their socio -economic status.
