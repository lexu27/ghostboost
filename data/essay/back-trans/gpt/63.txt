Adorno argues that these products such as children's television shows and films are created by children with the sole purpose of achieving profit for companies.To become a passive consumer.
An outstanding example of media products that reinforce capitalist values ​​can be seen in the enormous amount of goods that are connected to the popular children's franchise companies.Income from the health insurers is a wide range of goods, including toys, clothing and accessories. This products should not only maintain children, but also create the demand for consumer goods. The media play an important role in the design of wishes and preferencesConsumer culture intentionally promote children and consumer culture.

After this approach, these products fulfill the development and educational needs of children and offer them entertaining and informative content. For exampleThe ability to promote learning and social development in children.
While structural functionalism recognizes the influence of capitalism on media production, it prioritizes the positive social contributions of these media products. This perspective usually focuses on the potential advantages for the growth of children and the promotion of social cohesion.

Examples such as the promotional articles in connection with popular children's franchise companies emphasize the materialistic nature that are based on these products. However, the perspective of structural functionalism offers oneMore optimistic view and emphasizes the pedagogical and uniform aspects of media products.
