Allergic rhinitis is an immune -mediated hypersensitivity reaction that is triggered by exposure to allergens such as pollen, dust mites, pet -dander or mold spores. In the exposure, the IGE cells bound to mast cells recognize allergens and lead to the release of inflammatory mediators such as Histamine, leukotria and cytocines.Histamine is responsible for the immediate symptoms of rhinorrhea, nasal deflection, itching and sneezing, while leukotria and cytokines contribute to the late phases of allergic reaction, which leads to continued inflammation and nasal staunts.

Tadine alleviate rapid relief from nasal symptoms by histamine receptors inthe nasal mucosa are blocked. Intranasal corticosteroids such as fluticasone and budesonide reduce nasal inflammation, congestion and sneezing by suppression of the release of inflammatory mediators. Systemic antihistamins and leukotria receptor antagonists are used for patients with more severe symptoms or as additional therapy if primary treatments are not sufficient.
Apart from pharmacological interventions, environmental control measures play a crucial role in the treatment of allergic rhinitis.The window to prevent the entry of allergens. Regular cleaning, vacuuming and damp dust craze can also reduce interior allergen mirrors.
The effectiveness of these treatment options varies depending on the individual patient and the severity of their symptoms.Preventing the disease. Intranasal antihistamines are also effective and can be preferred by patients due to their rapid use of the effect. Environment control measures are essential, but may not offer complete symptom relief, especially for people with severe allergies or in areas with high allergen exposure.
In summary, allergic rhinitis is a frequent allergic disease characterized by inflammation of the nasal mucosa in response to allergen exposure.During the physical examination, helps with the diagnosis of allergic rhinitis. Effective management includes pharmacological interventions such as intranasal antihistamines and corticosteroids as well as environmental control measures and nasal heating.Successful treatment of allergic rhinitis of crucial importance.
