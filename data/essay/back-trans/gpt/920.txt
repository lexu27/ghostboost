Synthesis of serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine from her respective forecasters
Serotonin, dopamine and noradrenaline are neurotransmitters with an important role in regulating various physiological and psychological processes in the human body. The synthesis of these neurotransmitters begins with the conversion of their respective forerunner -substances into their active forms.Serotonin, dopamine and noradrenaline are involved, is crucial to understand their importance for our general well -being.
Serotonin, generally known as "happiness hormone", is synthesized from the amino acid tryptophan.-Htp) converted. This enzyme catalyzes the hydroxylation of tryptophan to 5-HTP.Diese reaction is reserved in the synthesis of serotonin.
After the conversion into 5-HTP, the second crucial step with decarboxylation. The enzyme enzyme l-aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) transforms 5-HTP into serotonin. This enzyme removes the carboxyl group from 5-HTP, which leads to the end product serotonin.Serotonin was produced, he interacts with various receptors in the brain and influences mood, appetite, sleep and other physiological functions.
Dopamine, another important neurotransmitter, comes from the amino acid -tyrosine.Tyrosine crosses the blood-brain barrier and entered the neurons through the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase, where it is in L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine)This conversion, similar to the synthesis of serotonin, is in the synthesis of dopamine speed.
The next step is the decarboxylation of L-dopa for the production of dopamine. This procedure is also catalyzed by the aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) from enzyme. After decarboxylation, dopamine interacts with its receptors and plays a crucial role atthe regulation of emotions, movement, motivation and knowledge.
Similarly, the synthesis of noradrenaline begins with the amino acid-tyrosine, the same precursor substance as dopamine.tyrosine is converted into L-dopa by tyrosine hydroxylase, which is the speed-limiting step.converted into dopamine, but the synthesis of noradrenaline diverges at this point of dopamine.
Dopamine, the forerunner of noradrenaline, is accepted by the vesicles in the neurons. In the vesicles, dopamine is converted into noradrenaline by the enzyme dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH).
Once synthesized, noradrenaline acts as a hormone and neurotransmitter and plays a crucial role in regulating blood pressure, stress response and attention. It binds to various adrenergic receptors, which raises its effects on target tissue and influences physiological processes such as vasoconstriction and heart rate.
In summary, the synthesis of serotonin, dopamine and noradrenaline contains a number of enzymatic reactions from her respective forerunner substances. Tryptophan is converted into serotonin, tyrosine is converted into dopamine and dopamine serves as a forerunner for noradrenaline.The regulation of mood, movement, cognitive function and physiological reactions. The understanding of the subtleties associated with their synthesis helps to illuminate their importance in maintaining our general well -being.for the treatment of neurological and psychiatric disorders in connection with the dysregulation of these neurotransmitters.
