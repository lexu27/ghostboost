The implementation of Accountable Care Organizations (ACOS) in the healthcare industry has a significant impact on the costs and quality of the healthcare system. In this essay, the effects of ACOS are discussed on these two factors and evaluates whether the value -oriented payment system is fair for patients.
ACOS are networks of health service providers, including doctors, hospitals and other medical specialists who coordinate the care of a group of patients. The aim of ACOS is to improve the quality of care and at the same time reduce health costs.Achieved value -oriented payment system, in which health service providers are compensated on the basis of the quality of the supply they offer and not of the service volume.
One of the main advantages of ACOS is the potential to reduce health costs. The concentration on preventive care can reduce ACOS the need for expensive treatments and hospitalization.Before they become more serious and more expensive, a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine showed that ACOS reduced the Medicare editions by 1.4% in the first years of operation.
In addition, it was shown that ACOS improve the quality of health care.

The concentration on preventive care and the implementation of the value -oriented payment system can reduce ACOS the costs for health care and improve the results of the patients. During the value -oriented payment system, concerns regarding fairnesscan, the evidence suggests that it promotes a higher quality of care, but it is important to monitor and address potential disadvantages to ensure that the needs of the patient are prioritized.
