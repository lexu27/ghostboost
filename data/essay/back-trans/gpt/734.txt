However, Midgley argues against this term and claims that this approach affects our understanding of different cultures and prevents us from making meaningful ethical reviews.
Midgley emphasizes the mistake of moral isolationism by represents Japanese practice from the 18th century as an example "to try out his new sword". In this practice, samurais were allowed to test their newly forged swords on unsuspecting farmers. Moral isolationism would indicate thisthat this practice should be accepted as a cultural norm without criticism. However, it disagrees and claims that there are universal moral values ​​that can serve as the basis for the evaluation of such practices.The value is that should not be affected by cultural relativism.
Midgley continues to illustrate her criticism of moralolationism with the example of a female genital change (FGM).is embedded in culture, cannot be criticized.
