Reliability is the extent to which a measurement or research technology consistently achieves the same results when repeated.For the achievement of reliability, for example, if a researcher carries out a survey that measures the stress level in a population, it is important that the questions are formulated consistently and the data acquisition process remains the same. Innocal questioning or variations of the data acquisition methods could lead to unreliable results,which weakens the validity of the study.
The consistency of research techniques is also of essential importance for the creation of reliability. The researchers must apply standardized procedures to ensure consistency in all studies. In an experiment that tests the effect of a new drug, it is important, for exampleto follow a standardized protocol, which means that the administration of the drug, the measurement of blood pressure and the data analysis methods are consistent. This consistency enables the results to be compared in various studies and strengthens the reliability of research.
The validity, on the other hand, refers to the accuracy and fact of research data and instruments. It is the extent to which a study measures what it measures. The researchers must ensure that their measurements are precisely presenting the variables of interest.For example, if a study aims to measure job satisfaction, it is absolutely necessary that the measurement tool used records all relevant aspects of job satisfaction. The use of a valid instrument ensures that the results are a real presentation of the examined construct.
In order to determine the validity, researchers can use established measurement tools that have been validated beforehand. If a researcher is interested in depression, for example, he can use a widespread and validated instrument such as the Beck depression inventory. By using such instruments, researchers can ensure,that your data acquisition instruments measure the variables of interest exactly, which leads to valid results.
In addition, the evaluation of the accuracy of research data is of crucial importance. The researchers must critically assess their data recording techniques and data analysis procedures and ensure that all distortions are treated.To ensure or use statistical tests to validate your quantitative measurements. This measures increase confidence in the validity of your results.
In summary, it can be said that reliability and validity in research is of crucial importance, especially when measuring the relationship between independent and dependent variables. The consistency of data and research techniques ensures reliability that enables replications and stable results.As well as the use of validated instruments to determine the validity, the researchers must be hardworking in their approach to ensure that their studies have both reliability and validity in order to achieve robust and credible results.
