Series and friction are two important participants for pressure injuries. Serious occurs when different tissue layers slide on top of each other, which leads to damage to the blood vessels and tissue -fitting.These forces have a harmful effect due to the natural aging process, reduced skin elasticity and the impairment of mobility. The minimization of shear and friction can significantly reduce health service providers to occur of pressure violations.
In order to minimize shear and friction, the health service providers use various interventions such as repositioning techniques, the use of sliding plates and the implementation of low frictional areas. In the new positioning techniques, patients are regularly re -positioned in order to alleviate the pressure on certain areas and the forces exercised on the skinDistribution of patient transmissions are used to minimize friction, while low friction surfaces such as special bed linen and mattresses reduce the risk of injury in longer immobil times.
Several studies have shown the effectiveness of these interventions. A by Bergstrom et al. (1995), in which elderly patients were involved in nursing homes, a significant reduction in pressure injuries after the implementation of a repositioning program showed that the study showed that the repositioningA systematic review of Vanderwee et al. (2007) came to a decrease in the pressure violations by 50% compared to the conventional four -hour protocol.. This results underline the importance of minimizing shear and friction as an effective strategy in reducing pressure violations in the hospital.
Pressure redistribution Surfaces such as specialized mattresses, overlays and pillows are another key component in the prevention of pressure injuries. This interfaces work by reducing the pressure of bony supplies, which reduces the tissue damage and promotes better blood flow., Proper weight distribution and pressure relief for areas in need of protection offer and minimize the risk of pressure violations.
Several studies have shown the effectiveness of pressure redistribution areas. A randomized controlled study by Nixon et al. (2006) compared the use of a high-specific foam mattress with a standard hospital mattress in older patients.. Another study by Defloor et al. (2005) evaluated the effect of alternating pressure mattress in preventing pressure ulcers in older patients. The results showed a significant decrease in pressure ulcers compared to standard hospital mattresses.The effectiveness of pressure distribution areas in reducing pressure injuries in older people in older patients.
In summary, the minimization of shear and friction and the use of pressure distribution areas with pressure redistribution within a year in one year in older patients in older patients can be very effective.and provide better pressure relief and weight distribution. The implementation of repositioning techniques, the use of lubricant leaves and the use of pressure distribution areas can significantly reduce the occurrence of pressure injuries in older population.to maximize their effectiveness and to improve the overall quality of the care of older patients.
