Durkheim believed that these institutions create social norms, values ​​and solidarity that regulate and ensure human behavior. For example, the education system transmits knowledge and skills to future generations, while the family offers emotional support and moralGives values.
On the other hand, Marx 'conflict theory argues that society is characterized by inequality and conflict between different social classes. For Marx, the dominant class in a society, the bourgeoisie, uses the working class or the proletariat by depriving an excess value from its work.This exploitation leads to class struggle, while the proletariat tries to overthrow the bourgeoisie and establish a classless society. Marx believed that social change and progress through revolutionary means and the establishment of a socialist or communist society occur.

Durkheim considered the social change as slow and gradually and occurred through a process of evolution and adaptation. He believed that sudden or drastic changesdisturb social balance and lead to anomy or social resolution. In contrast, Marx saw the social change as a result of conflict and revolution. He argued that social change was necessary to overthrow oppressive systems and create just society.
