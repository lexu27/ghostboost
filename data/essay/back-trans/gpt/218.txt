Many doctors have deeply rooted values ​​that prioritize the holiness of life and believe in their duty to ensure and suffer.Relieve instead of accelerating death. This moral convictions can be significantly questioned if the surveys appear after euthanasia, and the doctors force to make difficult decisions between their principles and the wishes of their patient.

The basic role of doctors is to heal compassionate care and worry.that the relief of death can be part of medical practice. This shift can fundamentally change the leading principles of the profession and possibly reduce the value of human life and the striving for innovative treatments to relieve suffering.
