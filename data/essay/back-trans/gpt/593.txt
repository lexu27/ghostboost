One of the main advantages in implementing a database management system is to improve efficiency. With a digital platform, universities can automate various processes, e.g.For example, the generation and distribution of transcripts, which leads to time and resource savings. This is where a centralized database enables easy access to student data sets and facilitates faster response times for academic and administrative inquiries.to concentrate on teaching and learning.

In summary, it can be said that the implementation of a database management system for student transcripts at universities offers numerous advantages. However, it is important to identify the potential security risks of this technology and take suitable measures in order to protect sensitive student information.The universities optimize efficiency, accessibility and privacy and thus create an environment that is beneficial for learning and growth.
