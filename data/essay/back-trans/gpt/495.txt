A significant approach to the prevention and treatment of pressure ulcers is the use of pressure reduction surfaces. This surfaces should distribute the weight of the body more evenly and reduce the pressure to certain areas that are susceptible to pressure ulcers.and changing pressure mattresses.
Foam mattresses are a frequently used support interface in community environments because they offer reliable pressure redistribution. They consist of foam with high density that corresponds to the shape of the body and reduces the pressure on protective points such as bony previous knowledge.Up to medium risk.
Another effective support surface is the air-fleed bed. In this specialized bed, tiny silicone beads are used, circulate air in the entire mattress and create a liquid environment. This fluid surface reduces the pressure by minimizing the shear and frictional forces on the skin.are particularly advantageous for patients with existing pressure ulcers because they promote wound healing and offer excellent pressure distribution. However, the requirements for installation costs and maintenance work can limit their widespread use in community environments.
Change pressure mattresses are an alternative support interface that uses a number of cells or air bubbles that inflate and empty. This effects that the weight surface is constantly changing and the pressure on certain areas is reduced.Pressure ulcers. They offer effective pressure relief and promote blood circulation, improve healing and prevent further skin breakdown. This mattresses are relatively affordable and easy to use, which means that they are suitable for community environments.
In order to effectively use the pressure reduction interfaces in community environments, it is important to assess the risk of the individual for pressure ulcers and its specific needs. Health professions should carry out comprehensive reviews that take into account factors such as mobility, nutrition and skin integrity. This assessment will contribute to this,to determine the most suitable support area for each individual.
In addition, education and training play an important role in the effective use of print reductions. The health service providers, including nurses, supervisors and family members, should receive proper training to use and maintain these support areas.Hygiene and the detection of early signs of pressure ulcers are trained.
In summary, pressure reduction surfaces are valuable instruments for preventing and treatment of pressure ulcers in adults in community environments. Foam mattresses, air -fluidized beds and changing pressure mattresses offer different pressure redistribution and can be tailored to individual needs. The efficient use of these support interfaces is based on comprehensive training and continuous monitoringAs a result, the implementation of these strategies can effectively prevent and treat the Community Healthcare provider and improve the quality of life of adults in community environments.
