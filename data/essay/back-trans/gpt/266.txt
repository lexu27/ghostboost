Introduction (100 words)
The nutritional conservation techniques have developed throughout the history of mankind, which is due to the need to extend the durability of perishable goods. Effective conservation methods inhibit the microbial growth that prevents the durability and maintains the nutritional value of food.To examine various methods for the preservation of food and to discuss their classification based on microbiological mechanisms.
1. Heat cover methods (250 words)
A.Pasteurization: This method includes the use of a mild heat to destroy pathogenic and perishable microorganisms. Techniques such as long-term long-term long-term (LTLT) and high-temperature short-term pasteurization (HST) ensure the safety and preservation of foods such as dairy products,Juices and some canned goods.
B. Provisions: The use of high heat during the canned process is eliminated by microorganisms and enzymes, which prevents spoilage. This method makes food products commercially sterile and enables long -term preservation without cooling.
2. Cool storage methods (250 words)
A. Cooling: The maintenance of low temperatures (about 4 ° C) slows down the microbial growth significantly. This method inhibits perishable bacteria, shapes and yeasts and extends the warehouse duration of perishable products such as vegetables, meat and dairy products.
B. freezing: Freezing food at temperatures below -18 ° C keeps the biochemical reactions and microbial growth by receiving food in a state of suspended animation. This method preserves the quality, taste and nutritional content for a longer period of time.
3. Drying methods (250 words)
A. Sonnen drying: The oldest method for preserving food, sun drying, is based on natural heat and wind to remove moisture from food. The reduction of the moisture content is limited.
B.Dehydration: Modern dehydration methods use artificial heat sources such as ovens or dehydrators to maintain even and controlled drying conditions. Small moisture content hinders the microbial growth and enables long -term preservation of various foods such as back -like, dried spices and immediate soups.
4. Fermentation and pickling (200 words)
A.Fermentation: This preservation method includes the conversion of sugar and carbohydrates into alcohol, organic acids and gases by microorganisms, mainly bacteria and yeast. The fermented products include kimchi, sauerkraut, yogurt and cheese.Fermentation have been created, hinder the growth of perishable bacteria.
B. Pickling: Through divers of food in acidic solutions (vinegar, brine or lemon juice), the growth of corruption microbes is hindered. Traditional pickled products such as cucumbers, olives and inserted hering are maintained by the acidic nature of the preserving medium.
Conclusion (100 words)
Food preservation techniques that are classified based on microbiological mechanisms include a wide range of methods. microbial spoilage tooPreventing fermentation and choice use advantageous microorganisms and acidic environments to extend the durability. By understanding these conservation techniques, individuals can optimize food practices in order to minimize food waste, to ensure food safety and to expand the availability of nutritious foods.
