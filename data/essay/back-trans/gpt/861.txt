From an economic point of view, the cultural protectionism of Canada can hinder growth and competitiveness in global markets. The implementation of restrictive guidelines such as odds or tariffs for foreign cultural products could restrict the selection of consumers and hinder the flow of international creativity and innovation.Foreign investments in the Canadian cultural sector also discourage, which leads to a loss of employment opportunities and reduced income.
In addition, cultural protectionism could have unintentional negative consequences for the Canadian cultural industry. The shielding of local creators before the global competition is the risk of complacency and a reduced incentive for domestic artists to innovate and improve their craft. The introduction of globalization would be onePromote healthy competition and possibly make Canadian artists and creators to exceed on the international stage.
Politically, cultural protectionism can create gaps and prevent Canada's efforts to promote inclusiveness and diversity. Kanada is known for its multiculturalism and the acceptance of different cultures, and these values ​​can be effectively shown by the open exchange of ideas and cultures. The promotion of theDiversity through cultural exchange can continue to build harmonious relationships with other countries and contribute to its diplomatic efforts and its global reputation.
While it is crucial to maintain the cultural heritage, protectionism should not be the only approach.How cultural festivals, museums and educational programs would enable Canadians to appreciate and celebrate their culture and at the same time use the diversity.
In summary, I do not agree to Jeff Klassen's argument for cultural protectionism in Canada.Combined diversity and inclusiveness, is a more beneficial strategy for the cultural development of Canada.
