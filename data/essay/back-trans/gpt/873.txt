The XVII century was a significant time in history, when neo-confu-ideologies strongly influenced the regime of China, Japan and the Ottoman Empire.From women. By investigating laws, restrictions and social expectations that are present in these neo-concentration-by-the-art regimes, we can compare and contrast the experiences of women in these three regions.
In China, the Neo-Confucian regime put women in a subordinate position in the company. The family law of 1636 increased the patriarchal structure and emphasized the obedience of women towards men and the primacy of male descent. The state checked the marriage and established legal codes,which restricted the rights and freedoms of women. For example, the foot bond, a practice from the 10th century, gained in popularity at this time.Practice increased the ideal of women as submissive and physically dependent on men, which effectively restricted their mobility.
Similarly, women in Japan were exposed to social expectations and restrictions in Japan during the 20th century, which reinforced the subordinate roles. The Tokugawa Shogunate has implemented guidelines that aimed at controlling society, including strict regulations for marriage and inheritance.considered to the family's honor and had to maintain strict behavioral skills that are known as the "good woman, wise mother" ideology.Values ​​are rooted, limited women to domestic areas and limited their access to education and public life.
In contrast to the experiences of women in China and Japan, the position of women in the Ottoman Empire during the 20th century is interesting differences.Opportunities Bot.ISLAMIC THEEN recognized the importance of women in society and emphasized their rights and roles within the community.was encouraged, and some women with elite backgrounds even actively contributed to the art and scholarships.was absent.
If one goes beyond laws and restrictions, it is important to understand the effects of social expectations on the life of women in the century of the XVII.Confucianism influenced the perception of women as intellectually inferior and focused on their domestic tasks. This gender standards were reinforced by education and popular culture. For exampleTheir sophisticated female nature was viewed.
In summary, the position of women in neocon -fucian regimes during the 20th century in China and Japan was remarkably similar, with both societies imposed on strict laws, restrictions and social expectations that were subordinate to women. This restrictions limited their mobility, refused access to educationand limited them to domestic roles. The Ottoman Empire, although it was influenced by Islamic teachings with a relatively comprehensive perception of women, still imposed restrictions that have a feeling of hierarchy. The experiences of women in these three regions underline the significant effectsFrom neokon fucian ideologies on gender roles and show the need for a critical assessment of social expectations to promote gender equality.
