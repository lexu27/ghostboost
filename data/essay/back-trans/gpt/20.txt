An outstanding risk in connection with the continuation of the project is the lack of financial resources. The development of a web -based system includes a significant investment in relation to workers and technology.This would include the assessment of expenses for infrastructure, web development, data migration and ongoing maintenance. The search for external means or partnerships could also help to reduce financial restrictions.
Another risk is the potential for the scope of the scope to which the project requirements go beyond the original scope and lead to delays and increased costs. This can be reduced by ensuring that everyone involved is involved in the definition of the project scope in advanceand set up a change control process to manage all changes. Regulatory communication and cooperation between the development team, the project manager and the university employee can help prevent crawling and ensure project continuity.
The performance risks include problems such as data security violations and system reliability. The sensitive nature of the student information and transcripts requires strict safety measures. The development team should prioritize data encryption techniques, access control mechanisms and regular security audits in order to alleviate the risk of non -authorized access or data leakage.and monitoring are ensured, including stress tests, load tests and regular backups.
In order to identify and mitigate these risks, a structured approach should be applied. This includes the implementation of a comprehensive risk assessment in the initiation phase of the project.to uncover potential threats and weaknesses. This risks should then be classified due to their probability and effects, which enables the prioritization of the reduction efforts.
In order to effectively reduce the identified risks, risk management plans should be created and checked regularly.become.
The creation of a web -based system for storing information and transcripts from the university is combined, the risks related to the project duration, completion and performance of the end product form.Ongoing risk assessment and management contribute to the success of the project and the provision of a powerful system.
