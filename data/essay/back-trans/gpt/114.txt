Breast cancer is a serious health problem that affects numerous people all over the world, especially women. It is important to identify and understand the critical factors that contribute to its development in order to develop appropriate prevention and treatment strategies.that influence the development of breast cancer are inheritance, diseases of the mammary glands and hormonal factors.
Inheritance plays an important role in the susceptibility of breast cancer. Inheritance gene mutations such as BRCA1 and BRCA2 increase the risk of developing breast cancer. Personal with a strong family history of the disease, these mutated genes are more likely to be noted that hereditary factors are importantJust make up a small percentage of breast cancer cases, the majority being sporadic.

An early detection of metastasis is an effectiveTreatment planning of essential importance, while the aggressiveness of breast cancer aids is determined when choosing suitable treatment strategies. Health awareness campaigns, genetic tests and regular screening are of essential importance for combating breast cancer and the reduction in the effects on individuals and communities.
