Amazon is an e-commerce giant that revolutionized the way in which people have revolutionized. However, the success has a prize: the treatment of his employees. Problems such as dissatisfaction with jobs and high sales rates have largely been reported, which concerns about the concerns about the concernsThe company causes work practices to analyze these problems and suggest a potential solution by examining the use of conservative motivational framework and strategies.
The dissatisfaction with workplaces is a significant problem with Amazon. Reports on long working hours, unrealistic performance goals and a lack of work-life balance were common. A study by Blyton and Jenkins (2017) for job satisfaction showed that these factors have a reduced job satisfactionand an increased sales intentions of the employees. The Amazon focus on efficiency and productivity may have contributed to a work environment in which the speed about the well -being of employees is estimated, which leads to dissatisfaction.
High fluctuation rates are another important problem with Amazon. The demanding nature of the job and the lack of recognition of employees contribute to a higher sales.that dissatisfied employees are more likely to leave their work.
In order to address these problems, a potential solution is to use more conservative motivational framework and strategies. A such framework is the two-factor theory of Frederick Herzberg. This theory suggests that the presence of certain factors, which are referred to as hygiene factors, the dissatisfactioncan prevent workplaces but not be able to motivate the employees. This factors include working conditions, job security and interpersonal relationships. The improvement of working conditions, the guarantee of job security and the promotion of positive relationships could reduce the dissatisfaction of jobs among his employees.
Another strategy that could be used is the use of the theory of social exchange. This theory assumes that the employees are motivated if they perceive fairness in their exchange relationship to the organization. The implementation of guidelines that prioritize fairness,such asB. Transparent performance ratings and fair remuneration practices, Amazon can increase the motivation of the employees and reduce sales rates.
However, it is important to take into account the challenges in the implementation of these conservative motivational framework and strategies. AMAZON works to a large extent and makes it difficult to ensure these strategies in all warehouses and departments uniformly.To prioritize well -being of the employees from productivity because the company's success is strongly associated with its efficiency.
In summary, it can be said that the treatment of its employees is significant challenges by Amazon, characterized by the dissatisfaction of the jobs and the high sales rates.The company tackles these topics. However, the scale of the company and the potential resistance to management can result in the implementation challenges. However, the well -being and the motivation of employees is of crucial importance for the long -term organizational success and should be a focus on Amazon.
