The thinking about a time when I was discriminated against, which was based on my ethnicity, has undoubtedly shaped my perspective on discussions about race and cultural identity. As a minority in a predominantly homogeneous community, I was often experienced prejudices and stereotypes that were deeply hurtfuland were discouraging. This experiences have taught me how important it is to perform open and respectful discussions about breed and cultural identity.
When I approached conversations with people who have negative views, I try to promote understanding and empathy, at react with anger or defense, I try to listen carefully and to recognize your concerns.I found that I disarmed the hostility and create a basis for a real dialogue.
There were cases in which I could change the attitude of someone through the dialogue or create understanding. I remember lively of an employee who made racist comments on my cultural traditions.The meaning of these traditions and emphasized their beauty and symbolism.
These experiences have increased my belief in the power of dialogue to combat prejudices and ignorance. I understood that the promotion of empathy and the promotion of openness is often more effective than the confrontation of negativity with hostility.We challenge stereotypes, dispel misunderstandings and promote more integrative society. After I have undergone discrimination, I recognize how important it is to bring people together through the dialogue in order to create an environment of understanding, acceptance and appreciation for all cultures.
