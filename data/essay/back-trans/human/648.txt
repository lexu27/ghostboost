Kaplan analyzes the representation of women in a film with Laura Mulveys The Male Gaze Theory and Psychoanalysis. Kaplan argues that historically women in the melodrama genre were only the focus of attention, and while melodrama puts the limits that the family puts on women,Evests, also forces women to accept these limits as inevitable and normal. Caplan argues that culture is deeply rooted in male and female dominance patterns.and women objectified. In the male look, a woman is visually positioned as an object of heterosexual male desire. Feelings, thoughts and sexual desires are less important than her foreign of the male desire.
The postman always rings twice (1946) is a famous example of the male look. The viewer is introduced to the main character of the film Cora Smith and focuses on her sexuality. In the deed, the viewer knows that Cora is sexy before youName knows. With close -ups, the camera forces the viewer to look at Cora's body.Women as desirable sex objects.
Filmmakers often try to avoid female characters as sex objects by giving them complex background stories, strong motivations and an active role in the action of their history.Personal motivations, but she is still clearly there to look at her.
