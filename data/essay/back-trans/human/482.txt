Since it is assumed that skiing is a rather traumatic sport, the company would have had to take precautionary measures to minimize the risks of injury for skiers. In this case, howeverThe fact that it was April and the slopes should be closed could reduce the degree of responsibility of the company in this special case, but not complete. The company made a mistake that made people ski after the snow storm,Although it did not allow people to do this, and then the company's actions have not only endangered the skiers but also the employees.
Although Mr. Craig was injured by Mr. Alex, it is not only his responsibility in his cause. It would not have happened if Dan and Abby could not have prevented him without an instructor who could have prevented Mr. Alex 'injuryWould have sent a slope. The health damage was caused by both the company and by Mr. Craig, but does not mean that the compensation for the violation of Mr. Alex is part of Mr. Craig's responsibility, since his actions are the result of the actions ofDan and Abby are. So the company should compensate for Mr. Alex's treatment costs, which rely on the severity of the damage and the length of the recovery phase (Goguen, N.d.). Apart from that, the company should pay for the ski devices that were spoiled during the accident.
The fact that skiing is a traumatic sport means that Mr. Alex himself should have known the health risks with which he was faced with skiing after the end of the season.Driving that relies on his experiences says that he understood all possible risks, but it confirms that he tried to escape the crash and act professionally without violations of the skiing rules and norms.Craig, who caused the collision, is the responsibility and responsibility of those who have sent a poorly qualified skier to the uncomfortable slope.
