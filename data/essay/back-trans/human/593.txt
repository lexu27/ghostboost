The pursuit of student transcripts can be a severe bureaucratic job that has to be eliminated as technological progress. These technologies include database management systems with which an orderly library of student transcripts as well as the students themselves, faculties, departments and other essential units within theUniversity can be created. The unique list of students can help avoid confusion if the same first or the last name implemented the same or according to names and transitions to other courses are implemented, which means that the student's main key is not lessis important, the ability to search and maintain statistics for certain keys for courses, faculties, groups and students individually, just like their work.Submit applications to the archive for a physical search.
It is worth noting that the security problems of this project consist of a possible data leak. This database should only contain the data that is already open to the public: no more than the name and last name of each student.Use data loss. This database can be a practical tool for saving all student information, but this should not be done for security reasons. This project is mainly aimed at a more convenient bookkeeping in student work, which is also protected by copyright and is not available within the projectThe papers themselves should be saved in other safe places in the university by the identification numbers used in the database in order to achieve an easy and quick access.Provide the problem.
