Faster of relativism believe that morality does not exist in the objective sense. The moral norms assumed in society are not mandatory for compliance and execution. In absolute terms, the concepts of evil and good are nothing more than fiction.Researchers Porus that moral relativism could easily degenerate into the admissibility (Bush and Moss, 2020). This way, people who adhere to this view can be perceived as those who try to devalue moral norms to the lowest possible levelTry to catch up with compromises and negotiate with mutual advantageous terms.
On the contrary, the objectivism indicates that there are correct and wrong that do not depend on the opinions or other factors of a person.Variations and interpretations of objectivism, but the key idea is to announce a real truth. This obviously contradicts the concept of relativism in every respect (Bush and Moss, 2020).But in their core, all rules and standards develop for an unchangeable understanding of bad and good.
I find relativism despite a few mistakes that it contains.can be referred to or not. In principle, most people always try to act ethically, but even then their actions can be perceived negatively.Prism of experience, carry out the psychological characteristics of a person, the circumstances and weighing up of many factors. I find objectivism too utopian as an ultimatum that tries to simplify morality and at the same time threaten with a distorted view of reality.
