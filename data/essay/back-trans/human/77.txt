When I learned something about religions and philosophies, I think that origins or backgrounds for the interpretation of the context and the content of a religion are essential. For jainism, it was important to learn that it is much older than a better -known and contemporary sikhism.Although both close relationships with Hinduism have, the origins of Sihkism come to only about 500 years ago, while Jaainism has a story of almost 2500 years (Molloy 191). The Sikhism shows a more militaristic approach for monotheism, although it is more modern.As such, the jainist of conviction that there is no creator and that the universe is simply guided by natural forces, is particularly interesting because it rejects a very traditional integration of deities into theology.
Afterwards it is also interesting for me to observe to what extent a religion interacts through its perspective with the world. As mentioned above, Jainism rejects belief in a creator or God.To be made. There are contradictions in typical monotheistic religions such as God, which are both perfect, as well as an imperfect world or God who loves all life but still allows suffering.God does not have to be created if everything had to be created in the universe? This worldview is surprisingly modern and potentially controversial for your time.
Ethics is another important part of every philosophy or a belief system. Jainism establishes five different principles of ethics, the Ahimsa (non-violence), Satya (truth), astheya (non-monitoring), Brahmacharya (chastity) and Aparigraha (non-ownership).I am particularly interested in Ahimsa, who is the core of Jainist ethics. This is because I believe that many religions excuse violence due to their beliefs, which is naturally immoral for my values.is therefore unused.
