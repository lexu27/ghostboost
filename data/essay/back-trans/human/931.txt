The crime data explorer on the UCR website showed that 398.5 violent crimes per 100,000 people were committed in 2020. This shows a significant increase compared to a much lower 380.8 average in 2019.2020 with 400.1 violent crimes per 100,000 people. This is a more drastic increase, since 2019 showed that the average crime rate in the state was 326.2..It is still an increase compared to an average of 237.5 in the previous year. In this sense you can say that the average crime rates have increased in several places, if not nationwide.

The UCR database was able to provide a precise view of the greater image of crime in the United States. However, it was less effective to present the trends and changes in crime.Last years provide detailed information on the details of crimes. The database was less effective when providing connections and comparisons between populations and conditions. This data is important in order to capture the implication of crime on victimology in the United States.Can be measured by a number of concepts such as hospital stays, crime reports, incidence rate and other factors. Statistics in terms of crime rates are important to determine the causes of victimization and the way the crime rates affect the victimdo not agree to the post because the current figures indicate an increase in the crime rates.However, this can be attributed to improved reporting and not an increase in the crimes actually committed.
