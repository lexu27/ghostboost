I would like to thank my descendants that my work is not forgotten. This history of eternal love is probably relevant in their days, so there are many filman adaptations and versions of "Romeo and Julia". The new adaptation of my piece generally has a controversial impressionMade: The actors look suitable for their roles, but the internal topic of the piece does not seem to be so profound.
Carlo Carleas "Romeo and Julia" (2013) was shot on medieval sites and villas in various Italian cities with at least historical inaccuracies. The game of some characters is good: Hayley Steinfeld reminds us that Julia was a child for modern standardsA woman. Any of the scenes have been revised to better understand the history of the younger public. The details have been changed and the lines were shortened to maintain the desperate emotional level that the modern audience begins.that the prologue has been changed. Romeo does not radiate a ounce of passion or romance, although it is more male in terms of nature, voice and fighting than in previous incarnations. I wonder whether the director and the producers understand the timeless theme of the playhave.
They made a film that, I think, contains the greatest weaknesses and strengths of mankind in relation to love and lust, but the characters behave radically differently, whereby the dialogue is thoughly thrown in and ignored or stepped with feetIt is no longer an adaptation and instead becomes a parody. The adaptation seems to exist in the original game.
