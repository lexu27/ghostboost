Theodor Adorno's concept of industrial culture implied a strong connection between capitalist society and product capitalism in the cultural area to improve the existing social practices that benefit capitalism., Television programs reinforce the faith of the population in capitalist values.Prioritizing society equally can become clearer their differences through application to modern culture and society.
In his theory, Adorno pointed to the obvious narrative of mass media products such as films and books, in which prosperity is often associated with luck. However, a more obvious connection to the strengthening of capitalism is entertainment for children.Form of television programs, cartoons and animation films are exposed to different media. In Structural functionalism -the entertainment industry for children presents a source of education and emotional development.The basis for security in the future society is used. In the approach of industrial culture, however, the entertainment of modern children focuses on the sale of the goods of various characters in films. For exampleTo win children for their theme parks (Clement, 2018). Now the company plans strategically simultaneous introduction of animated films and goods with the figures of the films to ensure the financial benefits.
