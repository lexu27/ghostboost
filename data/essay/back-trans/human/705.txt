The social determinants of health are the conditions in the area in which people live, learn, work, play, worship and age, I agree that the social environment in which people live can influence their health.Not only determined by biological factors or access to high -quality health care (centers for the control and prevention of diseases). Resources that improve the quality of life can significantly influence the health of a population.
Examples of these resources are safe and affordable living space, access to education, public security, availability of healthy food, local emergency services and an environment that free from life -threatening toxins (Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, N.D.)In the opinion that it is exclusively the individual to influence your health in order to recognize the significant effects of external influences on it.
