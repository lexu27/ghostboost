Genetically modified organisms (GVOS) have become part of the life of all people, but they remain a controversial topic so far.However, that GVO is only a further progress in the life of people than the creation of machines, cars or spaceships.I am not concerned about long -term effects like some of my colleagues because I find GMO as a product of selection that has been there for centuries.to breed that have certain properties as possible.
I would use the principles of utilitarianism to support my claim. This theory is based on the view that everything is ethical if it contributes as much as possible for as many people. GVO can help people overcome one of the main problems,The famine are. GVO are resistant to hard environmental conditions, so that people can grow more plants and other important plants. Millions of people are still starving and need food, so that the production of more food is advantageous for everyone. Of course, use the deontological approachAnd indicate that it is simply wrong to disturb the genetic codes because it is the divine domain. GVO are considered attempts by people to play God, which is morally wrong, but I would emphasize that people tooThe planet was given to take care of it.The use of innovative tools is therefore another way to follow the Christian postulates and take care of all creatures.
