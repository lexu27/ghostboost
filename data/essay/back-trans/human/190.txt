In the narrower sense, the "zero-sum history" of the conviction that there is a competition between racial groups, and every progress for a group is a threat to resources and the position of another (McGhee). This history is the mainstream-Paradigm for conservative media and has been told for years in various forms.McGhee's outstanding examples are the history of public swimming pools in cities in the USA. At the beginning of the 20th century there were massive public swimming pools in many US cities, but at that time "only" only "only white" pool. After numerousDrowning incidents were instructed by the local communities to open the pools for all people regardless of their breed that provoked a counter -reaction of the white residents. Infiten, cities preferred to close or privatize public insteads instead of allowing people of different breeds,To use them freely. This is an example of the destruction of public goods and a massive increase in costs for the entire population due to the way of thinking.
Another negative example of McGhee is a political nature.Many whites have stopped pushing the social government's policy in relation to jobs and social benefits after the black community joined the agenda. In the end, this means less social justice and social advantages for the whole country, since the supporters of the paradigm "Vigorous â€œdo not want other breeds to benefit from these guidelines. The arguments presented by McGhee seem to be sensible and fair for me - they describe the past and current things in the United States well. The main reason is why I think isThe factual and statistical support of your position - it is very difficult to argue that the United States has considerable social and economic problems due to racism.
