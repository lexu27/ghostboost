Elephants dance the polonaise, lions juggling balls, bears drive bicycles, a tiger jumps through a burning tire all. These are attractions with four-legged actors who inspire the audience, especially the little ones.Creatures are unnatural. They are considered mockery and torture.
Since the 1970s, numerous nations have established laws on the treatment of creatures and guarantee their essential protection. International agreements have been concluded and realized that animals are sensitive beings whose basic needs have to be respected and protected (Marino 148).The animals have taught the entertainment of the public, not familiar with their natural behavior. The only way to follow them is to punish them and rob them of food so that the poor hungry creature will do everything for a coveted bite(Arnold-Foster 146). Animals must maintain and express the specific behavior for their species, and the concept of the circuses contradicts this shepherd.
In addition, the expression of "animal actors" often reminds positive emotions, since action is always associated with romance. In contrast to their human colleagues, animals never voluntarily choose the profession of actor. Circus experience means losing freedom forever and 95% ofTo spend time alone in a cramped cage in which animals are not at full height and can turn around (station 131). They suffer extensively, but there is nothing that they can change because people apply more thoughtful and bedfall violence.
The conclusion can be drawn that the introduction of restrictions on the use of animals in the circus in the current world is a necessary measure. Creatures must be allowed to follow their instincts and be in their natural habitat, as this is their basic freedom. All people have to understand that the rights of animals have to be protected, and therefore one has to refuse to visit performances that have been created by violence and cruelty.
