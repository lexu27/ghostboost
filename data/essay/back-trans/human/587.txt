Roger L. Martin, a respected scholar and author, described his understanding of a good strategy. He explained that it should not be formed by long and careful research, but should appear in a natural way through the "rough and prepare" process, since the process should appearStrategy only exists outside the comfort zone in this way.Is not a natural human feature, but a person who can learn a person. In the beginning of their career, you have to inevitably pursue a thorough approach for your decisions so that you can later expand your talent and act quickly.
Another important thing that you should remember is that strategic planning is not the same as for business planning.What the company offers, how it does and who the customer is, the strategy plan the measures that are necessary to achieve these goals. With other words, business planning includes the presentation and definition of goals while the strategic planning implies,that these goals are carried out and this are built into the desirable timeline.
In summary, a strategic plan is a well -designed sentence of priorities and instructions that are necessary to achieve the goals of the company.Planning is closely linked to business planning, since these two build, structure and carry out everything that is given in the global business idea.
