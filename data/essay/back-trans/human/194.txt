Diabetes of type 1 usually develops due to the autoimmune destruction of pancreas beta cells in genetically predisposed individuals. The damage to beta cells occurs for months or years in the form of insulitis on a subclinical level.Do not process fat tissue. This stimulates the secretion of antagonistic hormones such as glucagon, adrenaline, cortisol and growth hormone (Lee et al., 2019). This antagonistic hormones, especially glucagon, promote gluconeogenesis, glycogenolysis and ketogenesis in the liverHyperglycaemia and an anionic metabolic azidoselon. Type -2 -2 -ti -Diabetes is the most frequently occurring pathology of the endocrine system organs. The core mechanism of disease development is insulin resistance (Lee et al., 2019).Or several effects of insulin in its average concentration in the blood. The insulin resistance creates the inability of insulin-dependent tissue to absorb blood plasma glucose and disrupt glycogen synthesis in the liver.
People with diabetes should eat according to a structured regime and get their medication with meals. For type -1 diabetes, a recommended diet includes carbohydrates made of fruit, vegetables, whole grains, legumes and lean milk. Patients with type -2 -diabetes, complex carbohydrates such as brownRice, whole grain wheat, fruit, vegetables and beans should be included in the rations (Sinclair et al., 2019). At the same time, it should be avoided for both types of diseases, the consumption of simple carbohydrates such as sugar, noodles, white bread, flour, cookies,Proxipation. During the first type of diabetes, together with the diet Insulin Degludec (Tresiba) is required. It is suitable to confuse hypoglycemia in patients over 18 years.al., 2019).
