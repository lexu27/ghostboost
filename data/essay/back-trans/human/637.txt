The end and the beginning and Hitler's first photo of Wis≈Çawa Szymborska are two poems that share thematic elements that deal with time, war and the invisibility of evil.Work suggests that both work in mass murderers.
The end and the beginning of Szymborska tells the reconstruction of affected areas after a war.With "someone has to tidy up after every war" (Szymborska, lines 1-2), which is the focus of the poem. There are wars within a universal timeline, such as outlined by Szymborska.The press and the media are interested in the end, and at the beginning of the reconstruction, the nation is populated with people who knew little or nothing of the war (Szymborska, lines 1-4)., which they did not live (lines 39-42). Birth and innocence become a widespread topic at the end of the poem and will be particularly important for understanding the thematic analysis of both works by the author.
The second poem, also from Szymborska, Hitler's first photo, offers various pictures of Hitler as newborn and stands strongly of allusion to his future as a dictator and contribution to a genocide.Doctor, a priest or worked in the opera house in Vienna (Szymborska, lines 3-7). Only his presence as a child is known in the poem that creates an illusion of the past. Hitler is a newborn as a young boy with teensy hands,a small angel and a happy assets.Supported by pictures of him who are prone to regular childish behaviors of the wine with other children in family albums alike and susceptible to regular childish behavior if he waits too long that the photographer takes a photo.
