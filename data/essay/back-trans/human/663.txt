Overpopulation is a relevant factor when you consider that it has led to disadvantageous environmental and social effects.2019). So there is urgently necessary to control the overpopulation when you consider that this will lead to the preservation of the planet (Weber & Sciubba, 2019).Extraction of resources from the environment such as overfishing, contamination of water and the soil deterioration has controlled, which leads to exhaustion.
Water has become a tight goods due to activities such as the overflowing of groundwater. Humans consume large amounts of water when their population increases, which leads to their exhaustion. Deadly other activities such as water pollution through industrial waste and marine dumping have reduced the water level (Weber& Sciubba, 2019). Another situation caused by the growing population is the exhaustion of natural resources such as fish due to the increasing demand for these aquatic animals (Weber & Sciubba, 2019).what leads to extinction.
The deterioration in the ground is another regressive indicator that means the change in the ecosystem. The activities that promote soil erosion include the overcultivation of land for commercial agriculture in order to maintain the growing population, and overwhelming animals (Weber & Sciubba,2019). This activities lead to reducing the soil quality that has promoted the loss of biological diversity.Stopping threats when you consider that human activities destroy the ecosystem. The reduction of the population can be promoted by working for family planning programs and using new nature conservation alternatives like not in the oceans.
