The researchers have recently developed the self -driving technologies significantly. Many companies consider self -driving vehicles as the future of growth in supply chain management. In general, self -operative technologies can minimize expenses for the delivery of the goods.Implementation of such technologies is changed the entire transport system. The positive aspects of these innovations have special ethical considerations.
Self -driving technologies can significantly improve the development of the transport industry. The global delivery of supply data can be developed efficiently into artificial intelligence -based vehicles. In the following, the truck industry and supply management will be more efficient and practical.Reduced. It is achieved by eliminating the driver's profession, since self -driven technologies require almost no human work. A further positive influence of self -driven technologies is better customer service and a quick delivery.also contributes to more waste reliability in deliveries. A researcher believes that the automation of supply chain management will contribute to the deeper partnership between companies (Kota, 2018).
The most dangerous adverse effect of self -driving technologies is the global job loss. This is an important ethical and socially important topic that should be addressed before the implementation of technologies.Transport industry to ensure the efficient delivery of products. However, if self -driven technologies are involved, all of these people lose their work. It is important to develop special training programs for drivers to change their specialty.
