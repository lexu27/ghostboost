The main topic of the discussion is the abolition of vaccines and weekly investigations by the Supreme Court against the Coronavirus mandate for companies. After the mandate, Osha would become the supervisory authority for compliance with the rule in a company with more than 100 employees. In contrast to the acute corona virus-Situation recognized the Supreme Court that the Osha exceeded its authority because the right to comply with such a mandate should remain with the employer.
One of the perspectives is that the Covid situation deteriorates and the mandate was a logical continuation of bidens guideline to combat coronavirus. Laut CNBC analysis of the Johns Hopkins University data was registered in seven days more than 731,000 new daily infections.During the discussion, however, the point of view was expressed that the decision to comply with the mandate should not be binding, but remains with the employer.
The main argument is that such measures are too radical and that the image of the illness is not fully considered. The Supreme Court also agrees to this opinion, which came to the conclusion that ETS went beyond the regulation of security at the workplace and into the area ofGeneral measures of public health (Bickel et al., 2022). The court also explained that a Coronavirus infection was included in universal risk diseases and could be compared with the risk of everyday dangers, which could not be done with the workplace of the employeehas (Bickel et al., 2022). The last argument against the introduction of the mandate could be that Osha did not have enough historical practice to carry out such a broad experiment. This leads to the logical conclusion that the decision of the court andThe perspective expressed in the discussion are completely justified and have a lot of negative sides than at first glance.
