One possibility of how sociology can make a valuable contribution to understanding the interrelation between breed and health differences is to shape a working definition of the breed that emphasizes its relevant aspects.Has gained traction, the concept of the breed is often influenced by the ideas of physical anthropology and genetic inheritance. A reasonable sociological approach to the topic of race in connection with health differences can be reduced by concentrating on the shift principles of the breed, such as z.B. socio -economic disadvantages and discrimination (Hummer, 1996). This approach enables the socio -economic factors to concentrate that are most relevant as social determinants of health and thus enable a better understanding of causal relationships.
Another and more specific way, as sociology explains the connection between breed and health differences, is to concentrate on the environmental context of health.Healthier lifestyle and especially for nutrition explained. KWATE (2008) offers an example of what can be done in this regard in the investigation of the interrelation of the interrelationship between residence strict and fast food.Physical and social characteristics of a neighborhood to determine why Fast -Food outlets in separate black quarters are built proportional (Kwate, 2008). In this way, Kwate (2008) shifts the attention of the simple explanations and assumptions that the discussionThe problem can control the problem in the wrong direction - like the assumption that blacks like more. The sociological approach, as in the above case, enables the actual structural factors for the interrelation between breed and health differences.
