There are many different types of sea microbes that exist in massive quantities in the water. Under the oxidizing nitrite bacteria there are six main types: nitrotoga, nitrolancetus, nitrospina, nitrobacter and nitrococcus (HAN 2). One of the fascinating bacterial speciesNitrobacter, which plays a crucial role in the nutrition of plants. This is a nitrifying bacterium, it serves as a simple way to release nitrogen that comes from plants. This paper aims to analyze the essence of the nitrobacter, its specificFeatures of his position in the ecosystem.
Nitrobacter is the most interesting among the other types, since it is involved in the conversion of nitrite into nitrates. The nitrification takes place due to the receipt of nitrates from ammonia through oxidation, and the process is done with the help of the bacterial couple, which are nitrobacter and nitrosomona(Han 3) It will soon be important to mention the concept of nitrification and the operations it contains in the order. Since the process takes place in the ground, it is a remarkable biological phenomenon, which also connects the other factors associated with naturecan influence. The nitrogen cycle is an essential part of the biological processes, and bacteria that exist in the soil participate in the majority of the chemical phases that produce atmospheric nitrogen in the new condition.
Overall, nitrobacter is an essential part of maintaining the variety of microorganism in the soil, which is provided by its oxidation activity.. From these reasons, nitrobacter is an exceptionally fascinating way of nitrite -oxidizing bacteria.
