Confidence intervals are statistical instruments that help measure the uncertainty of a sustained variable. Based on technical restrictions and lack of resources, researchers cannot use the general population so that they have to limit themselves to small representative samples.The population is risky, so that confidence intervals can reduce this uncertainty (el-masri, 2012). In the clinical sciences, the use of confidence intervals proves to be crucial, since it minimizes the threat to public health by specifying quantitiesMedicines in market quantities, for example, are of crucial importance to use the exact value of the active ingredient, and the use of a 99% confidence interval creates a need for almost analytical accuracy to calculate the mass of this substance. A further example is the comparison of the resultsSeveral groups of several patient resistance to develop preventive measures for reliable results (El-Masri, 2012). In fact, there are more opportunities to use confidence intervals of different accuracy in healthcare. For the number of population, including COVID-19, it is important to consistentto be and the most reliable statistical measurements. A confidence interval enables us to cover the weakness in the form of uncertainties due to natural variation and dynamics. So confidence intervals are used in medical sciences to improve accuracy and to minimize errors of whichHuman life and health can be the same.
A convenience sample method was used to record the ten growth data that was to question the respondents that are most convenient to the experiment initiator., and therefore increased the likelihood of systematic mistakes and distortions.Increasing representativity: This is a layered sample method, but it is not certain where and how the data was collected by the professor.
* For a sample of twenty respondents, the average was 70.4.
* With MS Excel, a 95% confidence interval was calculated for the previously calculated mean. This was as follows: 95% [66.6, 74.2].
* The 95% confidence interval was that the true medium height for the general population was between 66.6 and 74.2 inches.
It is easy to see that with increasing accuracy of the confidence interval (up to 99%), the margins are more extensive, since the likelihood that the actual population value is confident will be increased. With other words, for a 95% confidence interval there is a probabilityof 5% to lie wrong, but for an interval of 99%, this probability is reduced to 1%. Following the final interval must be wider in order to cover more values.distinguishes real value. If the confidence interval is increased to 99% (widening of the area), this is more likely to be higher, since the spread is increased relatively to the true mean.to increase the confidence interval.This is the necessary price to pay more securely: the higher the desired accuracy to localize the actual value, the higher the likelihood.
