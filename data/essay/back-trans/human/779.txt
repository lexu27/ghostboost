I have a photo in front of me that represents a lot of people, but the focus is only on a person in the middle. He is surrounded by people who can be mentally divided into civil servants (the presence of business suits differentiates them) andNormal citizens. On the faces of everyone who can be seen, you can see confusion, a feeling of injustice and lawlessness.
If I want to turn to a more detailed analysis of this photo, I would like to find that this work has put on me through the personality of the person. It is difficult not to recognize Nelson Mandela in this work. After you have read the description of the photoYou therefore can feel the circumstances under which this photo was published. If you look at the picture, you can feel the emotions of the central figure.Effect emphasized when the main character of the photo seems to be over all other participants (Macdonald, 1). Despite it is remarkable that Mandela confronts people in suits when ordinary people are behind him and are ready to support himAs if to reveal the topic of the confrontation between state and normal citizens, Nelson Mandela feels like a hero who is confident and his victory overwhelmes. The author of the photo shows that he is on the side of the accused and this with differentemphasizes visual effects.
This work comes into the soul well; I want to analyze and visualize the photo.Imagine what Mandela says at that moment and what people are screaming behind his back, a pleasant feeling. This work we call "touches in the depths of the soul", the photo reflects a pioneering historical event and conveys the right atmosphere, thanks to which we experience real feelings.
