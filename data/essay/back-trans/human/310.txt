The effects of a biblical stewardship perspective on the proposed financial plan
The biblical perspective on the administration assumes that leaders receive control over other people and resources from God (Carradus, Zozimo & Discua Cruz, 2020).To honor. In this regard, the current financial plan was developed in a way that benefits everyone involved, including healthcare service providers of critical patients and advisory employees.
The potential holes and unknowns in the financial plan of the project
Although the financial plan apparently deals most of the expenses that can occur during project realization, there are still some unknown people who should be taken into account.should be appropriate to react. In the event of the current project, it is initially difficult to predict the actual demand for psychiatric services in doctors.Crises and the resulting inflation rates lead to a price increase, which in turn would require additional money to buy devices and medication.
Assumptions that can fill the potential holes in the financial plan of the project
As far as the former hole of the financial plan is concerned, it can be assumed that the demand for psychological services for medical experts will provide average demand for mental services.It is explained by the fact that if the expected demand is low, the actual necessity is high, the patients are largely under -supplied, the opposite if the expectations are high, but the actual demand is low, this leads to significant financial losses.With regard to inflation, it is necessary to adopt a certain amount of money for unforeseen expenses. If the prices rise, the organization can therefore continue to pay the planned expenses.
