The testing is one of the criteria for the test quality. It shows how exactly the test guarantees the examined phenomenon measures. The reliability is normally determined after analyzing the test elements and the final test form is compiled. A special test validation is carried out to determine (Whiston, 2017). A test based on two types of information can be described as reliably. At most, a test is referred to as reliably if it is interference -resistant. If the test is carried out under different conditions, it provides similar results.Reliable if it is consistent internally (homogeneous). This means that there is no inconsistencies within the procedure itself, and the methodology for analyzing the results is selected correctly.
Like any human activity, tests contain errors. The following types of errors occur in the tests: failure, systematic and random errors.that the measured feature does not change in time and that all deviations are caused by measurement discretion. The limit between random and systematic errors is due.the quality of the test and the examination conditions.
The test results always contain mistakes, regardless of how carefully the test was administered. However, under the use of methods of mathematical statistics, it is possible to estimate the size of the entire test error and to evaluate the test.The testing is therefore a characteristic of the scale, in which differences between the test participants reflect the differences in the properties of the test participants and to what extent they reflect random errors.
