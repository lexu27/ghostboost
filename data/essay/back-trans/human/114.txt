One of the most critical factors for the development of breast cancer is inheritance because it causes a genetically inherent illness. If breast cancer has been diagnosed with the closest relatives of the patient, the likelihood of a tumor is also high at a young age (Coleman & Tsongalis, 2016).Since one of the close relatives of the patient had this disease, this diagnosis is also possible for them. A further significant factor in the development of cancer is different diseases of the mammaries, such as "cystic" breasts. In the presence of such conditions is the educationAtypical cells in the mammary gland possible (Tkaczuk et al., 2016). This can lead to its overgrown and increase the risk of serious diseases.
The hormonal factor also has a critical influence on health. In the case described, this aspect is the most important because it contains different details of the patient's life.. This means that the patient's hormonal background can be interrupted (Tkaczuk et al., 2016). So it becomes more difficult for the body to deal with abnormal processes.
If there is an initial stage of cancer, there may be no metastasis in the patient's organs. However, early active metastasis is characteristic of aggressive forms of cancer.Using case to avoid future health problems. The histological analysis of the tissue can determine the aggressiveness of the cancer type early.It is remembered that metastases in a latent state are able to exist in the long term in a latent state to even exist five to ten years after the primary tumor has been removed.
