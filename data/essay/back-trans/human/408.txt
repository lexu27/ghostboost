Marx 'thesis about the fetishism of raw materials focuses on the tendency of society to place the value on raw materials based on contributing workers, which inevitably causes the rule of products beyond humans.Customers and producers from: The estimated objects are exchanged independently for the respective purposes. Such an exchange of objects occurs regardless of human needs or decisions (Ritzer, 2011). In this case, it is important to note that the term fetishism does not have any sexualismConnotation provides. It only explains the inclination of the people to devote themselves to the principles mentioned.
In modern society we have technological trends in the same way as Marx 'thesis. For example, even though it is sometimes considered unethical, the overall picture of the brand benefits. The overall picture and hundreds of workers are making the manufacture of the articles, their values ​​rise regardless of their quality.Public and marketing strategies as from their original value.All important parts of the modern socio -economic system, although they exist independently of one another, separated from their actual value.
Marx's thesis does not examine how a raw material gains its value exclusively from the work contained in this process. This could be presented as a critical disadvantage of the thesis, since it ignores a central perspective that changes the materialistic values ​​of society., which was not mentioned in Marx 'work, refers to the nature of goods, why some are valued more than others. The manifesto of the Communist Party and Marx' thesis forms a solid basis for the analysis of modern socio -economic relationships.
