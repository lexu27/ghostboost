This week concentrated on the second chapter of the textbook in which the nature of humans and culture is discussed. The first key point is the understanding that culture is the framework of life and influences the aspects of life for each individual (de Melendez & Beck, 2018). So everything a person does, how they perceive things, their dress code, preferences and dislikes, approach for social and political questions and interaction with others influenced by their own culture.How I look at people at work and in social spaces and relate to different cultures and create different cultures and styles.
It is crucial to find an explanation for the behavior of the classroom among learners. The second point from the text states that the manners, behavior and reactions of the students can be attributed to their culture (de Melendez & Beck, 2018).Therefore, acceptable actions of a learner can become unacceptable for another or the teacher. Since children learn their culture from birth, most of them will have the behavior of parents, older siblings and other close relatives accept.To understand students and plan the best experiences for every learner in the classroom.
Although culture belongs to society, there are differences between individuals in the same cultural groups. There are differences in a classroom in which every learner has a unique opportunity to express themselves and react to various topics.Or community different behaviors and manners (de Melendez & Beck, 2018). Solche differences come from socialization and individual distinctions. After I have read this chapter in the classroom, I will guarantee every student as unique and culturally different, which each of them isGet the best attention and direction during the learning process.
