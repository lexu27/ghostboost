The article recently describes an incident with the Hot Dog Restaurant in Chicago, which can be seen as an ethical problem. The incident included a man who was asked to wear a mask to use the services of the restaurant (Sutton, 2022).In response to it, the man insulted the restaurant employee by threw snow in the face several times (Sutton, 2022). In addition, the perpetrator broke the glass door with an unknown object (Sutton, 2022). This incident can be regarded as an ethical problem, since the actionsApart from the obvious crime of property damage, the perpetrator was disproportionate.
A utilitarian perspective would consider this incident to be incorrect by examining the consequences of the perpetrators' actions. The apparent reason for the behavior of the perpetrator is the request of the employee to wear a mask that is the mandate of the state.Decision of the restaurant's restaurant to commit a criminal offense against the employee and the property of the restaurant, starting with the consequences of these measures. Since the result was a broken glass door and an innocent employee who suffered, the consequences are harmful. From the point of view of the utilitarian perspective, the actions can be considered wrong. The Kantian moral theory is an issue as irrational, since it is rational behavior to follow moral law and the duty.Damage, can be immoral. The dismissal of the moral law makes the perpetrator irrational in the eyes of a follower of a Kantian moral theory.
I believe that utilitarianism is the most logical way to conclude this ethical problem. The reason why negative consequences for everyone can be the best moral compass for almost any decision.some people can be subjective. After Kantian theory, some people could not agree that the incident is an ethical issue. In contrast, a negative influence on a person after utilitarianism makes an action wrong.
