An unauthorized action refers to an omission or action that leads to damage/injuries to another person and corresponds to an injustice in which a person who was wrongly can get damages back (US Legal Inc., N.d.). In this caseThe unauthorized act hit Tom by a baseball that rejected it. It was then taken to the hospital due to the hit. Another unauthorized action was the fact that he had lost his possession when another fan stole his cell phone and wallet.is the last unauthorized action food powising, but only if Tom can prove that he had to stay at home for two weeks without work.
In the first injury, the stadium is liable because we are not informed that it has a disclaimer for the tickets that relieve the management of such injuries caused by flying balls (All Law, 2015). Secondly, the theft of its handset and walletare not associated with the stadium, so the stadium is not reliable for the theft of its property and the person who stolen is responsible. If Tom can prove that he has stayed at home for two weeksStadium. In the trap of the concealment of the brain, however, there is no liability in the stadium.
After all, in terms of Tom's case with food poisoning, it does not matter whether he bought a ticket or not. He bought a beer and a hot dog directly from the seller, he legitimately bought it from the stadium and the purchase was isolated from the ticket.Any other thing that happens like an accident or illness due to purchases should be legally valid and the stadium is still responsible.
