Guaman Poma experienced the injustices of the colonial government and suffered personally from the hands. He was the descendant of Inkan -Adligen, who grew up after the conquest of Peru by the Spaniards. My family was deprived of their countries and titles, and his attempts toto regain, continuously rejected the colonial government (Kilroy-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-ben, n. D.).A 1200-page illustrated document aimed at the Spanish king and recorded the Andean course before the invasion and the abuses they had suffered since the Conquistadors.
Poma's manuscript shows the full horror of colonialism and argues that the Spaniards were foreign settlers who had no right to take control of the country that God had given to Peruvian. He suggests a system of political organization, indem die Regierung für ihre Bevölkerung repräsentativ ist und sich an ihre praktischen Bedürfnisse angepasst hat (Kilroy-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-N.D.).POMA hat somit einen bedeutenden Beitrag zu den Diskussionen über Freiheit, politische Vertretung, soziale Verantwortung und Selbstbestimmung einzelner Staaten geleistet.His idea that the government should be created for and by the people who have historically occupied the country through which it rules is strikingly modern.
In addition, Poma's work refutes the idea that Europeans have brought civilization and political organization to the Incas. This interpretation is only shown as a hypocritical pretext to justify violence, economic exploitation and cultural extinguishing as a means of political control,How a whole lifestyle was completely destroyed and lost because his people were deprived of and forced to assimilate their freedom.have measured.
