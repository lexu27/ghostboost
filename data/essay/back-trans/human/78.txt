It is important to note that it is very common for a culture to not understand the condition of not being able to understand the internal struggles and subtleties of another culture.For example, for example, the book says: "People in America do not understand, but when an American chain is opened in a third world country, people are crazy" (Noah 188). As a person who lives in Canada,I embody the Canadian culture, in which most people from developing countries may not fully understand that a mere fast Fast food restaurant chain for regular consumers is not so exciting. The book also states that "Westerners are shocked and confused afterwards, but itis a case that the West harvested what it sowed. The colonial powers carved Africa, put the black man to work and did not properly educate him ‚Äù(Noah 194). In a similar way, many assume that Canadian people assumethe culture are overly polite, but I want others to know that this is not the case.
One of the most interesting aspects of the book is how certain tyrants are not perceived as such due to the lack of their relevance, which is why it also applies to current managers in Canada. In the text it says: "In Europe and America, yes, Hitler isThe biggest crazy thing in history, in Africa he is only another strong man out of history books "(Noah 196).However, it is not always true because they also face challenges for power struggles and are not always in the best interest of the nation, which are becoming increasingly clearer in the recent events.
