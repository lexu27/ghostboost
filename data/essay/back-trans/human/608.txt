The existence and the proper functioning of democracy are particularly dependent on the ability of society to connect and interact in their communities in order to solve preliminary questions. The author of the article "Bowling alone: ​​America's declining social capital" discusses and analyzes the manifestationsThe Civic Society of the United States of America by evaluating its change. The civil society as an expression of democracy has its social capital, which is characterized by the formation of social networks between people.The continuous consciousness and the interaction of the people involved in the community. In the crime, Putnam realizes that "such networks facilitate coordination and communication, reinforce the call and thus dissolve dilemma of collective action" (66).Companies that form networks will be able to facilitate the functioning of a democratic society.
However, the ongoing trends in American society point out a negative change in the willingness of people to deal in social networks and to interact with others for solving social problems. In the past decades, the number of clubs, organizational associations, units, religious networks and other forms of civic engagement significantly reduced. One of the reasons for such a deterioration in social capital is the development of mobility and residential property of people, which implies that they are often moved, and the lack of need, strong social bondsForms.Laut Putnam "Mobility usually increases the root systems, as is often re -packaging of plants, and it takes time for an uprooted person to put new roots" (72). Changes in the lifestyle of the Americans therefore have reduced social capital and network participationled, which ultimately could have a negative impact on promoting democracy in the United States.
