Morality as a system of hypothetical imperative is a work of the Philippa foot who tries to question Kant's idea of ​​morality. Kant claims that moral judgment cannot be a hypothetical imperative; instead it is a categorical and universal imperative.that morality should be represented as a system of hypothetical imperative, since morality does not differ from something else, for example the etiquette.
The idea that morality is powered by the categorical imperatives, implies that morality accepts a different kind of word. The comparison of morality with the etiquette claims that there is no significant distinction between the two (Foot, 1972). He draws an example of a person who does not take care of some label rules is not excused for violation of them (Foot, 1972). Foot comes to the conclusion that because morality and etiquette can use both categorical imperatives,It should be the etiquette and that should be moral assessment.
Next, Foot denies the reason for compliance with the moral rules. Laut Foot (1972) can be irrational a moral rule for a person who marks this person as amoral or evil;Reason, regardless of how it does it, for some reason, regardless of how the person does it, hypothetical imperative, not categorical (Foot, 1972) can and do people morally, even though they do not bind bindingFoot comes to the conclusion that there must be other reasons why people decide to stay moral (foot, 1972) if the moral judgment is a hypothetical imperative.Be charity, freedom and other virtues.
