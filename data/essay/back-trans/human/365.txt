The Net Pressing Value (NPV) reflects the amount of the cash that an investor or sponsor expects that it will be preserved from a project after the inflows can be reproduced through all possible costs.The repayment begins. NPV provides a clear indication of whether a project is worth investing in the likely costs and the potential risk.
The rules that apply to NVP include common sense and the appropriateness of the investment and take into account the return criteria. If the calculation of NVP includes a time horizon, this is already profitable compared to static measures.One expected value that will be less at the time of the investment. In contrast to the amortization period, NVP recognizes that the value of a currency is temporary and can change.Therefore, this metric is initiated in the calculation of the discount rates. Against that the NVP is calculated about the capital costs, and suggests a strategy for profitable opportunities to implement the project.Understanding the advantages of all available or a certain projects. A third -party advantage may be that the calculation of NVP takes into account the size of the investment. This means that NVP is a one -dimensional criterion that enables us to the degree of probability of creating prosperitybased on the number of cash flows.
Therefore, due to its application, NVP has several advantages compared to other investment criteria. First of all, NVP takes into account the cash value of the money that offers a clear picture of cash transactions. It is flexible and additive, i.e. it evaluates the capital costs and the appropriateness of the investment.One -dimensional indicator that takes into account everyone and even space investments.
