The first mention of a homosexual act can be found in the Old Testament book Leviticus. And it is said there in an unaffected way: "Don't put yourself like a woman: this is an abomination." (Leviticus 18:22) The apostle Paul says the following: "Just like men who have rejected natural intercourse with women, burn with pleasure: men do shameful acts with men and prepared the retaliation that they deserve because they went realization."(Roman 1:27) First of all when they talk about homosexuality - the sacred writings talk about" sexual intercourse "or" lust ", but not about the orientation in the sense that homosexual people have in mind today - an equal love relationship between twoPartners of the same gender. Homosexual relationships have been shared at any time and in all companies. However, the idea of ​​"orientation" as a property that is inherent in a specific person is relatively new; it only appears towards the end of the 19th century, which makes it difficult,to compare the phenomenon of homosexuality directly in the context of Christianity (Kuefler 1256). The second important point is the comparison of religious books of homosexual relationships with a relationship with women. Homosexuality existed in antiquity and in the Middle Ages - but it was never understood as an equal association.
In the Christian world, the execution should be for sodomites. In England, Sodomites were executed until the new time; homosexuals were long one of the goals of the Inquisition. The Code of Justinian in Byzantium presented serious punishments: until castration and the death penalty.In view of the high religiosity in the authorities, such persecution of religious overtones was supported. However, there was no such modern understanding of the association, even at the level of a philosophical idea: Such events were a deviation from the norm and were not fundamentally perceived.
