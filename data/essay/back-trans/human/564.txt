It should be noted that the drivers are not allowed to use handheld devices if their vehicle is stopped in a red light. The driving process is very demanding according to attention, which means that every form of distraction is a risk factor.distracted, and therefore the drivers lose the road from their eyes and the focus of the street and the signals of the movement. Handheld devices should be banned at any time for drivers, since stopping on red lights should also require the attention of the drivers.
The red light signal is a critical element of traffic safety and the efficient movement, especially at intersections. The state of Georgia killed a law that "makes it illegal to the drivers," physically keeping or supporting, with part of his body ", a wirelessTelecommunications device (Dyke and Smith, Para. 2). Only exceptions from the rule include "calls for reporting on a traffic accident, a criminal activity, a medical emergency or a dangerous condition" (Dyke and Smith, Para 3). The red light signal isAn essential part of traffic safety that does not remove the attention of a driver. A study suggests that “the use of the phone while driving leads to a reduction in situation consciousness and delays the reaction to the events in the mobile environment that can lead to accidents“(Choudhary and Velaga 351). With other words, the drivers slowly react to changes in light from the red signal to green. This leads to unnecessary delays in the traffic movement.
In summary, it can be said that due to the evidence mentioned above, drivers are not allowed to use their handheld devices during the red light signal, since attention is also required during stopping on the street. The delayed response time can lead to unnecessary traffic and overloadThe risk of accidents, since not all drivers react to changes in the light signals at the same time.
