One of the different characteristics of the nursing vehicle is the need for the specialists to constantly adapt to the dynamic environment of the healthcare system and the approaches to patient care.To systematize practices (Udod & Wagner, 2018). The two most widespread theories of change in nursing practice are Lewin's theory of change and Rogers Five -stage theory. In Lewin's framework, the change process is subjected to three main phases: vulnerability, change properly and refugee (Udod & Wagner, 2018). After this framework, the team must actively participate in the implementation of changes and new functional patterns and finally make the change into a new generally recognized standard.
In contrast to Lewin's approach, the model of Roger is geared towards the reaction and acceptance of the changes by the staff through the gradual shift process.of the change proposal (Udod & Wagner, 2018). The conclusion can be drawn that the model of Lewin mainly deals with the implementation of the evidence -proof modifications, the five -stage model is designed in such a way that the proposed change is advantageous for the clinical environment.
When you talk about the change proposal for the Capstone project, Roger's approach to change the implementation is more appropriate. In view of the fact that the project is trying to justify the hypothesis of the positive effects of EBP training on the self -esteem and patient satisfaction of the nurses, the data collected from the intervention for the further implementation of this change in nursing practice are of crucial importance. This theory has also proven to be advantageous by the teacher, since it has successfully integrated changes into the planning pattern of the staff with the help of Roger's model.
