Pressure ulcers often occur in the medical field and concern patients who are immobile due to illness or violation, or older people who normally have less mobility.The United States has remained relatively consistent and affected almost 3 million adults. However, the costs of health care have increasingly and pressure ulcers, if they are not treated, to serious health problems such as local or general infection or necrosis.of pressure ulcers results (Mervis and Phillips, 2019).
Pressure ulcers can occur both during the hospital stay and after the discharge during the home chewing. Many adults who may be immobile due to age, recovery, relaxation after the operation or other diseases are at risk of developing pressure ulcers.There is no regular presence for nurses to support the positioning, connections or identification of ulcers at an early stage.Using recommendations, pillow, pillow or mattress cushions to reduce the pressure and support the area (Medlineplus, 2020).
More complex interventions would be the use of print reduction surfaces. This is identified as permanent medical devices (DME) and used to maintain pressure ulcers and ulcers.Replace mattress or serve as overlay, include special mattresses, pressure cushions and overlays from foam, water or gel. Group 2 is similar, but contains more complex devices such as air flotation beds and driven print reduction mattresses.Use from filtered air (United Healthcare, 2021). Pressure -reducing carrier surfaces should prevent pressure ulcers or contribute to healing existing wounds. This is achieved by limiting the pressure of the tissue area to the best possible limit, mostly by improving the circulation and compliance with the contours of the bodyand the spread of pressure over broad areas of the body (RAE, ISBEL and UPTON, 2018). There is a general consensus between the literature that active and reactive carrier areas are effective for the prevention and treatment of pressure ulcers.
