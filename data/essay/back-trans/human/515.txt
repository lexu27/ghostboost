A work of art of art and its content is different and yet closely related concepts as well as its essential components. Laut Fichner-Rathus (2016) "is the topic of what with a artwork, places, things, topics, processes, events"(P. 4). This statement means that there are recognizable visual elements that are accessible to almost all people and can be perceived as something that represents or similar. ": The emotional, intellectuals, psychological, symbolic elements ”(Fichner-Rathus, 2016, p. 5). The content contains the special thoughts behind the work of art that can be understood by the topic.Nature from the topic and refers to ideas rather than the material world.
The contrast and the mutual dependency of the topic and the art content were seen in the sculpture tourists of Duane Hanson 1970.The obvious topic of this work is a few people, a man and a woman, both old age. They are dressed in bright colors and their clothes are similar to a stereotypical American clothing for vacation: the man wears a t-shirt with palm trees and has a cameraAnd the woman's wife, strong trousers for weekends and a spacious patterned bag. Beaders are able to wait or observe something.
However, the content of this work is more complicated than it seems. This people were probably average consumers of the time 60 when the author worked on the sculpture. They may come from the middle class and devote their free time for vacation trips in the decade in which there is no economic crisisthat would disturb them in such a way that they take part in the negligent and meaningless process of spending their money. So Hanson conveys the importance of problems and yet concerned with the details such as the clothes, the equipment of the couples and the attitudes a new experienceTo exist. The topic of the sculpture, namely tourists, is added to the idea of ​​ironing the lack of worries in normal people with economically stable status.
