Mercator is a frequently used projection, but does not represent the actual size of the country. The most common complaint is that the size of the country is extremely biased. The greats of Greenland and Africa are classic examples.The same size. The Mercator projection incorrectly exaggerates the size of Europe and North America. Gr√∂nland, which appears as a huge frozen country in the Mercator projection, has shrunk dramatically. The African continent has a much more important place on this new life -size card.Not only worrying, since they give the wrong impression of what the world looks like. In reference to non-white nations, Mercator extends the importance of white nations and may increase the meaning.
As far as I know, the actual size of a country differs from the size that is illustrated by the Mercator projection.will appear as a globe. This is completely avoiding the difficulty of the card projection and shows the planet in a circle (Setiawan & Sediyono, 2017). This means that countries and land are more precisely assigned. Users often use cards at closer zoom levels, e.g.B. for navigation with the Mercator projection. The exact angle between the lane and the border is obtained in this projection.
In an increasingly globalized world, a relevant geographical knowledge is of essential importance. Missing understanding of the size of continents can disappear if people get used to cards of the same area and the spherical earth. My view of the world changed when I realized that I realized thatThe Mercator projection was not exactly. I understand that the actual size of a country can differ from the size and the proportion shown on the map.
