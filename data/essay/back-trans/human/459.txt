Overpopulation in cities has become one of the most critical problems of our time. This is both an environmental and social problem. The city cannot grow indefinitely and provide decent jobs for every resident.Growth of the number of cities leads to the unchecked spread of pollution and the escalation of poverty. However, there are several preventive measures that the government can implement to combat this problem.
First, overpopulation is traffic jams and traffic jams, which leads to serious pollution problems. The atmospheric pollution is most serious in cities, and its main source is road traffic, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen in huge quantities.Groups in rural areas live in poverty (Innes et al., 2019). Added to them to settle down in the city because they believe that they can easily find work. The main goal is to take care of their family, but almostNone has the necessary training for a good job. This people come to the city and become a service class. They suffer from the prejudices of the indigenous people, the poverty and poorer working conditions. A further inconvenience due to overcrowding is the garbage that is difficultThis problem is to be disposed of (Namberger et al., 2019). This problem is solved thanks to the separate garbage collection (even in houses there are separate dashposes).
In summary, people should use public transport as often as possible to solve traffic and air pollution problems instead of using their car. The government should build more roads and improve public transport in order to solve this problem.The history of mankind, and all trends show that we will achieve consistent success in the fight against poverty in the foreseeable future.
