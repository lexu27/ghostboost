An choice that demonstrates the theoretical awareness of the author is the final scene in the first chapter of Maus when the narrator's father warns him not to be open to what he told about his youth.It is aware that most of his audience does not know first -hand over the Holocaust, and for them it would only be one side of history books. The repetition of the adventure of the adolescent of the youth of the main character, which is more understandable, and although he as a mouse,more human, this rhetorical choice enables the audience, which most likely did not know beyond the Holocaust beyond the high school history lessons to connect with the topic at a more personal level.
In addition, the fact that this scene is included in the chapter gives a denominational quality. In the scene, the father asks the narrator to leave what he has just told because he has nothing to do with the HolocaustAs personal information, by reading the chapter, readers already know that the narrator does not keep his promise, since the story is right there and is told both through drawings and text.that most of his audience would not have a direct and personal connection to the Holocaust, with the inclusion of this scene, the author feels the audience as if they were released from something personal and intimate, which promotes a better connection to the topic., to involve the episode with the narrator's father, who omitted the stories of his youth, is rhetorically aware of more than one sense.
