Aristotle made a discovery for all logic by introducing variables. It was shown that logic is not only a specific teaching of certain things or terms, but also the science of the laws of syllogisms such as mode ponens or mode -tollens that are in variablesTo be expressed. Setups of different judgments, formal logic abstracts from their specific content, which reveals a structure that is common for objects of different content.
Syllogism is the discovery of Aristotle and the main and original part of its logic. In the theory of syllogisms defined Aristotle defined syllogism and distinguishes its types, defined and non -working types of syllogisms and established three figures of Syllogism.Particularly interesting that Aristotle was the first method of argumentation on the subject of scientific research. He introduced the methods of argumentation as integral formations and not only certain argumentation components.and unification in a single coherent system. So concepts such as mode ponens and mode greats laid the basis for understanding the definition of the truth of thinking.Science approaches according to the inference rules, the opposition law and the exclusion of the third party.
Modern logic as an independent field of knowledge emerged from various sciences such as philosophy and mathematics. In the deed, however, a highly advanced concept, modern logic, some characteristic philosophical features - it is simple and technical.The originality of their new methods is emphasized compared to the previously used emphasis. In this sense, it is less interested in the discussion, since it is based on exact sciences and computer technologists and avoids ambiguities. The modern logic is based on artificial language and intelligence thatin itself compared to traditional concepts is rather boring.
