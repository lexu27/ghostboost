The researchers support their conclusion on three well -designed case studies that touch various software applications.., 2008).To check, however, can prove a challenge due to the high costs for the compilation of all samples and devices used therein (Pinzon et al., 2016).
The researchers are doing well to draw their interpretations and conclusions from the collected data that affect the three separate case studies mentioned above.In forensic science, research can have contributed significantly to reproducing the investigators (e.g. weapons position) and identifying the object used in the crime with improved precision and speed.that the use of haptics in forensic science can accelerate the punitive justice process and make investigations more reliable.
Research is very innovative because it facilitates the use of technology to reproduce crime scenes and enables the user to have lost the feeling of touching on such virtual excursions.Significant innovation is and the current technologies improved. According to Joukal et al. (2015), controversy in connection with the use of feels can occur because it was feared that operating systems and online hacking manipulate the investigative findings.Devices in the criminal justice procedure. In reference to ethics, the machines make investigations much more expensive due to the costly equipment and training for participating employees (Fahrni et al., 2019). In some cases, the costs can hinder the search for justice, especially inAreas with low incomes. Surely the innovation is obvious, and the researchers are good to draw solid conclusions based on their three well -designed case studies.
