The process of resolution revolves around the removal of the underlying causes so that the problem exists at all. Publication means to ignore the problem - to solve women who give the women who have a kind of compensationimpair without making changes and give them the means of defending themselves without actively trying to change the toxic culture in the direction of something better (Singh, 2018).Should it make it so that you don't have to.
From an organizational point of view, the transformation of the Nike culture should take place at all levels from top to bottom.
