Accountable Care organizations (ACO) were introduced to monitor and support Medicare and Medicaid programs. Since 2010, more than 900 ACO has concluded 1300 contracts with private and public hospitals across the country to manage payments from Medicare patients(Kaufman et al., 2018). In this model, health organizations are responsible for the costs and quality of the supply by creating a system with value -oriented payment.â€œWhat leads to improved care and cost reduction (Kaufman et al., 2018, p. 257). For example, the nominal savings were 700 USD per financial year per cancer patient (Kaufman et al., 2018). However, there was no significant cost reduction forSurgical interventions with the ACO model (Nathan et al., 2019). It seems that the benefit of this program for all specialties is not yet recognizable.High -quality supply is provided to maximize the cheap results.
Reliance Healthcare is an example of a successful ACO that has teamed up with emergency departments (ED) in Michigan to coordinate the care of Medicare patients. This organization consists of three groups: clinicians, IT team (information technology) and managers (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services [CMMS], 2020). The main goal of Reliance Healthcare In this partnership with EDS, it was to minimize the costs for health care by unnecessary hospital stays by organizing reliance health sisters, managers and IT -Departments (CMMS, 2020) are prevented. In the latest report, it was stated that this program could prevent an average of two avoidable approvals per day from 2014 to 2020, which leads to a significant reduction in costs (CMMS, 2020)That reliance Healthcare should continue to work with health service providers and put together more contracts, since unnecessary hospitalization in our hospitals is a major problem.
