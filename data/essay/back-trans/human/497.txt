Price bundling is a special strategy used by retailers to increase sales, dispose of less successful products and improve customer loyalty. This implies the sale of several items to higher margins and at the same time offers customers a discount (Baldwin, 2020). With other words, with price bundling, various products are offered as a package that is lower than the prices for each product when it is bought separately. It goes without saying that this strategy affects customer behavior as people prefer packages,which are guided by their prices, especially if all the articles contained are desirable. There are several examples of the bundling of price, especially in the food industry.Compared to the sum of the inclusive article prices are more cost -efficient.
