During my studies I learned the essentials of a great connection between crimes and the media that talk about these crimes. The main factor for this is that the media form the perception of people about the level of crime in a community and the reaction of the police.Frequent situation in which local media create the image of predatory world full of murderers and crimers, while the statics can say the opposite.To formulate results and rely on serious statistics on crime.
Modern American society lives in the world of numerous media in connection with the "new media" in forms of blogs, social networks profiles and personal websites.And believe in imaginable crimes (Surette, 2011, p. 217). This "fake news" can also set the perception of the event or a certain problem in the wrong way on the basis of inaccurate information.
Finally, the modern trend is that political polarization maintains the ideological differences between media sources. It creates the situation in which criminal proceedings in different media can be interpreted in different ways.Protests fatally shot 2 men, but the prison was avoided due to the court decision that it was self -defense.To provoke (Pollak, 2021). MSNBC left media published the blog entitled "Kyle Rittenhouse Trial was developed to protect white conservatives, killing" (Jones, 2021). It is obvious that the way,How an average person interprets the case is influenced by the selection of the media department.
