A western science has distorted the long history of African culture for centuries, and many of its basic principles have been considered by the lens of colonization.P'Bitek and Marimba discuss their works such as culture, spirituality, spirituality and philosophy of African nations and how Western ideology has converted its presentation without understanding its importance.Philosophy, religion and spirituality have disturbed the ability of the African people to identify themselves.
The ideas of scientists show that African culture does not differ from philosophy or drives a boundary between reality and spiritual nature of one's own being.should be used in objects.P'Bitek writes that culture is transformed from the "way of life of a person" into "something bought and sold" ("What is culture?" 14).Culture as a collection of souvenirs, not as parts of everyday life. At the same time, they are exposed to western religions that praise poverty and individualism (P'Bitek, "Man, unfree born" 21).Do not feel connected to traditional African society, but feel a gap between itself and European identity (49). A separation means that people lose their common and generation identification.
The measurements discussed above show that African and European ideologies come together in many ways and the latter take control of the presentation of the former. In theoremic, generations of people are removed from their culture, lose them or see the distorted lens of marketing. The African cultureis associated with philosophy, spirituality, life at the moment and the vision of life in life. However, it becomes a tourist attraction, and its people are forced to perceive them through the eyes of the foreigners and their inherent connection to history and natureto lose.
