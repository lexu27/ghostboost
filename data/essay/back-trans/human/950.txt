For me, Mexican culture is of course difficult to define in a paragraph or even in a whole essay. It is due to the multitude of nuances, influences and history that Meso -American civilizations such as Maya and Aztecs have many manifestations of Mexican culture -In art, food, customs, values ​​and religion, so if I would define Mexican culture, I would say that it is a unique mix of Meso -American heritage that are mixed with European cultural influences that are mixed with the linguistic and religious beliefsshaped.
In general, one of the first things that come to mind is religion. Mexicans are very religious, since some of the important Mexican holidays are religious, like the festival of Guadeloupe, which is celebrated by December 12thIf the Christianity of Azteken- und Maya civilization has been imposed, it later became an essential part of the Mexican belief system. Spirituality and family values ​​are also key characteristics of Mexican culture.Both values, since it combines all families to remember and honor relatives and friends who died. Souls come back to earth; therefore families prepare unique offerings to treat their ancestors.
In modern popular culture it is easy to imagine, the first associations that people have when they hear about Mexico.Select for Mexican culture: Costumes on the day of the dead celebration (1), the Mariachi band and the pyramid of the moon: Teotihuacán (3).
The day of the dead celebration represents the mystical, spiritual and family -oriented tradition that combines living people with the dead and establishes a strong connection to their own ancestors.
It is difficult to imagine music is a large part of Mexican culture because it represents the passion and spirit of the human soul.
Finally, the pyramids, which can be found throughout Mexico, symbolize the connection of Mexican culture with Meso -American civilizations.
