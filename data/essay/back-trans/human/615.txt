The selection of the ship is connected to the ongoing transport costs. Stopford (2009) claims that the best way to reduce the costs is to select newer ships for which fewer crew members are required, less maintenance and more reliable.If you do not automatically make new ships for the preferred selection for the shipping costs, as it looks, 65% of all cargo ships in the world are over 14 years old, which means that the competition for newer ships is intense (Cheng, 2021)Demand means increased costs, which was demonstrated by the increase in freight rates in 2021 and previously in 2016 (Cheng, 2021). Benid circumstances recorded an increase in demand for older ship services.
As a rule, the shipping costs offered are cheaper.Leading older ships consciously, consciously and have to compensate for them by offering a more advantageous price. In this case, certain running costs for older ships can be reduced by using inferior fuel on which these ships can still run (Ros Chaos et al., 2021).al., 2021).
Overall, since two thirds of the global freight are at risk of older ships, the conclusions of Stopford via newer ships that are better will argue. Such a conclusion seems to be obvious on paper, in reality a company with the changingTransport rates (which are higher for newer ships) that fight availability and a variety of other factors. If the shipments are common and cannot afford delays, the sender does not have to be with the best possible solution, but with what is available at hand,Take in. The chances are good that it is an older ship.
