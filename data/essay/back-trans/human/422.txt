In fact, globalization has become an important pattern in the development of geopolitical and cultural practices of the past decades. In terms of the advent of the Internet, people are also associated with continents: a powerful catalyst could not have any necessary consequence.Various countries and cultures are more integrated into a common, aspiring culture in which there is space for the traditions of all peoples. In the meantime, the representation of different cultures is unequal in this common common, which means that stronger national cultures can absorb weaker.
A natural reaction to the standardization of people was the growth of nationalist feelings among peoples whose cultures are rather weaker.In this way, globalization can lead to the destruction of sovereignty in need of protection: If the large powers (the United States, China, Russia, Great Britain) are the development of small neighboring (Hawaii, Hong Kong, Abbey or).Nationalism is not a problem because the communities protect themselves and want to preserve their cultural and political independence. However, radicals, violent measures on the part of the nationalists lead to international conflicts and inhibit globalization.
Therefore, globalization should not be evaluated whether it is good or bad.Incredibly integrated, since everyone learns from another continent, listening to foreign music and in a few minutes that cannot read improvement literature. This state leads to a new common culture.Governments have to confront.
