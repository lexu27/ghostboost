For decades, the perception of social equality has been intertwined by people with the phenomenon of not paying attention to ethnicity.essentially generalized in the United States and in the image of a Caucasian white man. At some point at some point the discrimination of everyone who was "the same" was only forced ethnic, gender and sexual minorities to sacrifice their identityThe result of such an assimilation is particularly alive among Japanese Americans and their mass asimilation, which aims to create the model minority (Shih et al., 2019)..
Such an ignorance should never be confused with equality to be the same.What people develop in their perspective on the world and critical thinking. Years of discrimination have eliminated the history of hundreds of ethnic minorities.Now it is now time to ensure that everyone learns and appreciates their ancestors in the same extent.However, never concentrate on creating exclusive communities that have nothing in common. The diversity is about learning your own values ​​together in order to find common properties without discrimination against minorities.
