The video of social media examiner (2021) in social media initiatives was most useful to me, since it offers more than twenty social media post ideas to improve the marketing of a company. This source shows that social media, namely FacebookBusiness and Instagram, have great power and improve marketing and promote organizations through contributions, stories, hashtags and user-generated content. The most useful information for me was trends, advantages and disadvantages, comparisons, direct offers and long forms.
Effective change in leadership is important if an organization wants to take on social media initiatives. A good guide is associated with effective communication, for example written content in social media. For exampleA hashtag like #Myinstagram logo and asked to share your views on the logo or another product or another service that the company offers (you ask, answer, 2018).Everyone understands them. They should lead their employees in the right direction and inspire them to change.
I can come across the following ethical questions: over -promising, subsequent and overvalued statements. I would try to give my customers honest information about the business and stop solving the first problem.Therefore, it is better to follow ethical principles and only promise if they can be fulfilled 100%.claims to deliver products from one country to another, it has to fulfill them. It will be a different other and thus lose their credibility.They help to attract new customers and to stay the old customers with the company they trust.
