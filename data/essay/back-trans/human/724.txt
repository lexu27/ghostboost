Woman with a parasol - Madame Monet and her son is a painting by the French artist Claude Monet, a founder and one of the most outstanding representatives of impressionism.The two figures of the painting are Monet's wife Camille and his son Jean.
The lower third of the painting shows a grass surface, and the other two thirds contain the figures of a woman and a little boy behind them. Monet's wife and child are the focus of the composition. The lower point of view enables the blue sky with white clouds behind theTo see figures to see what creates a unique flash effect (daily dose art). The figure of the boy is placed in the distance from the woman and also gives the painting deep. This composition technology leads the eye of the observer down, which for several other workswas common by Monet.
The use of colors and light in this painting is really impressive. The sun shines from the background and throws a shadow. The color lines are warm, bright and lively, together with the muffled shades of gray of the woman's dress.Whole series of colors around them: the blues of heaven, the yellow of the flowers and light, complementary lilies of purple (joy of the museums of virtual tours). Monet uses these colors and inattentive brush strokes to convey an atmosphere of an airy summer day.
Woman with a parasol is a genre painting that is a kind of art that represents normal people and their daily activities, so the painting gives the impression that mother and son have been interrupted during her daily walk on the field.The dress, the veil and parasol of the woman symbolize her status, and the grassy slope symbolizes the landscape that Monet preferred to the cities and industry. Overall, the painting creates a unique mood of a fleeting memory that is currently being captured.
