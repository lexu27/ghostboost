It was really surprising to read Gerai's report on the Dayak community, as it is an almost utopian view of sex and gender.Increasing the dayak recognizes the differences, but they see as an advantage. Reading the report almost seemed when the culture promoted the strengthening of both genders based on the characteristics that define them (i.e. the male strength, femalePersistence). This positive aspects are then brought together in order to contribute to the well -being of society and personal relationships in an almost egalitarian point of view.
It is difficult to believe, although there is very comforting to know that there are cultures.B. Gerai notes, the male strength is associated with aggression. I think it is correct that it is a question of the values, the values ​​that are taught by society are those that would issue people.Society gives a value for hypermascality and aggression as definitions of men, which are illustrated by the genitals and abusive actions such as sexual rule, attack or rape.
As shocking as this perspective may be, I agree that it reflects exactly the social element that has been created conservatively for rape for centuries, as already mentioned, rape is often attributed to natural biology, while in reality it is more the concepts of societyreflected. I think this perspective touches both, it emphasizes the natural properties of the sexes (power for men, femininity for women) and underlines their social characteristics (men are praised, women are used as used and broken). It can be argued thatIt is structured in our society, since certain connotations and stereotypes are associated with sexual violence. In a British study, the Label victim was connected to passive femininity, for example.Women are (but can be men) female characteristics and greater judgment (men would not be considered more than men). In the meantime, the accused who committed the rape is given the characteristic dimension of the prescribed masculinity.
