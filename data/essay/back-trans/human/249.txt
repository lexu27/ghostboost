The topic of the project in question deals with the formation of the effects of evidence -based practice (EBP) for nurses can have the scope of patient satisfaction with health services. In essence, the project is trying to achieve five main goals that both the well -being of nurses and well -beingof the patients in the hospital:
* The first goal of the project is to examine how the level of EBP knowledge and implementation of the nurses affects the quality of the services that they offer to patients.It is reasonable to assume that such an improvement will influence your motivation to carry out work dilts (Rodr√≠guez-Nogueira et al., 2021).investigate.
* The second goal of the project is to improve the overall level of EBP knowledge and the implementation among nurses in general hospitals.The latter still a capital for the clinical environment. In the deed, the EBP implementation remains one of the goals for many general hospitals.
* The third goal is to investigate the connection between the EBP training programs and the job satisfaction of the nurses. Labor satisfaction and motivation are some pillars of meaningful and efficient nursing practice and public relations. In addition to this reason, this project is to be determined to what extent the improvement of theExpert knowledge and self -confidence of the nurses contribute to their intellectual well -being and commitment to the job.
* The fourth goal of the project is to develop and practice a comprehensive and efficient EBP introductory training for the nurses in general hospitals. One of the many reasons for the lack of EBP implementation in the workplace is the inability of the nurses, enough timeto find for research and analysis. The presentation of a three-day training program that lasts almost six hours can display an insight into the patterns of a sensible EBP training in a busy hospital environment.
* The final goal of the project is to collect a comprehensive feedback on the satisfaction of the patients with the services provided by the nurses. Quality Health Care is one of the main goals of a clinical environment.Therefore, carrying out a survey on patient satisfaction is an advantageous way to get insights into the existing strengths and weaknesses of the nursing staff.
All goals for the project mentioned above focus on the integrity of services that have provided the patient.Assuming, regardless of the personal beliefs and qualities of the individual and the subjective attitude of the nurses.Compared to the patients (sultana et al., 2020) sometimes, the burnout and lack of specialist knowledge among nurses influence the autonomy of patients or the right of patients to take part in the decision -making process and treatment.and pay attention to non -medical factors of the patient. The lack of EBP experts and the prevalence of burnout contribute to poor interaction with patients, this project will help to restore the autonomy of the patients in the workplace.To examine options in order to minimize the level of personal concerns and their potential effects on the socially identical and respectful treatment of patients.
