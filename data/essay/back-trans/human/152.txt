It is undoubtedly of great importance to be a knowledgeable and experienced specialist in the professional area. For this reason, many students of medical training try to acquire as much theoretical and practical specialist knowledge as possible before completion.I recently found that the real success in the work of the health service providers is explained by the doctor's ability to build up relationships with the patient. I understood the advantage of these simple but often overlooked truth when IWang's work observed.
Dr.Wang is an experienced specialist who works in the area of ​​eye surgery, but it was surprisingly to discover for me how easy he/she is able to build close relationships with the patients. After I had analyzed their behavior, I stated that I stated,that there are certain skills that Dr.Wang enable the trust of the people who come to the Eye Surgery Institute. First he/she is an active listener, which means that all patients from Dr.Wang can be encouraged to completely express their symptoms and feelings without being interrupted. Secondly, Dr.Wang always politely and patient with people, regardless of their general mood. I finally noticed that Dr.Wang is friendly with regular patients because she is interested in her health and everyday life. For example, I heard how Dr.Wang a woman about her daughter's health because the patient mentioned that the latter was sick during the last session.
As a result of such an attitude towards people, I saw that many treated people openly with Dr.Wang could share when they trusted her. I saw again that this made it possible for the specialist to provide better and more precise treatment.by Dr.Wang's practice will also inspire other current and future medical employees to develop their communication skills.
