Agesmus is a global problem of discriminatory and stereotypical people due to their age. Addresses in society, has a psychological influence on the individual and creates biased attitudes into certain population groups (Ayalon & Tesch-Römer, 2018).Responsible for the stereotyping of different age groups, especially older adults. This is aimed at discussing two examples of Agesmus and an example of a positive characterization of older people in the media.
Clichés and stereotypes about older adults in advertising measures lead to negative attitudes in humans when they present unrealistic and inadequate messages to the audience. For examplecan do it because you have not managed to save enough for retirement (advertising TV, 2018). This stereotypical video is aged because it supports bias and discrimination against older workers, financial people and older people in generalAgesmus is an advertisement, "dear young people, no coordination" in which older adults urge young people to vote (Nail Communications, 2018).The inaccurate and discriminative is. A positive example includes an advertisement from DocMorris, in which an older man persistently exerts on his granddaughter to help her put a star on the Christmas tree (Sport for Business, 2020).This video is respectful, supportive and heartwarming because it can achieve an older person who can achieve goals and lead a fulfilling life.
In conclusion, Agesmus has harmful effects on the perception of older people in society. Delicate examples of the representation of the media of the older people discussed in this article devalue the skills of older humans.However, there are also positive examples that are not characterized by the Agesmus. They do not promote misunderstandings and prejudices and form a healthier and supported attitude towards this age group in society.
