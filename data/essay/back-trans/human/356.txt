inspiration
In Diamonds, Rihanna thought about the existence of love and diamonds: “Yellow diamonds in the light. To make things even more unpleasant, we stand next to each other. You cross my way like your shadow.“The diamonds in the song symbolize a silver site that shows the chance for a better future and happier days under dark and depressing days. This song made me think about all available opportunities if things do not turn out as expected.
I also selected the song because his presentation was both positive and hopeful, and I am always in a good mood when I hear it. It is also quite inspiring because it encourages the listeners to love themselves.The song has won several awards and has been massive for years. For Rihanna's career, the song gave a big thrust because it was quite catchy and everyone could see it from the first few minutes.
