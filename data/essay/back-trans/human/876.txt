Although crime in Reading, Pennsylvania, remained high despite the city's budget restrictions, police chief William Heim invested considerably in the crime forecast software in 2013.The predictive police are the name of this Big Data Start Program Up (short for the predictive police). How would the program be used to analyze previous crime data to determine where and when will most likely scream every hour.Sank by almost 20%when the police paid more attention to these hotspots.There are many data about the region to justify the presence of the police there.
It has been found that human initiatives create excitement and danger in population groups in need of protection. Mathematical models are currently dominating the prosecution. Beyond ideas that relate to violent crimes to an increase in violent crimes, police chiefs are of the opinion that even "disruptive data" can be usedto create “better data” that can focus more on violent crimes. Police services across the country strengthen the rules for violence and non -violent crimes by relying on data from predictive police methods. One of the most dangerous aspects of this system is that its innerWorking before the general people are kept secret.
At a "hackathon" in spring 2011, O'Neil and the New York Civil Liberties Union worked together to uncover important information about the controversial and destructive stop-and-freight program of the NYPD. Many blacks and Latin American teenagers were falsified on the basis of data, although only 0.1% of the fris clings were associated with a serious crime in any way. "Stop and frisk", argues O'Neil in his book, is not a WMD, but it uses mathematics to take thousands of intrusive stops in protectiveTo justify communities. Obviously, people administered it, Stop and Frisk led to terrible feedback loops, which were disproportionately punished for black and Latin American males for minor violations.
The police are likely to target in areas with low incomes on non-whites in which access to excellent schools and workplaces is missing. In the following, judgment recommendations based on WMDs such as predictive police and relapse models are both racistically discriminatory and logically faulty. In these modelsThere is no consideration for human nature who claim to have an abundance of information about the probability that ex-duplication from a certain area after discharge from prison is again insulted.Understand prison life and how this affects the behavior of the inmates. Many occupants suffer from malnutrition, solo and sexual assault in prisons. If these institutions reach the total capacity, they can generate an industry of $ 5 billion.To make prisons mysterious, these companies make every effort to do this.
In the not too distant future, facial recognition algorithms can identify even more dangerous weapons of mass destruction. The Chicago police authority knocked on the door of a 22-year-old man in 2013, which in an area with low incomes with high crimes.who were not involved in criminal activities, she began the racist tensions in the communities in which crimes were a problem. If it is more accessible to build models that suspect that everyone is the same as the development of guidelines thatmake the judicial system more fairer (albeit less efficient).
