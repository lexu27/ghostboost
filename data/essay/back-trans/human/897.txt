Social behavior is a complex of behavioral patterns that are typical of the largest part of society at a certain time. There are different types of them, but everyone is characterized by a lack of specific structure, even in deliberately organized movements.Various influences between the members of all social movements.the creation, organization and dissolution of social movements, which enables much faster information exchange.
Social movements are different and social media, they all influence them directly. Funconed movements are initiated by some changes in the world that are influential for people: for example, financial crises, wars or even some rumors about important events.: The outstanding example was the case at Sony and Apple in 2010.There were many contributions on Facebook and other social media about the hypothetical plans of Apple to acquire Sony (types of collective behavior - introduction to sociology: understanding and change of the social world, 2016). They were not true, but led to an increaseSony's share price, which shows how easily social behavior can change under strong stimuli and due to the rapid spread.
So you can see that social media is much easier to create and resolve social media. It makes it easier to exchange information, and therefore all events can quickly become known to many people via social media contributions, online messages and blogs.that the social movement, which is created in response to a stimulus like rumors about a large company, will be formed immediately and its consequences will also show very quickly.
