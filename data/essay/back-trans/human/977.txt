America is a large continent on which a large number of different nationalities and representatives of different breeds, genders, orientations and ethnic groups live today.Interaction influenced. I had many encounters with people who reflect the diversity in my everyday life. That influenced me as a personality and contributed to the values ​​and views for discrimination that I have today.
I remember that my family and I moved to a district in which the prevailing party of our neighbors were black people when I started to go to school. Many of my classmates were also afro-Americans, which for the first time for meAs a child was surprising that it has never been in a group of people who are so different at first glance than me. In this moment I had the feeling that it was the only difference in our appearance. After a while I metSo many interesting and friendly people with different backgrounds. This taught me that the personality of an individual does not depend on the color of their skin, ethnic background or their nationality. I am grateful for the fact that I am in the early phases of mineI recognized life.
As a person who is against discrimination, it is a shame to see how people only because of their skin color, their ethnicity or other characteristics that differ from these people could remove people from minorities.Irrite, and I assume that people who impose discrimination on today's society should be more open -minded and find out about diversity and equality.
