The percentage of people in my state in Washington, which is not insured, is one of the lowest. In particular, it was 6.6%from 2019, which is considerably lower than in Oklahoma (14.9%) or Texas (18.4%) (Kaiser Family Foundation, n.d.). In my opinion, the connection between the socio -economic status and access to care is obvious. Ye less options have a person in terms of financial provision, the less possible it is that they provide high -quality health care. PersonalLow incomes are most likely not insured or justified for Medicaid. In theoremic, such citizens do not seek health care as often as they are needed. In emergencies, they only address specialists and neglect many other problems that require prevention or treatment.
I think the main reason why the percentage in my state is low is its geographical situation. There are many employment opportunities in the state of Washington, which means that people can afford health insurance.Options with regard to health needs well informed.
When I talk about the quality of care and access to health care, I should also find factors such as ethnic differences, access to education and community context. In my state it is easier for people with different background to take support and find support.However, there are parts of the country in which some ethnic groups with prejudices could be accepted, which makes it difficult for them to pursue high -quality education and find well -paid jobs.
