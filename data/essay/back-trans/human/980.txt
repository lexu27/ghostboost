The ideas of income and prosperity may not be merged as economic concepts.an equal distribution of capital, which leads to the question of whether the economic equality should be defined by the equality of income or this assets. Since equality suggests the same opportunities for power within society, the level of prosperity seems to be the main factor,which defines the prosperity to a considerable extent.Income also plays an important role in building democracy.
When considering democracy as an opportunity for all citizens to participate in the design of state politics and to achieve political influence, one could combine prosperity with democracy. Ins view of the fact that wealth as a long -term asset within a political influence within aCommunity defines, the same distribution of the assets implies the promotion of democracy (Mijs, 2021). However, could argue that the development of the same assets is impossible without the same income.Drastic inequality of the assets remain a social problem (Le et al., 2019). This could argue that democracy requires equality of prosperity, which in turn is based on the equality of income.
While equality as the existence of equivalent possibilities to exercise political power seems to be the main factor for creating democracy, the equality of income as an opportunity to build up is also a factor.One seems to be an egalitarian community, both concepts play a significantly major role in promoting the principles of democracy within a community. In terms of information, both income equality must be regulated as a short -term opportunity, power and equality as a long -term option for storage, accordingly.
