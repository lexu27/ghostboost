The video "Eye of the Storm" is a fascinating example of how breed can be constructed in the classroom.)., whereby the eye colors serve as symbols to emphasize the breed and group of the group.
As a result of such a distinction, differences in the activities and performance of the students were obviously.It was reported that the latter became more shy and shy, supposedly intimidated by the pressure of the other group (flower). Blue -eyed children felt less calmed down, with their academic performance and their relationships with their former classmates with brown eyes (became worse (Blow). At the end of the activity, a drastic difference between the two groups was remarkably clear, and the struggles between the learners were often seen.
What struck me the most in this experiment was how quickly the changes in the behavior of the children became obvious.Behavioral patterns soon formed and show how easily children can involve the new rules in their daily life. From this perspective, teachers and adults should be exceptionally careful if they raise children on various topics, since the results of such a learning can be devastating.
