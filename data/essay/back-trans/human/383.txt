Kantic ethics is the clearest example of non -consequent theories in philosophy and in a further sense.And ethical phenomenon demonstrates that he formulated and referred to as a categorical imperative.
This concept, designed by Kant, is the wording of how a person should act, and strives to participate in really moral behavior (Kant & Abbott, 2021). The imperative deals directly with the acting person, the specific moral decisions in accordance with the given rational speciesIf a person is advised to treat the maxims of their behavior, namely the subjective rules of practical reason, strictly and urgently, most carefully. According to Kant, the principles of pure practical reason have a specific non -consistent form (Kant & Abbott, 2021)There are statements that contain a general definition of will that are subject to many practical rules. This term has special problems essentially of the statement.
It should be discussed how Kant understands the ethics more precisely. Moral should not be relatively, bound to private interests, but absolutely and universal; otherwise it does not exist at all (Kant & Abbott, 2021). With other words, relativism is the enemyThe real morality, the contingency of the principles and the adaptation to the situation. In this aspect of Kant's philosophy, the conflict between the basic, strictly necessary, universal moral law, the Kant defends, and the always determined circumstances, the actions of certain people,A particularly sharp form. This conflict is at the top of the non -consistent ethical position of Kant. Of course, a certain person cannot live and act than to concentrate on the circumstances and build up their own subjective maxims of behavior.To guide only one idea and a chimera from universal morality and in this case the universal moral law - the categorical imperative.
