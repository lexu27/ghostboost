An initial reaction speed is an instant rate at the beginning of the answer. The graphic has the Y- and X-axis, Y stands for the concentration of mol per liter and X for the time in seconds. In this case the chemical reaction goes back to time; At the beginning of the reaction, the chemical concentration is very high and is therefore considered a positive reaction. The slope decreases with the time and results in a negative curve; the reactant concentration is therefore reduced within a period of time.
The immediate rate is an immediate rate with the difference rate, the reactant against the time.P. 3154).
The reaction speed calculates the average over a time interval by shared the change in concentration of the moles per liter overtime per second period after period of time.A minus sign means if the rate of the previous equation is positive. The minus sign is not necessary to calculate the average rates of the products used.B shared according to G to get the standard. Finally, the concentration of the birthmarks per liter was high at point A and time 0 at the beginning of the reaction, while the engagement was low at point G.
