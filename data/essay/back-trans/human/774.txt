The screaming, once associated with toughness, strength and strength, is now considered an impressive and aggressive, a negative side of arrogance and the exclusive advantage. With the widespread public response to the online clip of the Republican majority leader, Jake Corman, screams hisDemocratic opponent Kate Muth, the precarious position of screaming in modern American consciousness was obvious. Current is currently associated with toxic masculinity and trouble problems that often result from it.and humiliation is not a reasonable approach for anyone who wants to achieve public respect and to be taken seriously.
A large part of this movement is undoubtedly due to a broader trend of behavior that promotes abusive and obviously patriarchal structures, if it is no evidence that men scream more than women, is a man who screams, almost always a physical and psychologicalDangerous experience. Another element of the transition seems to be reasonable in order to assign a shift in the generation -level temperature that may be supported by the rise of internet culture (Petrusich, 2019).It is simple, cruel, abusive and disruptive, other communication channels.
Personally, I find the development of understanding of writing quite fascinating. Social connotations of behaviors are not determined, but develop depending on the condition of society even over time. Since the general public becomes more respectful for each other, it is at least hypothetically natural thatIt is a little overhauled. I only hope that respectable people can deal with the previously conveyed emotions that previously scream in a healthy way instead of suppressing them as long as possible.
