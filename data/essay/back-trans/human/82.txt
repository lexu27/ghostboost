One of the most important aspects of the evaluation includes the risk analysis and the target setting, both of which enable a clearer direction and more detailed as well as the focused planning process.
The evaluation meeting begins with the risk assessment process, in which a consultant asks a client whether he or she has suicidal thoughts or not. Regardless of the answer, the video shows that the consultant asks the customer to report whether it will have such inclinations (dr. Death Grande, in 2016).Through questions about the goals of the life of the client in general, to which they react with "nice, convenient work" and "better future for their children" (Dr. Todd Grande, 2016). A more specific goal must also be identified, z.B. become drug -free. The third part of the target setting includes goals specifically for advice itself, which is also evaluated by the achievement of the achievement, which cannot range from any self -confidence to complete trust. The very last part deals with questions to the consultant andThe structure that is informed.
In summary, the core elements of the risk assessment include the survey of risk factors such as self -harm, damage to other and drug -related problems.
