I have selected these internships because they are all designed for a medical assistant. This is asked in different areas of medical services.I would like to receive a medical department in a large medical organization for the first internship. I would like to strengthen my examination skills for the second internship. In the third internship, my goal is the practice to determine diagnoses. The fourth internship enables me to carry out independent treatmentThe advantage of the fifth internship for me will be that I can learn how to work closely with a doctor.
I plan to apply for the first internship because it meets my need to get the lack of knowledge. If I can apply for the second internship, I can acquire the skills that a medical assistant needs.To apply for the third internship, as I can use the necessary manual skills in practice.
