The problem in my life is whether you can improve memory through a game. If I am a student, I have to memorize a lot of information these days, and I have found that traditional methods are not always effective.that there is a good chance of improving memory if you can find the right kind of games because games find the right games.be very good and advantageous activity.
I would like to further investigate how Play Innovation promotes and which mechanisms are responsible for this connection. As a driving force of progress, innovative thinking is applicable in all areas of life. However, it is not easy to imagine a practical idea that the life of peoplewould change the better.

My question for the class discussion is why the opposite of the game is depression and which psychological mechanisms could be responsible for this connection.
