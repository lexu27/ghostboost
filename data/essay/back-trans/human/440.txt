It is important to note that brain tissue is one of the most complex and complicated structures in the human body, which has a very limited capacity for healing and regeneration. The subject of the proposed research is to assess how neural stem cells replace and other brain cellsDifferentiate to use them for therapeutic purposes. N -EURAL tribes cells must be used as a therapeutic measure to slow down or stop the aging process due to its rejuvenation and differentiation capabilities.

literature review
Part 1
The preliminary investigation suggests that there is a complex system of regulatory steps that contain the GABA signal transmission. There are a number of signal molecules that are on the neurogenesis of the ventricular subventriculation zone (V-SVZ) such as Schalliser, fibroblast growth factor 2, glutamateand others are involved. The subgranular zone (SGZ) is another important nuclear region of the adult human brain, and the mechanisms of regulations are comparatively different between V-SVZ and SGZ.
Part 2
For example, a key source of the proposal states that "V-SVZ-NSCs are regulated by local signals from their immediate neighbors as well as by neurotransmitters and factors, which are secreted by distant neurons, the choroid plexus and the vascular system" (Oberier & Oberier & Oberier& Auberier & Auberier & Oberier & Oberier & Oberier & Oberier & Auberier ‚Äù(Oberier & Alvarez-Buylla, 2019, P. With other words, wide-lying cells dissolve a wide range of signal molecules to produce, differentiate and regeneration processes of the neural stem cellsto regulate.
