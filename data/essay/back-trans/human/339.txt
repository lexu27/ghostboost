The aviation industry was particularly hard hit by Covid 19.The virus outbreak has caused the governments of most countries to implement restrictions on traveling (effects of COVID-19-pandemic on aviation, 2022).Passengers due to the test regulations, limited resources and the lack of need to travel to travel for work is less interested in traveling. Another cause was the regulation itself, which implied a reduction in covid-19 cases through quarantine measurements.led that the airlines have lost income (USD 372 billion), which was an unprecedented change in the industry (economic effects of COVID-19 on civil aviation, 2021).
The flights were canceled and the employees were released due to the challenging situation in which the companies could not maintain any airports with such a low passenger rate.were offered fewer seats (-50%), and fewer passengers were able to travel via the aircraft (-2.7 billion) (economic effects of Covid-19 on civil aviation, 2021).the transport of medical care was less affected or even increased (Nižetić, 2020, p. 10953).
However, since vaccines have been available and fewer restrictions were introduced, the situation has changed in 2021.Due to the less strict regulatory implementations, vaccinations and other advantageous factors, there have been more options. As in the relevant literature, the lost income in 2021 were slightly lower ($ 324 billion).2021 has a slight improvement, since the years are certainly better and better.
