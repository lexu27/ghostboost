Firstly, I argue that social movements sometimes not only use disruptive behavior, but are of course annoying. Social movements usually occur when the existing institutions - elections, political parties and government agencies - are unable to solve obvious problemsSo social movements serve as an instrument of direct democracy, which articulates certain positions and forwards the authorities. In this way, social movements disrupt an ideal model of liberal democracy in which the citizens vote for the candidates, which in turn represent them in government bodies.
Therefore, the disturbing nature of social movements enables marginalized and underrepresented social groups to speak and hear. This term applies to all sides of the political spectrum, which makes social movements valuable for the democratic political system.The right-wing anti-globalism aims to protect national sovereignty and restrict immigration (Greenberg et al., 2018).Various identities and promote political pluralism.
Second, it is necessary to separate the disturbing nature of social movements from specific disruptive tactics that you use to promote your agenda. For exampleThey are in the message - while the civil rights movement has actively tried to attract people from the outside, BLM had to struggle with the message of inclusion (Clayton, 2018).Martin Luther King's rallying scream "We will overcome" many non-black sympathizers, so that Blm would probably benefit from a more integrative approach.
