A mutation is a change in the genome of an organism. The most common mutations are defined as changes in the DNA structure that occur due to a disturbance of the sequence of genes or the development of new genes. In this article I would like to talk about spontaneous mutations. Spontaneous mutationsCoincidentally - for example when a sheep is suddenly born in a flock of sheep with shorter legs; such mutations can also occur in humans. The ADAS ADRB1 gene, for example, is responsible for regulating the amount of sleep that a person needs every night to properlyTo work. The most people need eight hours of sleep or more, but about 5% of the population enjoy a slightly different mutated version.Testes on a mother and a daughter who had the mutation, showed the ability to only 4 to 6 hours a nightTo sleep (servick, 2019). This mutation refers to a kind of genomic mutation. The protein encoded by the mutation is a receptor for noradrenaline.
This mutation is dominant, autosomal and advantageous in its effect on the viability of individuals. Changes of the ADRB1 gene mainly occur in humans. However, they can also be in animals, although no studies have yet been carried out.The human population in the general world is mainly due to the fact that it is not dangerous and is not life -threatening for its carriers. A mutation is therefore only a positive addition to the living skills of a human carrier. This mutation is sporadic and despite itsDominance No dominant trend in the changes in the population genome. I find this example interesting because natural changes in human genome open up new possibilities for the population.
