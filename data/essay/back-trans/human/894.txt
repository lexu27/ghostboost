In view of the exponential growth of users of intelligent devices, the data volume increases from various intelligent devices that differ depending on the basic V to classify them as a big data.determined to process the massive amount of data that is generated by various intelligent devices to give consumers quick response times. This service provider usually employ Hadoop and Spark for processing massive data records for this reason (Chaudhary et al., 2018)underlying infrastructure, however, was less observed, which is one of the most important aspects for the effective conclusion of a specific solution in this context.
