Unfortunately, women can take a risk of pathological menopause. It is necessary to take into account which specific features can make the problem worse.If, to illuminate the symptoms of previous menopause, it would also be helpful to keep a diet and give up smoking.
Admittedly, in the event of menopause, the hormone level of a patient and the BMI are measured in order to find out whether there is the possibility of serious impairment. According to the latest studies, "sex hormone levels after menopause later in life are connected to the increased CVD risk of women" (asin J am Coll Cardiol, 2018, pp. 2555–66). It sounds sensible that the under analysis of the lower patient should discontinue the Norvasc recording due to its side effects, which in the long run causes the risk of heart disease, since theMotor activity is reduced. As a beta blocker, Metoprolol is a precise decision for this special case.
However, the patient's obesity status is better being covered before a precise diet is prescribed. Banack and your research team carried out a research, the results of which “show that a BMI cutting point of 30 kg/m 2 is not a suitable indicator for the status of oneReal obesity is in women after menopause ”(Banack et al .., 2018). It means that fast weight loss can be useless and even harmful.that SSRIS/SNRIS are less effective than HRT that can reduce hot flashes and be recommended for women who want to avoid the risks of HRT "(Stubbs et al., 2017).it increases the risk of cancer.
In summary, it can be said that the author's recommendations will probably lead to a successful treatment of the symptoms of early menopause. The proposal to replace Norvasc with metoprolol seems to be a reasonable decision.This is why SSRIS/SNRIS can prove to be the right approach for treatment with hot rinsing.
