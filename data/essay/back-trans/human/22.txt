The film, which was observed to consider a number of cases of violence or abuse, is for colored girls. The type of abuse that is removed from the film relates to rape.was raped by her grandfather (Perry, 2010).
In the beginning it is important to evaluate the mental state of tangie that can be carried out according to a number of conversations. The latter should be carried out with tangie and their closest people who can illuminate the situation., how the abuse mentioned has taken place, as well as to which tangie will probably take place now.
After this information has been obtained, the care plan is to be developed and implemented. In the first stage, regular conversations with tangie are implied that cover the topics of their feelings and the view of the tragedy. Then it will be important to separate them into a group of those, which have been raped that it will participate every week. Tangia should support itself around her so that it can give up the feeling of loneliness. This could reduce the possibility of constant depression and avert some severe mental trauma.
During the entire care plan, it will also be crucial to inform Tangie about how the stress is due to the rape. During the planned plan, it is provided with the recognized literature in this area. The most important points are discussed with me and in the group.It seems critical to surround them with an environment in which people will hear and listen to them.
