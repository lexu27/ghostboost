The main effects of Covid-19 pandemicism on companies on companies are reflected in the chaos that this pandemic caused the global supply chains., do not deliver extremely high freight rates and displaced shipping containers.
The most important effects of pandemic and the changes within the business environments can be seen in small companies. This can be seen in the example of the growth of Amazon, which was selected at the beginning of the pandemic., the majority of consumers decided on online purchases to satisfy their needs, and then customers ordered most of their articles online, including food, clothing, personal objects and other things.To deliver from supply chains, while small inpatient shops were forced to close because they could no longer have any more profits for months.accuses of using data from its small suppliers to popular postMer items and sold under Amazon brand. The internet retail giant has the resources and skills to overshadow every small company, which is very difficult for small companies even in the post -pandemical periodmight.
Obviously, the lack of the company's ability to maintain goods from suppliers is one of the greatest threats to grow and develop the company.Dedicate the creation of effective supply chains. If the freight rates decrease to their previous levels, the managers may want to rethink where they buy their goods and select local suppliers to the states in China or the states of development.And if you take into account the ongoing problems with programs, the companies are currently experiencing, the higher costs of the local suppliers can now be compared with the low production costs in overseas in combination with high shipping rates.
I think these changes in the nature and consumer behavior of the supply chain will be permanent, and companies should prepare for the new challenges. Especially in the two years in which pandemic was active, consumers have got used to it, articles mainlyTo buy online. This is enabled both conveniently and also to save time and effort.It is unlikely that consumers will return to the offline purchase if all restrictions are canceled. In terms of companies, many managers had to find paths to support their operation when the supply chains were disturbed. This enabled new approaches during thePandemic to thrive, and it is possible that these business models will continue to be used in the future. This will most likely prevail the changes caused by the pandemic in the business environment.
