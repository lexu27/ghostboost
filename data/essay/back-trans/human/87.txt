The importance of writing and the narrative for coping with guilt, loss or trauma is mainly expressed by two literary devices. The first is the irony: situation and verbal. The irony is a satirical technique with which the writer evaluates the topic thatDouble meaning includes the truth is not in the statement, but in its opposite meaning. The author uses verbal irony to convey the emotions of the characters more in more detail. "Now they stay on the salad while the rest of us suffer" (121). This type of irony is used to condemn the behavior of the narrator. Such a writing structure is a way to commit yourself guilty in the actions that cause the suffering. "When the wounded screamed, you have dreamed of somewhereto share a small house ‚Äù(227). This quote also contains the narrator's conviction on their actions against loved ones.
The narrator who creates a novel wants to give characters the opportunity to live life that they had no chance of living.becoming, and the narrator has no chance of being awarded, so she creates a novel in which she can pay for her sins. The situational irony is used to present the narrator's repentance that tries to use the writing to use withto be finished.
