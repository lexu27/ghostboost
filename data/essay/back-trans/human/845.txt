The main difference in relation to different gender theories is how they explain the gender differences in the behavior that are characteristic of both genders. In terms of the problem of behavioral problems in men, different theories find their causes in different sources.In male students through the concept of male nature as of nature and of course competitive, aggressive and even violent (Tilling, 2013). This essential theory contradicts the now well -established understanding that some people in relation to delinquencyHowever, social influences are a far more important cause (Delcea et al., 2019). In contrast to biological determinism, the social construction of gender theory is that people enact gender -specific behaviors if they learn them from others and gender standards ininternalize their cultures (Tilling, 2013). This approach would explain the correlation between the male gender and behavioral problems through the promotion of aggressive ideas of masculinity by Western cultures that promote bullying (roses and nocty, 2019)., explain behavioral problems in men, they are looking for answers.
It is obviously relevant to know and understand these gender -specific theories, for more than one way for lessons. First of all, it is almost impossible to tackle behavioral problems efficiently without understanding their cause and, above all, gender -specific theories thatin the scientific community for a long time, still strongly influenced by the public. A example would be the mythopoetic men's movement, which despite all the criticism of the latter is strongly based on biological determinism (Tilling, 2013).Also crucial for understanding the way people can rationalize their behavior.
