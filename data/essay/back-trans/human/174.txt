Many countries are always multicultural, and doctors accept patients with different sociocultural background. So there is an increasing need for intercultural communication between people. In health care, it is particularly important because people discuss issues in connection with medicine, illness and even life life.Interaction between doctor and patient is associated with increased satisfaction of patients, compliance with recommendations and results and improvement in health (Purnell, 2002). If the socio -cultural differences between patients and doctors are not examined and brought into practice, this canlead to dissatisfaction of the patients that lead to non -compliance with recommendations and harmful health consequences.
