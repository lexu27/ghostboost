The current global landscape of the agricultural economy consists of large companies. In fact, its presence is widespread to dictate and formulate guidelines and standards within the industry (Chemnitz et al., 2017).How environmental damage, violations of human and labor rights and even lack of effort to minimize poverty. During the extent of the problem, the extent of the problem seems too great to clarify, changes in the purchase habits of consumers have the potential to promote diversity in such industriesHowever, if only a small fragment of a series of interventions that are necessary, the most important change that is missing comprises the presence of the government.
The most interesting aspect of the reading for me was the focus on how the current size of the agricultural market was achieved. The best -known driver of such an expansion was technological progress that led to fundamental changes within the institution of the agricultural economy.could harvest abundant quantities, this led to a significant increase in the offer component of the economy. Companies also obtained the upper hand by being able to sell quantities of plants before they were even sown., although global companies would rarely observe the effects of their actions on the planet, people in poverty or farmers.
Another interesting factor for the quick and significant expansion of the agricultural market was the development of the food trade. In significant, the effectiveness of retail transactions currently influences shopping habits and product availability, especially within developing and industrial countries. In terms of economic perspective, the size of a food retail company determines its influence bothThe selection of consumers and the selected suppliers. The monopolization that currently exists on the market is problematic, mainly due to the fact that such companies ignore the problems of modern agricultural processes.
