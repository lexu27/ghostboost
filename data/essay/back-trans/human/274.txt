The resources presented in the module enable the discussion of the future of epidemiology and its transformation to counter the emerging challenges of a new era. Brilliant (2006) emphasizes that it is possible to eliminate epidemiological threats, especially infectious diseases, through early detection and reactionNice technologies such as big data can help scientists to understand the properties of viruses and diseases better and to achieve wider population groups (Khoury & Wei, 2015). A more efficient data acquisition and analysis enables epidemiologists that enable the causes and patterns of infections and diseasesBetter to understand what makes better detection possible. This means that technologies such as social media researchers can help react more effectively to threats by monitoring global epidemiological threats and outbreaks (Center for Infectious Dised Dynamics, 2016).Use instruments in order to deal with diseases and viruses on a larger scale. During such an approach, such an approach enables faster detection and response to threats, it is impossible to fully remove it.
Therefore, I do not agree that in the future the development of epidemiology can lead to the complete elimination of diseases, but I believe that scientists will learn to react more effectively to them with deeper knowledge, and with the help of the technology this aspect is likely to be theMortality through various diseases and infections significantly reduce... I think that in the future it will be possible to eliminate global epidemiological threats such as pandemics, but local outbursts will still occur.
