Ethnicity, culture and religion are essential elements that shape the personality of each individual. At the same time, these elements often become difficult conversations and even conflict sources. As a person who has been exposed to discrimination several times, it is important to conversations with peopleto lead through breed and cultural identity, and I am always ready to take part in them.
I have racism since I was about seven years old. My parents come from different cities in Yemen, and both sides of the family sometimes have conversations with me how their culture is better than the other. After I had migrated to QatarNegative comments and assumptions about my nationality and poverty in my home country. In the United States I stood with new racist interactions, this time with regard to my religion.to learn and appreciate.
Every time I am attacked by people who have negative views about me, I try to have a conversation with them. I am not insulted by their words because I understand that their perspectives are due to their ignorance, which is whyI always enlighten people and tell them about my beliefs and my cultural background. In this way, I am highly qualified in such conversations and always ready to participate, since in most cases people actually change their attitudes and recognize their mistakes andeven excuse.
