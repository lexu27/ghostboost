The enormously harmful effect that colonialism has caused indigenous people who have suffered oppression, and the invasion of white colonists can be accepted. In Chinua Achebe's "things fall apart", the decomposition of the local community is uninhibited as a direct effect of colonialist powerand proven powerfully. By imposing their beliefs, values, perceptions and other elements of the white culture of the residents, the colonists have almost destroyed the IBO culture, which caused their members to suffer significant cultural trauma.
In fact, the nature of the influence of the colonialists on the IBO -Volk and its culture in the title of the book is determined. The writer creates a mental picture of the entire environment and finally collapses, it shows the destructive nature of colonial power.As a result of the "division of Africa in at least fifty nation states" in Achbe's work ("things fall apart"). In addition, the IBO people are forced to teach their children the essential constructs of foreign culture, and develop a feeling of cultural lossAnd ultimately a massive common trauma ("Things fall apart: conspiracy summary"). The despair that the IBO people experience when they feel the devastating loss of their culture becomes particularly resonant in the book.
By looking at the white, western culture as the only reasonable and legitimate mental framework, white colonists have almost destroyed the IBO culture, as Achebes "things fall apart".People shoot and not only forced their members to accept the new values, philosophies and even faith, but also to teach their children to the specified cultural constructs. As the IBO community was robbed of their culture and identity, it fell apart howthe book describes lively.
