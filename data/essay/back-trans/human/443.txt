With the currently broad variety of species and the aspiring news about the species that are shortly before extinction due to the effects of environmental changes, one could believe that the discovery of new animals is no longer a possibility. However, new species are still discovered regularly,The recent incredible find is an example of this. The nimba myotis, also known as Fuzzy Orange Bat or Myotis nimbaensis, was identified as a new way this year (Simmons et al., 2021) .nimba myotis has orange -colored fur with black pigmentation andis a fairly unusual specimen of bats. The animal prefers natural caves than the place where it lives and rests.

Overall, the bat represents a unique specimen in its class.
The species belongs to the animal kingdom, especially for mammals of the Chiroptera order and the Vespertilionidae family (Simmons et al., 2021). The main reasons for placing in the animal kingdom is the fact that Nimba Myotis is a mammal.The species given in contrast to members of other kingdoms are sexually and are mult cell (Simmons et al., 2021). This is what enables the fact that cells in Nimba myotis have no cell walls, they should classify them with other species in the animal kingdom.are defined as an animal, especially as a mammalian. In addition, it should be noted that nimba myotis as a bat is the greatest order in the mammalian class according to rodents (Simmons et al., 2021).shed on the types of bats.
