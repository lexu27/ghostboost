The concept of nursing is closely linked to the idea of ​​continuous improvement, since the trends of health care have to reflect the existing social trends in order to ensure the best possible care. A way to ensure such care is to be on the latest scientificTo obtain knowledge in order to change the approaches to care in the workplace. This process of implementing research -based results in daily patient care is referred to as evidence -based practice (EBP) (Wilson & Austria, 2021).not actively used.
Firstly, the workload of most nurses contains their wish to learn and hug EBP. According to McArthur et al. (2021), a physical opportunity is a construct that contributes to the ability of the nurses to use EBM. The physical opportunities such as ""Costs and lack of resources, affect communication, employee sales and limited physical guidelines ”(McArthur et al., 2021, p. 20).For EBP in the workplace, the lack of social opportunities that are included for the lack of organizational support and teamwork (McArthur et al., 2021). Since the above examples only take a small part of the existing contestation, the need is that the need isTo intervene and make EBP easier.
The first generally mentioned approach to facilitate the use of EBP is to create a leadership that would promote practice by performing both an example as well as training courses and workshops. Another crucial moderator is to access the nurses to relevantTo secure sources in the workplace, including relevant databases, constant internet connection and subscription for publications examined by experts. This way, the use of scientific research becomes more time and less stressful for nurses.
