Daniel R. Spanjer discusses which tools are most valuable when the world is taken into account for the first time. Spanjer notes that people "neither only products of the natural world nor completely limited" (3).To lead free will of man. In this regard, Christians have to study religious worldview in order to understand how the world around them works.And its interaction with people is necessary for the understanding of the existing world and for their development in the future.
The universe consists of three essential balls that form the complex world through interaction with interaction.of the universe through its own laws. In the framework of the study of free arts, the students have to take a comprehensive look at the aspects of each of these areas, how they work together.
The main idea of ​​this chapter is therefore the need to understand the laws of the examination subject. Spanjer emphasizes that it is impossible to understand the operation principle of a certain sphere and to ignore its natural laws. This view seems to be most effective in the course of studying Christianity, since we can integrate the consideration of human essence and morality into a broader context. In this case it is important to understand that people are also part of a larger system.to structure their levels and relationships.
