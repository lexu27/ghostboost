Mary Midgley's philosophical heritage is very diverse and essentially in the body of the English -language philosophy of the second half of the 20th century.To try out the new sword is a story about refuting the theory of morality -isolationism and barriers that divide the world into independent units with its values ​​and traditions.
The central idea of ​​the article revolves around a ritual in the feudal Japan. For this goal, the samurai chops a random passerby on a cross path. Abnormal traditions exist not only in Japan, but also in other countries, since societies have different ideas for correct behavior.The author points out that your own culture affects relationships with others: it determines what people in other societies criticize (Midgley, 1981).correspond to others.
Judgments are always based on their own values, but sometimes individuals are not willing to recognize moral relativism. It is impossible to understand the complexity of religion by reducing them to a single local model and then explaining them universally.Midgley (1981)emphasizes that it is not forbidden to assess other customs, but should not set barriers and have to understand your own culture before evaluating another.They all integrate constantly, especially in the modern world.
