In the context of the law enforcement authorities, a gratification is a gift to operating partners based on their job.In contrast to bribes, drink money is a voluntary gesture without effects (Fleming, 2019). However, there is a blurred limit between tips, tips and bribes, and it is the main argument against the approval of drinking money.
If I were the chief of police, I would work to ensure that the tips will be maintained a neutral public image of the law enforcement organization. In the opinion, the first step in the direction of corruption or at least is understood as such.I believe that the acceptance of drinking money should be banned for police officers, and in most cases an oral commendation is sufficient.
