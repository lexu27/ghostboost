In the article, several reasons were emphasized why women have decided to be children -free. This includes the desire to be successful from an academic and professional perspective, financial reasons, a lack of natural wishes and understanding that a child has his lifewould not improve, but would make it more difficult (Sandler).
There were a few things that I cannot completely agree with. The choice of a woman in a serious relationship with a man with a 15-year-old daughter without taking on minimal parental responsibility seems to be both for the young girlThe perspective of the child -free woman as well as from the father, who accepts them, ruthlessly to be.who did not get married and had children, almost had no opportunities in society.
Based on the materials I have read, I would say that it is a choice to be child -free that everyone can meet the life and efforts of the person. A woman can be happy on the one hand to build a solid career and no wishto make changes for a child, which makes it inappropriate to have one unless love and care can be made available.Financial, professional and social problems. However, every woman is different and lives in a modern world, it means an individual decision to have or not have or not have or not have that every person should make because of her own life experiences and overviews.
