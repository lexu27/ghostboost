The topic of education is not of central importance, but also closely in the "everyday use" by Alice Walker and "Sonny's Blues" by James Baldwin. The research of this topic in two short stories showed that Baldwin has a more important focus on education, which withWalker was comparable, but still contain both stories similar terms, topics and educational perception.
These short stories tell about siblings: Walker's work tells about two sisters, while Baldwin describes the life of two brothers. In both stories one of the siblings completed the high school while another was missing.and comparing the intelligence of siblings. In both stories, the authors first emphasize the success that is associated with the education and necessity of school visit.)., the narrator of "everyday use", "mentioned a lot that we do not necessarily have to know" and referred to the dee training of her daughter (Walker 50). She does not exaggerate the importance of education because it was not trained,but had a lot of valuable knowledge and skills.
Interestingly, siblings and more conscious for certain topics and topics appear in both stories.Those who were able to visit the high school and a graduate seemed to maintain the right to condemn less happy people by default. Stories of Walker and Baldwin revealed the truth: special skills, secular knowledge, daily human experiences and understanding of life can often be in high.School cannot be reached.
