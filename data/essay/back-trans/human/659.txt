Essentially, the cause is the independent variable; its value remains unchanged by the other factors in research. The effect is the dependent variable, and changes influence its importance in the independent variable. The relationship between the independent and dependent variables is the focus of theResearch (Pokhariyal, 2019). The independent variable in the research idea is the situation in which people feel nervous and insecure. This is the dependent variable the level of conformity of people when they are confronted in stressful situations.Conditions whether people have more conformity.
The two most important features of each research are reliability and validity. Laut Cypress (2017) corresponds to the strict research of the ideas of reliability and validity that are all decisive quality components.As his (Cypress, 2017). The scientific reliability element presupposes that repeated study measurements with the same results using objective procedures demonstrate the truthfulness of the observations.
In order to measure the validity and reliability of the research idea, it is therefore crucial to examine the consistency of preserved data on situations and human reactions and tendencies for conformism. The use of research techniques with consistency and care leads to reliability, which is in the transparency of research practices,Interpretations and results make it clear. Appreciated research should prove what appears and factual, and a valid instrument or a valid measurement should evaluate what it should examine (Cypress, 2017).and be up to date. The secondary data and previous examinations could be compared with the primary data obtained. The situations and conditions and the measurement instruments selected for the study should not change during the examinations in order to correctly assess and compare the level of conformity.
