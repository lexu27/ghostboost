I checked the videos for job seekers: how to negotiate your pt. 1 and tips for job seekers: advice on personal branding PT.2 who were helpful for planning interviews. From the first video I learned that itIt is necessary to present value and uniqueness if you ask for a salary increase that is also applicable to personal branding (Careerbuilder, 2012).that you have the skills and ideas that the company could appreciate. The other ability is flexibility; it is important to take several options into account if you negotiate something so that situations can convert into win-win events.
The focus of the second video was closer to the topic of personal branding. The most important information was that you should be honest if you imagine a company because it shows whether the employee would be more satisfied with his own work (Carrierbuilding, 2013).
The skills on which one can concentrate are added value, negotiation, flexibility and openness. They are important because they make a particularly presentable person for an employer.since they are components of a personal brand. The knowledge of a manager about branding is mandatory. This information includes part of the skills for a person who wants to promote and work with people professionally.work with employees and understand their value.
