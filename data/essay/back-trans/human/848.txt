The racial spectrum strains strongly the history of the United States and Canada and repeatedly shapes the life experiences of blacks that live in both countries. Laut Reynolds (2016) is not only a central element of history and culture, but also writing and readingHistory. For this reason, the Canadian policy of multiculturalism has contributed to the introduction of the Black History month, which originally came from the USA and took place every February.honor the legacy of black people and their communities.
The Black History Month in Canada was beneficial for schools, which teaches.She came to school every February to read stories to children and give them a black perspective on their history. After the opinion of Prince (2009) it is simply a crumbs that are offered to be satisfied with black people thereand to stop there. To strengthen the compartment version of the history of the black people who only immortalize a hegemony who denies its existence. A example of this was a librarian suggestion that Prince read from a collection of Anansi stories, instead ofSomething that she chose from the book of her children. This was justified by the fact that none of the children in the audience was black, but all understood Anansi and Prince's Book in general.Because that was a classic case of attempts to suppress an independent cultural vision that it should deliver.
Therefore, an integrative curriculum must not only be taken into account - it is an absolute necessity. To dedicate twenty -eight days of black perspective and then ignore it for the rest of the year, the government should implement the research of world history into the regular curriculum.It is not only for the destruction of harmful myths and a more comprehensive understanding of the cause-effect relationship between certain events-the feeling that black children feel represented. For a country that is proud to promote multicultural politicsall of this are just as important.
