Gnomial Functions Inc. would like to determine the most reliable forecasting technology for determining the sales level for the next eighteen months. In the past 18 months, sales trend has reflected a consistent increase with minimal seasonal variations. However, sales of the past few months have had sales for the following monthsof greater importance (Wisniewski, 2016).
The weighted average used four weights used to determine the probable level of sales in the next month. This weights were between 0.1 and 0.4.Higher weight. Infiten eats the weighted, sliding average creates a precise forecast compared to the simple moving average values.
The company can achieve an even more precise prognosis by adapting the weights for the sliding average. The management should give the recent monthly sales a higher weight to reduce the forecast error.(0.1, 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4) was 6.27 and 47.29.Meaning, being used, the average absolute deviation went to 4.81 and the average standard error takes 27.28. This performance is better than the simple sliding average.
Gnomial Functions Inc. should use the weighted, sliding average to determine the probable level of sales next year. This method is simple, effective and reliable., to ensure the necessary importance for the past few months. The company should use a weighted moving average in order to estimate the likely performance in the coming year.
