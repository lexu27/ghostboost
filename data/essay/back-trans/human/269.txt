The monster is described as ugly and strong, but at the same time inexperienced.Immediately announced that it was immediately informed that it was the misery ‚Äù(Shelley). Domesty of his ugly and terrible appearance was not intended to kill people.

The "Gothic" elements of the novel include supernatural motifs, the architecture from the Middle Ages and the spiritual aspects of human nature.

Mary Shelley's husband believed that inappropriate social relationships are the result that people get angry. In addition to making people bad, other representatives of society should reject them and make them feel useless or bad.

I believe that one of the integral issues of novel is loneliness. The Monster aimed at integrating into society; however, people met him with disgust, fear, hatred and the entire spectrum of negative emotions. Because of that, because of the creatureThe feeling of loneliness closed to evil, hut it often tries to isolate people who do not see the world as most people do. This function often leads to feeling, being lost and lonely.
