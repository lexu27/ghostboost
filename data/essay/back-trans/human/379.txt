John Smeaton was an English engineer who designed bridges, channels and lighthouses. In the article written by Andrew M. A. Morris, the author shows how this renowned engineer used parameter variation in a much broad context as part of an analytical procedure (Morris, 2021).Morris emphasizes the three different goals of such a process, including optimization, theoretical tests and maximum development through explorative tests.
As the writer expresses it, the basic point of this study is that Smeaton has carried out more than improved engineering processes through the systematizing previous manual paths, as well as the traditional interpretation of the Smaton method defined by technology analysts in the 1990s (Morris, 2021). Rather, claims that his method establishes a connection between science and technology by being involved in both theoretical tests and practical tests (Morris, 2021). I agree with the author and believe that John Smeaton successfully perform the traditionally seen hypothesent tests andhave developed empirical regularities through exploratory experiments. During some scientists, some scientists claim that no scientific research was involved in the work of Smeaton, the engineer managed to carry out a thorough analysis and create his own maxims.
Morris also discussed the relationship between science and technology during industrial revolution.reflecting. According to information from the first two researchers, science was an essential aspect of industrial period (Morris, 2021). Hall believes that the technical innovations from the 18th century are almost nothing due to the science of the era.
As I see it, Hall's opinion has no solid floor. In my view, the industrial revolution was an amalgam from technology, science and industry.It is known that natural forms of energy such as wind and water were used in the early stages of the revolution to generate electricity.To enable revolution.
