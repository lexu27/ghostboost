In Mesopotamia and Egypt, the first kings worked with priests in a similar way and were dependent on their support. The Egyptian kings, especially known as pharaohs in the entire region, were clearly above the priests, while Mesopotami kings worked closely (Brooks, 2019). Another important difference is the origin of the rulers of the state, since Mesopotamian kings were also warriors who led their people in battles with their neighbors, while Egyptian pharaons were regarded as God's kings (Brooks, 2019).to Mesopotamia a central unit that was several separate conditions.
In addition, there were differences in the religious prospects of alternative views of why the gods created humans. Mesopotamians considered gods as cruel and believed that people could not enjoy life and insult the gods (Brooks, 2019).Egyptians did not believe in life after death, possibly because of the attitude of god towards humans. In Egypt, a religious ethical code led that approved every citizen by gods (circle, 2006).Such an essential part of their beliefs - it was a process that rated their quality throughout life.
The religious and agricultural development inevitably led to the intellectual and cultural progress of the countries. The middle kingdom of Egypt is famous for his papyrus use together with ink and cosmetics (Brooks, 2019).The warfare and trade typical of Mesopotamia explain their creation of the wheel and a significant improvement in architecture and sciences (Brooks, 2019). It can be assumed that religion played an important role in the groundbreaking inventions of Egypt (district, 2006). In general, the most important differences between the regions made of contrasting religious and political systems.
