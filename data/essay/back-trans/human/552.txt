After the comprehensive feasibility of the bioethanol plant was carried out, it was obvious that 10,000 Terapascal of the pressure in ethanol production was economical compared to the visual capacity of the current market.of the river is to reduce the costs in the event that water areas are far from the bioethanolic work. The manufacture and processing of ethanol requires a lot of water in its processes (Velazquez-Lucio et al. 2018, 452)It is of great importance to have a lot of water during the manufacturing and processing processes.
