Social media platforms have complicated algorithms that suggest information or advertising according to the interests of the users., to maintain the user's attention. I started to view this theory of this theory to look at a lot of videos about ice shots. In the following, every third video on a tickock was to do with this special topic.They rarely appear in my Tikok field. The same algorithm works when I start to skip interesting videos and see something I did..
Instagram and YouTube have the same algorithm system, and the proposed advertising is usually based on previous Google research.Or have regarded stories on Instagram. This is where some algorithms have the opportunity to remember audio, and while the systems are spoken to someone, the systems can appear different product names and advertising actions in the area of ​​social media. On the one hand, this technology could be helpful,Since people can see different information according to their interests. This may not be disturbing and sometimes suggest the required products.It could be scary for some people and the level of trust could decrease.
