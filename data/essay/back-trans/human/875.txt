Communication and cooperation are decisive elements for the success of individual and team efforts. The first chapter of the book Technical Communication offers an insight into the aspects of technical communication and its importance.
I discovered that technical communication is concerned with two main tasks: people learning about certain phenomena or the completion of a certain task. In addition, technical communication can cause others to strengthen their attitudes, to change them or even take certain measuresAlso stated that technical documents reflect the organizational culture, take place in cooperation and have special elements, including a specific reader, clear instructions for solving a problem, design, images and the words.Workplace was a valuable ability because people can read and produce technical documents.
In cooperation with my colleagues and other students, I have had many different experiences.The team active brainstorming was involved, and every time they tried to present their perspectives, they were interrupted by other people., if speaking had been passed in turn. The positive experience in cooperation included a school project via zoom in which everyone contributed their respective share., who supervised and coordinated the actions of all supervised and coordinated.
I believe that successful cooperation in an online environment has to be based on planning and strategy. In essence, it is important to assign certain roles to all members and plan all sessions to avoid planning problems., who is familiar with everyone, to achieve success, a group has to rely on collaborative tools such as zoom and joint online documents.
Technical communication promotes cooperation between people by helping individuals to learn, make decisions and act for others. In terms of technical communication skills, people as specialists can be more valuable and influence their ability to work in teams.
