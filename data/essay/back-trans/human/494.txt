President Franklin Roosevelt did a lot to end the global economic crisis that included adopted actions and laws, not only aimed at restoring the economy and infrastructure, but also improving the situation of certain groups of the population., created the health clinics, special courses, university buildings, new schools and recreation institutions and thus increase their quality of life.
The first act I would like to analyze is the creation of the administration of public work (PWA). It was a federal American agency that was created during the New Deal of President Franklin Roosevelt (Corbett, 2014).In addition to the recovery by the global economic crisis, workers, immigrants and african Americans with jobs and necessary social infrastructure also offered the law specializing in construction and public work, which also formulated an improvement in the industrial area.
The next law that I consider is Agricultural Adjustment Act (AAA). This law focused on improving agricultural areas by reducing their land damage (week 6 lessons, 2022).Not only to engage people to participate in the agricultural spectrum, but also to promote the improvement of the African American, immigrant and employee conditions. It helped farmers when the prices for the corps increased;Another side because people had to pay more money to buy them.
In my opinion, the New Deal made a significant contribution to the recovery of the global economic crisis, and many agencies were created that aimed at improving various areas..
