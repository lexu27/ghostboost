The emergence of the information society has triggered the further creation of several possibilities to check the current socio -cultural, socio -economic and sociopolitical questions. In particular, the problem of inequalities in the modern community was determined as one of the most important global concerns (Chakravarty 298). The civil society organizations as bodies,that deals with the presence of injustice, have used additional efforts to treat the observed injustice. The postcolonial context must be clearly understood to build the World Summit on Information Society (WSIS) in order to build guidelines on the basis of the concept of justice.
A similar feeling is expressed in Aginam's essay, in which the author introduces an example of a situation in which the power of the WIS has to tackle the problem of inequality. In particular, according to aginam, the focus on the transcultural economy and the inclusion of a larger pallet of globalParticipants in the trading process enable some of the existing inequalities (247). In particular, through the search for partnerships and business expansion opportunities with foreign communities, one can concentrate on building socio -economic equality and increasing the voices of victims of colonialism.
The idea of ​​supporting minority countries in the post -colonial economy with the help of WSIs and the associated organizations seems to be promising.that practical control instruments are introduced, which is why a global communication channel for postcolonial communities is required.
